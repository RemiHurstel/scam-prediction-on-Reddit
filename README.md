Online scams are a prevalent issue on social media platforms such as Reddit. Scammers use deceptive tactics to lure unsuspecting users into fraudulent schemes, resulting in financial loss and other negative consequences. The detection of these scams is a challenging task, as scammers often use subtle language and manipulation techniques to evade detection. Therefore, the problem statement is to develop an effective scam prediction model for Reddit that can accurately identify and alert users to potential scam posts and comments, ultimately reducing the risk of financial harm and improving the overall safety and trustworthiness of the platform.
