The Middle Card - The Present\n-  reversed 5 of swords\n- looking for a peaceful resolution for the situation\n\nPath 1 ( lowest to highest)\n1. The immediate future\n- 7 of wands\n- now that I've got this full-time job. I've got to fight the challenges to keep myself in place. It can be mentally and physically\n\n2. The obstacles\n- 9 of cups\n- I'll be struggling to be emotionally satisfied or even happy.\n\n3. The advice\n- reversed The Empress\n- take care of yourself and embrace your feminity\n\n4. The ultimate outcome\n- 10 of wands, the world, strength\n- there might be perceived stress and burden. And I'll be taking a lot to myself. But in the end after all that challenges is done, no one can hurt me anymore other than myself. I'm on top of the world. My inner strength has improved significantly.\n\nPath 2 (lowest to highest)\n1. The immediate future\n- Death\n- there will be significant changes in your life. The good and the bad. But changes are needed for a better life\n\n2. The obstacles\n- reversed 7 of swords\n- I'll be having imposter syndrome for this job. Thinking I'm no good enough blablabla\n\n3. The advice\n- reversed hanged man\n- just stop. STOP! breathe. Wait for things to get clearer and assess it from another angle\n\n4. The ultimate outcome\n- 4 of wands, 3 of swords, knight if pentacles\n- there will be celebrations and heartbreaks and that's life. No situation will be consistent.

I still love music and I was thinking about maybe picking up the ol\u2019 drum sticks again. But the idea just doesn\u2019t intrigue me that much if I\u2019m not practicing for an important gig. In the past six years, I\u2019ve played some really cool gigs, on national radio and for big crowds of people. Without those kind of rewards, I just don\u2019t get motivated.\nAs I\u2019m writing this, I\u2019m realizing that I need a relatively large payoff as incentive to do something.\n\nI don\u2019t know, just a random thought I wanted to share.

I saw from Google that you can store cooked quinoa in the fridge for 5-7 days in an airtight container. And if not airtight, bacteria may form and the food may gone bad sooner.\n\nNow I was wondering if it's okay to store all cooked Quinoa in one container. But that also means, every meal daily I have to **open the container to get a part of quinoa, allowing some air contact with the food**, then cover it again and put back in the fridge.\n\nOr should it be strictly stored that Quinoa servings must be in separate container so that you'd only open the Quinoa container when you use it? Which means, if you eat twice a day, you need **14 containers** in the fridge, each for 1 serving of Cooked Quinoa.\n\nThanks a lot to whoever will help me with this \ud83d\ude06."

This is on Friday, registration day.\n\nWe waited for the next day's reset so that the registration will be closed / locked / official, and so we can go back to main alliance to do events.\n\nQuestion :\n\n- We were told by academy leader that we weren't able to register despite only exiting from alliance after reset. Is this true or is he only bluffing seeing we did not stay in their alliance and went back to the main ?\n\nPS. However, we know we really have to go back to the alliance where we will do AoO maybe 2 to 3 hours before game but question is, are we really registered or been removed ?\n\nThank you so much !\n\n---\n\nETA : Hey guys thank you so much ! Indeed, we were able to play and a lot didn't like how the leader responded. I think he's just jealous or what cos a lot of people went back to main.

Leaving aside whether humans or a habitable planet will even still exist by then, which I *very* much doubt, almost all of us have consumed a lot of science-fiction, which is likely to psychologically inoculate us against a vast range of possible future outcomes and technologies and cultures.\n\nFurthermore, electricity and fossil fuel exploitation *radically* changed pretty much everything someone from 200 years ago would perceive about today.  In order to achieve the same degree of culture shock for us, we'd need some equally-radical technological development, like a combination of ubiquitous direct-brain interfacing and personal teleporters and on-demand body remodeling; but even those could be *explained* to someone of today.  If I took a cellphone back to the year 1823 and tried to explain its principles of operation to an average person-on-the-street, you'd have to start with things like atoms and subatomic particles and electromagnetism that we take for granted but might not be comprehensible at all, given that humans think analogically and might not even have a frame of reference to which such concepts could be mapped.\n\nI think that if humans still actually exist, they'll only do so if they've developed some pretty amazing tech to fix everything wrong with the planet and the various cultures.  But although we probably wouldn't understand exactly how it works, I very much doubt it would be conceptually incomprehensible.  I think it'd be a lot more like me taking a laptop computer back to the 1950s and showing desktop-publishing software to someone who operated a printing press; that person might not understand how it works under the hood, but all of the paradigms would be recognizeable, including an extrapolation from both typewriters and television.

How can I fix this, cause removing the filament and having to reinsert it every time I wanna use the printer would be pretty annoying and would definitely make me use less the printer, so can anyone give me any explanation of why this happens and maybe help me find a solution?

Please give up to three examples to prove your point with personnal playing experience. Thank you, and have a wonderful day !\n\n I wonder if my teacher is on that subreddit too lmao"

(I finished it)\nIf you don't know why already with what I said, I guess you liked the show a lot. I kind of did, but all the 7 last episode I was wondering they have the ghost key, they have an ancestor that can teach them everything, they KNOW he's here, and yet they do nothing about it. They never lost the ghost key, I don't want to watch it again just to be sure but at least Kinsey and Bode know about Chamberlain, Duncan too, not sure about Tyler but still. \n\nIf it's because he will be used later, why show him ? Why make Bode say he will come back ? \nIf he's \"useless\" and can't help with informations, why not make the kids (or one of them) go ask him and make Chamberlain say he doesn't know or whatever...\n\nI really can't wrap my head around this, so many things could, in my opinion, have been prevented/avoided etc if they just asked Chamberlain as soon as they found him. You don't show the magical ghost of the family that know about the keys if you're not going to ask him anything... \n\nI don't know if someone has an explanation but imo this is a really bad mistake. :/"

The skill ceiling is high tho,and the game can be quite complicated, and require some constant practice to get good at. If this is fine in exchange for an extremely expressive, fluid, and spectacular game then Melee is the right one. Melee is complicated, but pure art in it\u2019s own way. I also never felt the satisfaction I had with Melee on Ultimate. Implementing tech, tactics feels extremely more rewarding, and it\u2019s definitely more about you than game mechanics, I\u2019m looking at you buffer system. The combo tree in Melee is also something else, it\u2019s basically a sandbox, where any move can lead into each other and things can get crazy even with characters generally considered \u201clame\u201d like Puff. Also you have Uncle Punch, 20XX, and Slippi (Online Netplay, which is crazy good, with almost no lag) to make sure your experience is great. On the other hand it\u2019s easier to get better, it\u2019a more simple game, with a bigger community, with more content on the way and an ever evolving meta ( which is the case for Melee too, but in a different way ). You can get to top lever quicker and in an easier way than Melee, and the skill ceiling is definitely lower. This comes at the price of what I have listed as Melee\u2019s strengths. Seen this, find out what do you like best and choose. I highly raccomand you pick one, for how radically buffer system affects gameplay in Ultimate, and how characters are different... if you wanna be good at one game, Melee especially you gotta focus on one. Hope it\u2019s helpful!",

I know what my stoner dudes do when they can't find a plug, they go to the liquor store to get their fix instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Its either that or legalise everything and make it a medical issue.\n\nMy opinion is to legalize everything, but an argument could easily be made that drugs below a certain \"harm factor rating\" should be legalized, while the drugs that surpass this harm factor rating would be made illegal. Legalizing cannabis on its own would be great. ID required for minors, tax system relief, and money out of the pockets of the gangs (meaning, hopefully, less fart-sounding harleys). If the people can get a better product, while contributing to tax, we can control the substance far better than we can right now. Run the gangs out of business, contribute some of the tax towards education and harm reduction.",

Even the axiom of choice (the C in ZFC), which is relatively tame compared to this, is not very popular.\n\nPersonally I'm a big fan of na\u00efve set theory and I think anyone looking for any kind of practical application should be too. Imo these kinds of foundational reasonings are mostly just so that we can declare maths \"consistent\". We invented them based on our perception of the world, to model our intuition in a formal and rigorous way. \n\nThere's an old saying in physics: \"there are no infinities in nature\". That's not to say that our model of nature doesn't have any, just nature itself doesn't. So I'd be VERY surprised to learn that anything other than countable/continuous is of any use in practice, even with sci fi technology.\n\nFor the record: I'm not a physicist, but I find foundational mathematics very... let's say, \"for its own sake\". Same goes for logic. I study geometry, if I can't draw that I don't know that, I love intuition and am probably very biased because of that, so someone more expert in set theory could very well disagree with me here, but given that even them didn't bother to give a name to these beasts I find that unlikely.",

She didn't have any intentions to get with other people for \"a long time\", according to her. Very sad times, but I eventually got over it, thanks to my friends who were there for me. I moved on, started boxing, exercising and going out more often.\n\nUnfortunately, despite overwhelming advice not to, I kept in contact with her, because I'm damn weak and still had some fondness for this girl (we were each other's first and were together for so long after all...). Boy was everyone right.\n\nOn friday she texted me she had sex with someone else, without commitment (she asked me if I had met anyone, so I replied \"no, what about you?\"). My beautiful sweet precious first true love had conceded herself to the first piece of shit she found on tinder not even six months after we broke up never to see him again.\n\nNow, I've never been a violent man in my life, I've always despised that, but I had never seen as much red. I went for a walk to clear my mind and found myself punching road signs until my hands started bleeding. Came home, found a plushie she had gifted me years ago and set it on fire. Took a shower to calm down and started uncontrollably growling like a dog. Came out and started shouting and punching the wall (I was home alone).\n\nNormally I would just go boxing to blow off some steam or go out with my friends to distract myself, but it turns out that ***with impeccable timing*** I got covid and am stuck at home with my family (who don't know about this).\n\nI have a very big uni exam on wednesday but can't get myself to study. I'm taking valerian to calm down but it ain't working, I can't get the image of her with someone else out of my head.\n\nHow do you fucking cope with this? How is it that civilization exists at all given that if I, a generally not violent person, were free to walk for the streets of my city I'd punch to death the first person who looks at me wrong? I know I'm not the first nor the last one to experience this, so how does everyone else come to terms with this without resorting to acts of violence or destruction?\n\nTL;DR found out ex moved on, am very angry and stuck at home with family due to covid, what do?\n\nP.S. Please note that \"dude just let her go\" is not a welcome answer. I know I shouldn't care, but yet here we are."

But now it's been 2 weeks since this escapade, so here you go reddit.\n\nI'm a man dating a man who I met online at the beginning of the year. It's going great. I love him lots!! We get along, we vc every night. We sext once a week. We make time for eachother and we compliment eachother's needs and wants. It's great.\n\nMy parents don't know I am gay, and I believe they are starting to suspect. My mother and I had a conversation about it, I came out to her, she basically told me \"No you're not gay, think of what your family would think, I didn't raise you that way. You're too young, your just a kid who feels lonely so you're hiding in this gay shit.\" At the end she essentially gave me the option for therapy (regular therapy) and I'm now back in the closet cause apparently according to her. \"I'm not gay.\" I didn't tell her I'm dating a man, cause the situation was volatile, and she said if I was gay, and I was making this decision, that she would kick me out for sure in two weeks. And stop paying for my school for a degree I'm not interested in. I am too inexperienced for that, and I have no money, I don't know what fucking century she's living in, but my god. I guess I'm not gay lol? \n\nThe issue is how she found out. My boyfriend and I were talking at 10:30 at night, and my mom knocked on my door, asking me if I was being intimate with a man, if I was in a relationship with one, if I had been. I lied multiple times until I got tired of it and came out to her and everything in the above paragraph ensues. I have no privacy.\n\nEverywhere I go in my house I have to be careful what I do and what I say when I'm talking to him cause they are always listening. I hear them waiting outside my door, and have caught them twice lingering and listening in. It's exhausting and it's getting on my nerves. They've gotten to the point where they unlock my door from the outside and walk into my room while I'm chatting, or watching a show, or playing a game. Without knocking or asking. It's like they are trying to catch me. My boyfriend absolutely hates this. So do I.\n\nI want to officially come out and tell them I'm dating a man, but if I do that, they'll cut me off, kick me out, and I don't have enough saved up to sustain myself. Which is what my goal is by the end of the summer. I'm also at the end going to tell them I am not going to study what they want me to and they can just suck it and kick me out if they want. I don't think I'll come out again, I'm not ready for that. \n\nI'm sorry this is just so ranty, there's no coherence in what I said. It's just blah. There's so much more to this that I didn't include but it's just so much. I don't know what to do. I love my parents but man... Any advice I guess? If you took the time to read this thankyou!!!"

I\u2019m only a freshmen in college and he\u2019s in his 50s and he expects to behave like we are brothers while also being an ass, he eats the snacks from my drawer during rehearsals, he talks shit about me to my other costars when he isn\u2019t on stage or isn\u2019t rehearsing. He does this dumb thing while rehearsing when he doesn\u2019t like his delivery, he stops the whole thing and says \u201cCan we do that again?\u201d And it\u2019s super annoying. I\u2019cave tried asking him to bring his own food and maybe stop telling people I\u2019m an amateur. But he flipped out and told people I\u2019m suffering from main character syndrome and am being narcissistic. My co stars are pretty understanding but he\u2019s only really a jerk to me. Idk why?! I\u2019ve tried going to the director but their reaction is to \u201cstick it out for another month and a half.\u201d Any tips? Why is he doing this? I hate drama but I don\u2019t know what else to do."

I don't expect any particular amount of time but when something is good you shouldn't be afraid to enjoy it until it's time to go. \n\nI think though that someday I might find someone who didn't want to leave, and I think I could just commit to being loyal to them. Not that everything will be perfect with that relationship, but if we are both loyal to one another then maybe it would work long term. I think most people are not loyal and not committed to anything for long, but in rare occasions there are.",

Dokja's modifier is >!Demon King of Salvation!< and at the end of the book, is revealed to have always been >!The Oldest Dream (Most Ancient Dream)!<.\n\nAlso, it's practical, because honestly, would you want to know the Black Flame Dragon's real (and extraordinarily long and hard to pronounce) name when you could understand him just from his modifier?\n\nFor example, here are some modifiers with gods that are not named but it's pretty obvious who they are without needing their true names.\n\nEarth Mother - Gaia, the Earth Goddess of the Greek Pantheon\n\nGreat Mother God Who Created Man out of Earth - Nuwa, the mother goddess of Chinese Mythology\n\nBTW, incarnations also have modifiers if you are high enough up.  Yoo Sangah was \"Moonlight Girl,\" but her modifier got upgraded to \"Moonlight Empress\" after>! Dokja died and came back three years later after going to the 1863rd round.!<\n\nHan Sooyoung has a really cool modifier too: Black Flames Empress, and after >! Dokja died and came back three years later after going to the 1863rd round.!< she got a new modifier, Black Flames Demon Ruler.  I think it suits her really well! \n\nHan Sooyoung also had another modifier in the 1863rd round, Director of the Last False Act, >!and she was a constellation in that round.!<",

This was over a span of a little less than 2 months.\n\nNow, just a disclaimer, I have absolutely NO problem with her being interested in a girl. It\u2019s just that I believe my friend felt obligated to say yes to dating her. She has admitted to being loyal to a fault, and it\u2019s really hard for me to see her go through that because I can tell she\u2019s in pain. \n\nMy friend\u2019s family life has always been turbulent; her mom is more like a friend to her than a parent and she definitely favors her sister (19f)  over her. She told me today her mom calls her sister (who just graduated from navy school) at least 4-5 times a day, and only talks to her about her sister. Her dad is very distant and her brother (20m) doesn\u2019t live with them because they would fight and he was really creepy towards her and her sister. This is relevant because I believe my friend is craving attention, even if it\u2019s unhealthy. She goes over to her girlfriend\u2019s house pretty much 24/7 now. \n\nI believe the girlfriend is really unstable. My friend told me that she\u2019s been adopted because her mom is in jail for meth use and her dad is also in jail because he was the head of a drug cartel. She has anger issues, and she\u2019s super jealous (specifically of my friend\u2019s other friends) for no reason. Apparently, she only wants to meet me which is surprising since I\u2019m my friend\u2019s closest friend. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated, my friend doesn\u2019t have access to therapy and I want to be able to support her somehow without being accusatory.\n\nTL;DR: My friend (17f) is dating a problematic girl (also 17f) she has only known for 2 months"

Stuck in a cycle of doctors appointments and medication, everything you try to do makes no difference and you\u2019re just stuck.\n\nLike Happy Death Day, at times you go crazy dealing with a timeless assassin out to get you. Like Palm Springs, you can\u2019t drag anyone else into it, they\u2019re all out living their lives like normal outside of your endless loop. So you just accept it.\n\nHonestly I wouldn\u2019t mind death, maybe that\u2019s my anxiety and depression talking, yet I can\u2019t commit suicide because I couldn\u2019t do that to my loved ones, I\u2019m scared, and I don\u2019t want to look like a quitter. So I sit here and take it because nothing even matters anymore.\n\nMy whole life I\u2019ve wanted to better the world, and create things that could change people\u2019s lives for the better. Then I had to drop out of school for mechanical and biomedical engineering. I may lose my full ride scholarship I\u2019ve been working my whole life to get/keep.\n\nI love music, I\u2019m in a band, and I know a ton of music theory, can play tons of instruments, do improv jazz, you name it. Yet my brain is so stuck that I can\u2019t find the creative light to write anything. The perfectionism of OCD eats at me, I can\u2019t write music, I can\u2019t get out of bed, I can\u2019t help change the world, I can\u2019t eat, I can\u2019t see clearly, walking is hard, everything is endless in this unforgiving time loop.\n\nSo I sit here, thinking, even though it causes physical mind boggling pain, even the beating of my heart is painful, and I\u2019ve just stopped caring, everything I do doesn\u2019t help, countless meds, voodoo, procedures, and cooky life advice tried, what\u2019s the point? I can feel myself slipping closer into insanity as I binge another cartoon, not because I want to, but because it passes the time and distracts from the pain."

A big part of lucid dreaming is reality checks which is questioning the reality you\u2019re in throughout the day, which sounds way more like derealization than shifting is.\n\nDerealization is feeling like nothing is real while shifting is the exact opposite- the belief that everything is real. I\u2019ve even heard lucid dreamers say that it\u2019s easy to confuse their dreams with reality, so does that mean lucid dreaming can also cause psychosis and derealization?

In this hyper-focused individualistic and materialistic society, too many people are quick to equate other's attempts at self-love for narcissism or egoism. I say love yourself, prioritize yourself, and be willing to be your best advocate because no one else, truly no one else can do that for you. And stop judging other people who have a deeper sense of affection and care for themselves.   \n\n\nIt truly is sad and a heavy sign of compensation in our society when the tiniest sliver of self-love or care for oneself is equated with a personality disorder, truly a sign of these sick times. Did we come here to hate on ourselves? Are we just born to resent our own existence? No.   \n\n\nWhen I see someone who is willing, and strong enough to display certain qualities associated with self-love such as pride for their accomplishments, contentment towards themselves, appreciation directed inwardly and also forgiving qualities such as the ability to understand and rationalize their own behaviors as if they were leading their child self by the hand...  \n\n\nThat's when I know I am in the presence of a truly healthy person, whose love radiates within. Someone with solid foundations when it comes to giving and practicing love because they have practiced it towards themselves, first.    \n\n\nAlso, too many people in these world know how to give, how to victimize themselves, but too little know how to properly receive. Try it on yourself. Be kind to yourself, love yourself. It's difficult to love someone who doesn't love themselves.",

                "body": "''Don't fix it if it ain't broke''.   \nI think this is the general measure to implement here.   \nI'm going to speak from experience here, as I have almost a good decade on you. \n\nDon't try to fix yourself, because you might not be broke.   \nHere's what I mean.  You mention that there is a long standing history of support and therapeutic or pharmaceutic psychiatric treatment strategies effectively implemented from your caretakers ever since childhood.   \nI am going to be honest here. I think in 99% of the cases, children do not need medication and from a bio-ethic standpoint should not have their neurological systems fundamentally altered while still developing (much like I don't agree with sex change procedures or hormonal stunting for transgender children until age majority and informed consent and decision can be made). \n\nYou are clearly aware of this mistreatment, even though it may have stemmed from good intentions. There is also extensive literature and anecdotal evidence of long-term side effects as a result of prolonged psychiatric medication intake, namely the definite alteration of mind state, which can translate easily to the condition worsening, or becoming dependent on it as it creates dependency which can not offer the option to try to go without, anymore.   \n\n\nDon't fix it if it ain't broke, also means allowing your children the room to grow, and overcome themselves through the challenges of early life. It allows for them to feel, and mature through a range of emotions, and seeking to control them from a covert or overt standpoint, is not necessary or advised. Some children may be more prone to being sanguine, or choleric.   \nOthers may also be cyclothymic to employ a psychiatric concept, meaning that their mood is fleeting and easily changes. Should you equate this volatility with disorder? Think of children being essentially, medical-grade (meth)amphetamines to respond to their highly creative, chaotic nature, or ADD/ADHD.   \n\n\nWhat most people should understand about mental disorders, is the misconception around the notion of imbalance between genetic predisposition and environment. A lot of people, will say that they are being given generic advice on self-care directly relating to lifestyle as a coping strategy for their disorders, such as depression. ''Go out more, get some fresh air,etc.''\n\nWhile this is not entirely wrong, one has to understand that by lifestyle and environment, you have to consider a much broader scale of effect there. A lot of people land lock themselves in an environment which highly depresses them, personal objectives which they are only partially invested in (dead end job, dispassionate studies, etc...) and view these as immobile, unchangeable and permanent aspects of their lifestyle. And hence, they may think ''going for that daily walk around the block, like they advise me, makes no difference.'' \n\nTake a long walk. I mean, leave. Everything about your circumstances is not currently working for you. You need to paint with much, much broader strokes here, when it comes to making a change. \n\nI want you to take a true good look at your current life. And ask yourself, not how can I patch the holes in this sinking ships with coping strategies and metaphorical bandaids in form of medication or therapy methods. I want to ask yourself, if I was living in a different environment, doing different things, would I be happier or more importantly, more stable?\n\nMaybe you don't cope well with the stress of university, maybe it's the added stress of your parents trying to shape and mold you, and instilling from early age the idea that you were broken. Well you're not. But you are in a different way. You were broken so you could fit a mold, and the tracks set on life by your parents. They needed you ''in (a) shape'' to take on the specific road they built for you. \n\nBut maybe you're meant to do something else, live a different way. A way that makes you happier and healthier. You need to reassess, and ask yourself if your life is worth burning a few bridges, and destroying the few projected dreams of your parents which they expect you to fulfill on their behalf.   \n\n\nYou have a tendency to approach your issues with a scorched earth strategy, and maybe your minimalist over-compensation decompression strategies are just some form of expression of your need to change the issue : your material environment which symbolizes your lifestyle. \n\nYou don't have to stop studying. You don't have to take drastic measures all the time to fix an issue. What you need is moderation, and moderation for you might be to join a community college, or a trade school, or only go to school part time, or decide to leave and start a business, or become an artist, or a gardener. It may also mean moving from the stress of the city, into a small country town, it might mean traveling or backpacking, wherever you feel like going.   \n\n\nMy point being, stop trying to fix what's not broken. Change everything else about your life, before you think about changing you. Don't do that. Take good care my friend, and moreover, don't, and listen to me on this, don't entertain your greedy parents dreams and ambitions for you anymore. They will rob you of your whole life, just like their health measures towards you resembled the disciplinary actions of war criminals, and they robbed you of your unaltered, natural neurological framework.   \n\n\nFair winds, my friend. You are still young, and can still undo a lot of the damage, but only if you start making decisions your yourself, and yourself only. Remove the thought of your parents from your decisions that affect your life. And follow YOUR dreams.",

The concept of perspective, especially when it pertains to understanding not only point of view, but also narrative in general is essential.   \nBill Hicks, in his dry anti-humor take on consciousness, attempted to describe this sort of epiphany, which he may attribute to the use of psychedelic drugs : \n\n*\u201cToday a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one* ***consciousness***  *experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life  is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom  with the weather.\u201d*  \n\n\nWell, it is all good and fine to come across this satori, at some point in life, that there may be what can be described as a collective consciousness, exploring itself from within, via varying subjective point of views, our selves. But how does that translate into material reality itself? How can we make this piece of wisdom matter, and how can it help us make sense of our social interactions, our relationships with each other as human being? \n\nMy intent with this post is to provide some general advice, which can be easily understood, and genuinely performed, with the interest of providing a platform for relationships to grow. As such, perhaps in tune with the choice of a TV segment skit from Bill's comedy show, I chose to approach the question from a theatrical standpoint and provide some pointers.   \n\n\nIn the great tragedy (or farce), that is life, we are subject to two forces, both internal and external which condition and influence our choices. We can either choose our character, or be forced into a type cast by prejudice, or forced traits of our character. But understanding that in our daily lives, we do not get to watch the full movie of everyone else's day, or existence is a first point of entry into this challenge.   \n\n\nBeing able to recognize the roles you may be able to play, will greatly benefit you in life as it will help grow your relationships and develop your sense of self further. Think of it as if it were an actor's repertoire. They may take an interest in comedies, and rely heavily on humor, and uplifting story-telling in their life. Or they may be more so interested in taking upon the dramatic acts, ones that dive deep into ranges of emotions, of moral questionings, intellectual research.   \n\n\nThe key here is to start to understand that throughout your life, people will ask you ''to play a part'', and learning to identify the role, its attributes, qualities or faults will help you understand whether it is one that you deem appropriate for yourself. Which leads me into the biggest takeaway from this lifestyle approach and general philosophy of theatrical performance :   \n\n\nMost of the time, you will not be the leading act. And that is fine, and you should understand that there are as many stories to tell as there are people. But you can choose to make the active choice, to take upon a part into someone else's life that will be beneficial.   \nInstead, choose to be the supporting character who comes in at a time of trouble to lift someone from their darkness, or offer them some help and practical solutions. Or for people whom you may have an extended relationship with, still building, you can view yourself as a guest star, who is invited in, and asked to show up to deliver a very specific dynamic of friendship and interest for a little while. \n\nAll relationships are transactional, and we do not have the time for most of them. So, be fine with the fact that most of the time, you will probably only be a vague, evanescent cameo in the crowd of actors, all which hold various roles in their life or acting career, only one of which as lead, and that is why you should not try to take that role away from them.   \n\n\nIf you have a keen interest for theatrics, performing arts or cinema, I think this paradigm will come in handy, and learning to assimilate a few specific concept such as role identification, table reads, and the dynamics of performance and relationships when it comes to the structure of a play/movie. \n\nIn other words, you will get to be a hero. You will also be able to come through with the support. You will show up only briefly sometimes. Maybe as comic relief. Maybe a few romantic story arcs. Some drama, some laughs, some tears. Your goal is not to win the best lead role. You only win this one once, and it's a given. Your goal is/should be to win the best supporting characters awards in all the sections of your life. Knowing how you fit into the great scene of life may very well get you far in life. Maybe not Hollywood, but somewhere.   \n\n\nNext time you meet or interact with a stranger, do not ask yourself how can I make my self seem confident, or smart, or funny or well adjusted socially? Ask yourself, how can I not steal the scene, yet create just enough intrigue that we start to build some rapport. \n\nThanks for reading. Hope this approach helps bring a fresh take on social dynamics and relationships.\n\n[https://youtu.be/U3tyB-y\\_z8w?t=229](https://youtu.be/U3tyB-y_z8w?t=229)"

Whether it's the advancements of neuroscience or the leaps we're making in terms of aging reversal, and virtual immortality (by sickness), or it's the fact soon enough cybernetic enhancements akin to the Neuralink will be rolling out on a commercial level and paving the way for full digitalization or should I say abstraction of our selves.   \nThen will come all shapes and forms of imaginative creation, pro-creation in the sense that we will be able to re-invent pretty much everything in a controlled environment - the wheel, fire, you name it. Even ourselves - choose your avatar.   \n\n\n  \nNaturally, it won't happen today or even tomorrow  - although as we begin to make progress the concept of time will seem exponentially futile as regarding anti-aging in the field of genetics, we're on the cusp of commercialization (plenty of trials, studies and research already successfully conducted).   \nBut it begs some practical questions. For those of us here who can hope to ''make the cut'', as in live long enough to see this technology snatch them out eternally from the claws of death...  \nSee, time begins to blur fairly quick here because if we manage that, and if our super-intelligent AIs finally allow us to make that breach into the final frontier, the full neural barrier mapping, then virtually anyone, anybody from the past of whom we'd have any semblance of genetic markers, whether DNA or physical brain matter...We could bring it all back. Everyone. Still, in a controlled environment, a digital playground if you will, the big sandbox...  \nAnd who's to say we're not already there? There's the multi-verse aspect of string theory that imputes we may be effortlessly gliding from reality to reality, into different dimensions forever continuating the electrical surge that is life, as its vessel and so the loop must be looped, and we will return to mere electrical current. A beautiful synesthetic explosion of colors, sounds, sensations which our perception loosely interprets into material prehension, into physical principles by which we guide the pursuit of life, the finding of a path of least resistance...  \n\n\n  \nBriefly, my questions...They would perhaps best suit the mind of a Ti-Se or Ti-Ne thinker, although Ni-Te might capture the idea in essence - is about the practical resolutions you would have towards envisioning such a mind space - a space within the mind, a continuum from within and without...  \nI want to know what the tinkerers, the mechanics, the engineers would make of such a think. Architects welcome.   \nTo give in broad strokes what the literary field of science-fiction has already presented, premonitions or self-fulling prophecies which tie in with the human tribulation that is the notion of predestination, and free will... I suppose, my question is, to the mad scientists, the space cowboys, the absurdists and surrealists...Par the obvious space suits, and lab coats, par the cybernetic enhancements, the boredom of immortals that drive them to toy around in a myriad of refractions, with endless simulations, definitions, re-/de-fragmentations...What would you do?"

I do relate some to INTP but don't know how that would fit in with the profile description or how I was as a kid. I generally talked a lot and was the leader of my friend group. I also teased people especially as I got to be 17-18 (man that was long ago)! \n\nThanks for your thoughts!",

I edited out my name and changed it to the word \"subject.\"\n\n(Disclaimer: long post)\n\nSubject may lose interest in a project once the challenge ceases. He may then be ready for another challenging project. He embraces visions not always seen by others. Subject's creative mind allows him to see the \"big picture.\" He is extremely results-oriented, with a sense of urgency to complete projects quickly. He likes to be forceful and direct when dealing with others. His desire for results is readily apparent to the people with whom he works. Subject prefers an environment with variety and change. He is at his best when many projects are underway at once. He prefers being a team player, and wants each player to contribute along with him. He needs to learn to relax and pace himself. He may expend too much energy trying to control himself and others. He can be aggressive and direct, but still be considerate of people. Other people realize that directness is one of his great strengths. Many people see him as a self-starter dedicated to achieving results. He is forward-looking, aggressive and competitive. His vision for results is one of his positive strengths. \n\nSubject has the ability to make high-risk decisions, but sometimes should seek counsel before acting. He is a good problem solver and troubleshooter, always seeking new ways to solve old problems. He finds it easy to share his opinions on solving work-related problems. He has the unique ability of tackling tough problems and following them through to a satisfactory conclusion. Sometimes he becomes emotionally involved in the decision-making process. Sometimes he may be so opinionated about a particular problem that he has difficulty letting others participate in the process. When faced with a tough decision, he will try to sell you on his ideas. He will work long hours until a tough problem is solved. After it is solved, he may become bored with any routine work that follows. \n\nSubject tends to be intolerant of people who seem ambiguous or think too slowly. He may sometimes mask his feelings in friendly terms. If pressured, his true feelings may emerge. He challenges people who volunteer their opinions. He should exhibit more patience and ask questions to make sure that others have understood what he has said. Subject tends to influence people by being direct, friendly and results-oriented. He may lose interest in what others are saying if they ramble or don't speak to the point. His active mind is already moving ahead. He likes people who give him options as compared to their opinions. The options may help him make decisions, and he values his own opinion over that of others! His creative and active mind may hinder his ability to communicate to others effectively. He may present the information in a form that cannot be easily understood by some people."

It contains some triggering experiences referring to near-death experience and some abuse, but nothing in detail.   \n\n\nAlso, I mention my parent who was abusive and BPD. Please know that I do not believe those with BPD are automatically bad or abusive people -- it is relevant to my situation that the parent I discuss has BPD.  \n\n\nI'm posting it here because we are hoping to get the perspective of other people with DID. Thanks!\n\n\\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was hoping to discuss peoples' experiences here on growing up with constant psychological and/or physical abuse and the relation that has to health issues including allergies.\n\n!!!!!!\n\nTW for mention of death and scary health stuff:\n\n!!!!!!!\n\nSo a VERY shortened version of my personal experience, with a lot left out:\n\nI grew up with a BPD parent (diagnosed in their early 40s, has since rejected the diagnosis for a dx of Intermittent Explosive Disorder) Over the last ten years, my health took a turn and at one point I really thought things were wrapping up and I wasn't going to be around much longer. I hadn't realized I was living with a dissociative disorder and had somehow (with no clear memory) ended up living with my dBPD parent again, at 30 years old, after having thought I moved away for good.\n\nDuring this time, my health was already pretty poor. I've had chronic migraines since I was about 7, as well as asthma. As a young adult, I was dx'd with Celiac disease and had a hard time managing it properly due to lack of education (I did not know about separate kitchenware, cross-contaminated foods, etc.). In my mid-20s during a highly stressful time living with dBPD parent, I started developing sores all over my body that wouldn't heal. I was accused of self-inflicting, even by a dr. The sores continued for years -- hundreds and hundreds at a time. My body became inflamed all over, I was losing hair, lost my eyelashes and eyebrows (eyebrows never came back). Later down the line, I began having seizures and was accused of faking and only treated for psychological issues which did not help and honestly I got worse. Long story short, after having moved away from dBPD mom several times, I ended up back with her and one night I had the worst seizure of my life. It was close to a night she had a major rage episode that involved animal abuse and I was forced to care for the animal through a migraine I should have been in the ER for. Anyway, during the seizure I think I had a near death experience and when it ended I vomited worse than I ever had in my life. From that point on, I began vomiting every time I ate and had blood in my stool. Over the next 2 years, I woke up having (I did not know what it was then) anaphylactic shock every single night, seizing and vomiting with diarrhea and sure I was going to die. The only thing I did not have was trouble breathing -- no swelling, or hives. But my blood pressure would drop so low I would nearly pass out. I lost over 90lbs and dBPD mom went between caring for me and verbally/emotionally abusing me pretty rapidly. I was very stressed and afraid. She would make me come to restaurants with her to keep her company, but I was unable to eat. After some time and FINALLY getting medical care (I truly was too far gone to help myself) it was discovered I was having food allergies. I started from scratch eating rice and chicken, and discovered I'd become allergic to many, many common foods, from corn and all its derivatives, to sugar, most fruits and vegetables, fermented foods, and the list goes on. To this day, I am living somewhere safe and am receiving therapy for trauma, but my diet is limited to just a few foods. There are certain stores I can't go in to because my throat swells, and I still get migraines that come in cycles. I have worked so much on self care, relaxation techniques, am doing EMDR, and have made so many improvements but these allergies persist. Between allergic reactions, migraines and chronic fatigue syndrome I am unable to work. I even had to have Benadryl compounded, because Benadryl tablets (and generics) have corn in them.\n\nI am honestly shocked and humbled to still be alive. I feel like there are many times I should not have made it, and I don't know how I lived through the things my body has experienced. The stress and abuse my dBPD parent put me through is blocked from my memory about half of the time, I just know that it was horrific and the drastic change between her rage and abuse, to being my \"friend\" and buying gifts, lovebombing etc was too much for me to handle. She could go from chasing me trying to scratch my face and wailing like a banshee (I can't watch The Shining because Jack Nicholson in that movie reminds me of her) to bringing me home gifts of things I genuinely love, and taking me to Disney World. I am working so hard to heal but the abuse I grew up in truly had destroyed my psyche and I'm just starting to see the connection to the abuse and my physical health. Most doctors don't even want to deal with me. The illness isn't psychosomatic, but I do think it was triggered by the stress of abuse.\n\n!!!!\n\nSo, does anyone want to share their experience/vent at all, or have any insight? Might there be other things I could do to help my body heal? Even when I feel more relaxed than I've ever felt in my life, my body is on high alert.\n\nThanks for giving me a safe place to share and thanks if you read this far!"

I\u2019ve been dealing with stomach issues- particularly constipation for the past couple years.

I was annoyed at this because body image has never played a role in my eating habits- it doesn\u2019t seem to be a good explanation from a mental/emotional standpoint, but perhaps I wasn\u2019t consuming enough calories and think I could have an eating disorder. Often when I\u2019m on my own at college I won\u2019t feel motivated to eat until like 5 PM and sometimes have only 1-2 meals a day. My dad has said before sometimes it seems like I\u2019m too lazy to eat. However I\u2019m really not a picky eater and am adventurous in trying new foods, however what I feed myself can be a bit samey, sometimes I go through food fixations of only eating certain foods which I heard is common with ADHD folks. For example, my breakfast always contains either a bagel with cream cheese, toast and eggs, or yogurt and I don\u2019t really deviate from that. I\u2019ve always been a slower eater than the rest of my family and don\u2019t like the feeling of being full as it\u2019s uncomfortable.\n\nMy question is could these habits be ARFID or would it be better explained by a different eating disorder or simply ADD brain? Most posts I see here are people who are extremely picky eaters to the point it interferes socially which is not my case."

I was in love at the time and was super excited about my life and it ended up being an amazing trip. Saw god, total euphoria, etc\n\nSince I\u2019ve done shrooms a couple times, once with my ex - was a strong trip but not entirely good, experienced ego death. the weather was iffy and we were basically stuck in a hotel room during it. his vibes were throwing me off too tbh. I\u2019ve found weather/setting to have a huge impact on psychedelics.\n\nBeing older now I don\u2019t know the best setting to trip alone. I would be worried about being alone in public/nature especially as a woman tripping- even in a beautiful spot. I find it easier to act normal on acid in public for some reason, shrooms are more disorienting.\n\nMy last acid trip over a month ago was with one of my best friends and a sober trip sitter and it ended up being life changing. I was apprehensive going in being on a long break from psychs and scared to lose control. But it was such a good reset on toxic mental patterns I had fallen into.\n\nIs tripping at home in your room for example, even a good idea? Worked well for me a couple years ago but the setting was entirely different. I feel like with good music and reflection it could still be great, but maybe I should just wait to do it with someone I\u2019m close to (I have shrooms I\u2019m just waiting to use atm). I\u2019m not worried about losing my shit or anything but just general vibes. I\u2019m pretty introverted and enjoy being alone but psychedelics are by nature unpredictable and idk how the setting would affect it. My goal is spiritual and self development. Looking for any guidance on this!\n\nThank you <3"

If you look 'felting' or 'shrinking' on this sub you will find some.\n\nThe best advice I can think of is the same as others, keep up your machine experiments with swatches and see which fibers create your desired outcome.\n\nAlso if you can wash by hand, it's far less time consuming than it seems. Knit also won't need as much washing if you have layer under it, this will impact how it keeps you warm, but only a little. Handwashing knit can be fairly fast, but it is heavy so it's definitely challenging and may not be possible for everyone.",

The reason knitted wool garments are warm is because the fibers aren't dence. The  spaces around fibers allow air to be trapped and this warms up next to the body. The warm air trapped in the yarn is what keep you warm. Highly felted fabric will not do this as effectively as tightly knit fabric. Of course looser knit with larger gaps will cause cold wind to blow in, while tighter knits will not. \n\nTight and dence knitting but not dence and compact fiber is a good combination of keeping cold air out and warm air in.\n\n\nduh.",

I've spent most of my time in large enterprise companies that have questionable software architecture practices and had mostly used CRUD and SQL for everything and are not, for the most part, open to changes.\n\nWhen I started my career as a architect (pretty much full-stack one person IT department), for a big-ish company with a business that pretty much do write-heavy (8-10k events per minute) transactions. I initially tried to do a monolith with a single SQL database instance, that of course failed the performance requirements, and decided to take out the write-heavy parts into their own services.\n\nAnyway, I went and took the plunge and did event sourcing (scoped by domain and with DDD), because clients never know how they want to see their data, and projections are trivial ~~when you have all the events you have~~ when you can just replay the events to rebuild them.\n\nWhile there was a lot of boilerplate involved, development was fairly simple and straight-forward. I was thoroughly impressed by the flexibility that it gives me, the performance has been great, and the event log has been a great way to cover my a\\*\\* whenever the client thinks something's wrong with the system.\n\nNeedless to say, event sourcing has become my golden hammer and any and all business requirements are the nail. Built-in audit logs, easily unit-testable, projections are pretty much disposable, and the list of pros just keep going.\n\nI can't shake the feeling though that I'm digging myself into a hole, and I'm looking for guidance as a fairly new architect.\n\nAnyway, on to the question: Whenever people talk about event sourcing, some (seemingly more experienced) people tend to say that event sourcing does not fit or is overkill for some domains. Are there really domains where event sourcing would just not fit?"

I use an XPS15 7590 (the 2019 one) with a GTX1650 that I use mostly for work (VMs, webservices, and Android development) with some gaming here and there (no FPS games and mostly MHWorld, HZD, Final Fantasy, etc) and get decent FPS with a few undervolting and optimizations here and there.\n\nI thought about getting a 1440p monitor, specifically the ViewSonic XG270QG, and was wondering if my machine can handle it - I don't mind having to go 1080p (med-high) or 1440p low settings for now until I can finally properly build a PC.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: grammar and spelling\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks for the responses guys! I'll mark this question answered now."

I hope my experience, is just one example of the acceptance that the next generation will be met with, as they find themselves and their own sexual orientation. \n\nI am so glad I told her about my bisexuality, and I am so happy that she is without self-judgment. Times are changing \ud83d\ude0a"

I stupidly thought I could just use water and cranberry juice to flush out my system. I had a foul smell urinating, I had the constant feeling to urinate with little coming out, and overall discomfort. I also had some vaginal discharge 2-3 times that was white and creamy. When I went in to the clinic, they checked to see if I have a UTI and found nothing so they looked internally and I had only a small amount of yeast. I was given an anti-fungal and on my way\n\n\nIts been a few days and while things have gotten better, if I urinate, especially in the morning (I wake up around 400am to urinate) it still has a foul smell and suddenly there's a pressure on my bladder as though I have a full bladder which makes everything incredibly uncomfortable and hard to go back to sleep because im not in any pain but its constant pressure that won't go away and when I go to urinate, only a small amount comes out. This feeling goes away when I have been drinking fluids. I just want this to go away but im not sure what it could be if they saw no UTI in my urine before. There's no longer any sort of discharge\n\nAny suggestions? I'm pretty miserable"

If you\u2019re driving 60mph for 1 hr 15 min and then 15-25mph for 45min in a traffic heavy city, that\u2019s going to drop your mph but you wouldn\u2019t conclude they were just driving slow if the majority of those miles were on an parkway. You want to look for the mode of mph (all other factors constant) not the average to see if speed played a role in mpg.\n\nAlso the driving conditions of your trip are drastically different from the trip I made, you can\u2019t compare the 2 to get a good idea if wind resistance or speed was the determining factor in mpg. Those play in mpg absolutely but I wouldn\u2019t conclude wind/speed to be the factor in the differences between our trip\u2019s mpg, you had way more obstacles to trudge thru. But I\u2019ll go a step further and say even higher speed could leverage more mpg. It all depends on the distance being and how much gas is required to make that distance. \n\nThese vehicles are great at gas when it comes to speed and long distance travel but in shorter trips (distance wise) it greatly lags.",

It doesn't open, it doesn't read games, and it doesn't spin, the eject light doesn't even flash like how it normally does when opening. They replaced it with another drive and that worked so the problem is with my dvd drive, I even swapped it with my Thompson and that works so it's definitely the phillips drive that has some sort of issue.\n\nWhen I opened it up, everything looked normal, no dust, the belt is looking good, the lense is clean, no apparent cracks. When I power on my xbox, the drive just does nothing, like no power is being fed to it. If anyone has any ideas on how to solve this please let me know.  \n\nI'm going to buy a replacement phillips drive in about month but in the meantime I want to try to fix this before I replace it."

But it really does come down to you and how you feel about it (as long as it\u2019s legal)\n\nThe lies get messy, and the truth will come out at some point so it\u2019s really up to you for how much control you have over it. You can either purposefully tell the people you want to know and have a conversation about it or let it slip out and have a less pleasant version of said conversation because you weren\u2019t ready to talk about it yet\n\nNow to the actual age. It\u2019s about as big of a concern as you make it. Like I said, people will say what they want and they will always say what they want (tbf there are sick people out there but I digress) but it\u2019s really up to you if you care about what people say\n\nAnyways good luck :3 be open and honest and willing to have a conversation and yada yada",

Very discouraged now and don\u2019t know who to talk to :/ \n\nFor a lot of context, my store just finished a remodel and hasn\u2019t been in the best of shape since, but we\u2019ve also been low staffed as well. So today when we actually manage to have 5 people in style, my team lead changed what our zones were and wanted me to hard zone men\u2019s all on my own. \n\nI\u2019m generally curious how long it\u2019s supposed to take to hard zone a whole area because I\u2019m relatively new (been working here for two months) so when my team lead said it would be a challenge but shouldn\u2019t take that long I believed her (she isn\u2019t a style team lead and came from up front so I don\u2019t know how much knowledge she has)\n\nBecause of my schedule, I and my other style members get in at 5pm, process and push, then zone at 6. So from that time to close I would theoretically have 4 hours to get it done (5 if I include the time we stay past close) however, we still have to take breaks, cover breaks for Ulta, as well as our team lead taking 45 minutes out of all of styles time to show us how to hard zone and merchandise\u2026 which is something we already know how to do. \n\nSo, realistically, I only had around 3 hours total to do anything in my zone. I spent about 1 hour and 30 minutes on hard zoning only 5 or so 4 foot sections of the jean wall and when my team lead comes by to say that it shouldn\u2019t have taken me that long to do so was very disheartening. Not only that but I tried to tell her that I didn\u2019t think I would be able to get a hard zone in on the area but could at least get a zone done, she said that the hard zone had to be done and that I need to speed up my process. \n\nSo all of this to say I felt pretty bad after not being able to meet my team leads expectations but also being dismissed about not being able to do a hard zone. I felt like her expectations were way too high for what could\u2019ve been done and wanted to talk to someone about it that would listen in my store or could do something"

I had always chalked it up to a bad Grindr hookup. \n\nI was 18 or 19 at the time and finally mustered the courage to embrace my gayness and go do gay things. But even though I was 18/19 I was a helpless romantic and only ever wanted to do cute things that involved other guys instead of sex lol\n\nSo I find this guy who I thought was cute. We talk for a bit and I\u2019m eventually invited over after saying I really enjoy cuddling for how cute it is. When I arrive at his place, we lay down and do exactly that. We cuddle for a bit watching something and then he tries to make a move to which I promptly say no, and then he stops\n\nWe wound up turning off the tv and go to sleep. After I\u2019ve fallen asleep, I\u2019m woken up by him making another advance, trying to touch me. I, being very innocent and naive, didn\u2019t want to be touched because I didn\u2019t want sex and just wanted to cuddle\n\nAll he said was \u201cc\u2019mon\u201d, proceeded to take my pants off and then blow me. I had no idea what to do and lay there frozen. And that was it. I don\u2019t remember if I finished or not. It\u2019s not exactly important at this point. But what I do remember is offering the same to him afterwards because that\u2019s how I thought it was supposed to work (me being very na\u00efve)\n\nSo that\u2019s the story of that. Everything past this is just my commentary of the event (as if it\u2019s not my own history lol)\n\nI thought about that night some. But it was never in horror or anything like that. It was just one of my passing memories of that whole relationship that was a major shit show. (I was very emotionally immature and had no idea what I was doing) ^(probs daddy issues lol)\n\nIt all happened so fast that I didn\u2019t even realize what position I was in until long after it had happened. I could press charges or whatever if I really wanted to but I feel at this point, I personally just don\u2019t care enough. That whole segment of my life is one I would rather forget and leave behind because I\u2019m in a MUCH better place now. But I still wonder how bad it had messed me up (not the rape specifically but everything else following including the rape)\n\nBut anyways, thanks for anyone who made it this far :) I\u2019m wondering if anyone else\u2019s story felt this way"

I do understand that not rarely does depression stem from boredom, but I don't think it's any hard to find cases where the depression is rooted in genuinely shitty life situations. To play along with Camus, sometimes the question is \"Should you wake up to bear the incessant yelling and beating of your father, then go to a college which you have no friend nor interest in because your family cannot afford a better college, then work extra to afford meds because your dad refuses to believe in the existence of mental illness, then come home and take care of your 2 little sisters who are too young to tend to themselves, or should you just shoot yourself in the head?\" (it sounds like fiction, but this is the situation that my current GF is living through right now). Sometimes, what brings people to the choice of death is not just one single choice, but a series of long-lasting conditions that both render one's attempt to change futile and diminish one's expectation (\"If there really are both good and bad, then why has life only given them the bad so far?\"). To these people, \"experience is at least marginally more interesting than not being at all\" is a rather unsympathetic sentiment, and even more so is the idea that their choice of death is somehow a \"lazy\" one. People's bravery can only extend so far sometimes.\n\n(I do note, however, that there indeed are also people choosing between a cup of coffee and a gunshot to the head, and for them the advice to break out of their shells works wonderfully. I do also note that changing the word \"lazy\" to \"inadequately imaginative\" would fix the issue: people can remain continually blind from a better future despite their hard work.)\n\nThe problem for us external observers (a very privileged position if you ask me), then, is to show them that there's value in living despite their ample knowledge of their own lives telling them no experience at all is better than endless suffering. That, or guiding them to search in a direction they've never look at before. But that surely is not an easy task, and so the issue of life and death for these people remains far more complicated than just \"sticking around to see anything interesting\".",

However, all the sources that I've found so far focus on the new structural definition of oppression and I couldn't find any source on earlier conceptions of oppression, so I would appreciate it if somebody can show me some works about them.\n\nOr perhaps there really was very little literature about these earlier conceptions of oppression, and I'm better off theorizing about that myself? Or should this be the direction of my essay at all? Answers to these questions are also appreciated.\n\nAny works that shine some light on Young's ideas about oppression (including criticism against them) in general are welcomed as well."

She cries over her letters from home in a way you'd think she was Jenna Lewis. When left unattended, she sinks Burton and Jon.\n\nAnd despite all of that, she makes it to the end, having put every member of the jury where they are.\n\nEvery episode, you should be asking yourself \"What will Lill do?\" because what Lill *does* is control the post-merge, mope all the way to day 39, and then decides that Sandra should win because the million would all go right up Fairplay's nose.\n\n\"Don't make me out as a bitch, just make me out as a dumb broad.\" -Lill"

And I don't know which of the artist's other works to look for either.\n\nAll I remember was that this Kaguya fandub was highly impressive. It sort of sounded as though Kaguya's Japanese VA had managed to pick up fluent English then just decided they would be casted for the anime's English dub as well, and I thought it was an underrated masterpiece. \n\nSadly, as far as I remember, there eventually came a note stating that this fandub piece was copyright-striked by Funimation.\n\nTo further specify, the dubbed scene of this piece was a short clip from the first season. I can't remember which specific scene, but I do remember the artist deciding to keep Miyuki's Japanese voice in the clip and then patching their own voiced English lines over Kaguya's original dialouge. \n\nAnd I also vaguely remember their video description going like \"I decided to try out some small thing because I was bored\" or something like that. It basically appeared as though they were being fairly humble about the piece.\n\nCould anyone send a copy of this missing fandub if you know which I'm referring to? Or at least identify the artist who made it? \n\nAny detective help would be appreciated, thanks. :-)"

It's even at the point where I have something else to look forward to every week.\n\nEnjoyable, yet I can't help but feel that there's some huge element being overlooked at certain parts.\n\nEither the intent is to deviate the humor from deadpan to \"goofier and more straightforward,\" or that just happens to be the way they're generally going about it. \n\nYou could think of it as more a matter of how open you are to change than the quality in and of itself, but even so.

I could play some of my fav songs ever (Everlong, Where is my mind ecc...)\nHowever, last October I slowly stopped playing and ended up not picking my guitar in months at all, so far.\n\nI believe that's because I wasn't able to get a steady routine of practicing/playing anymore and I didn't know what to practice anymore. I'd like to learn how to improvise, and I'd love playing solos. Recently I've also started being interested R&B/jazz guitar, but rlly don't know where to start.\nBefore quitting I've had started following Justin guitar intermediate course, but i really wasn't interested in that anymore, probably because I wasn't learning how to play what I really wanted to.\n\nSo, this is my story lol.\n\n\nDo you have any idea what the right place to start again could be? Has any of guys ever been in the same situation as mine?\nDo you know any interesting practice routines I should try/or specific YouTube channels/free courses where I could start learning again? Any advice of any type?"

Yes, her birth name is Nimrata, but Nikki is a common pet name that means \u2018dear one\u2019, and it\u2019s common in India to be given a pet name like that, that sticks with you for life. \n\nMy own mother\u2019s birth name and subsequent pet name is very similar to the Nimrata/Nikki situation and it drives her stark raving mad when these condescending Westerners see \u201cNimrata\u201d on her government paperwork and assume that \u201cNikki\u201d is anglicized for their benefit. In the past few years it\u2019s gotten worse for people like my Mom and other family friends, with people finding out their original name and insisting on using it, even though the only people who call her Nimrata are her doctor and the customs officer at the airport! My Mom\u2019s own high school diploma from her birth country lists Nikki because that\u2019s what all her teachers and classmates knew her by. \n\nEspecially in South Asian culture where your first name and surname can be 4 syllables each, people don\u2019t go around using all four syllables all the time, it\u2019s commonly shortened to a nickname that is 1-2 syllables. Not for anglicization! Just because ain\u2019t nobody got time for all those syllables. One of my uncles was called Sandy, in their personal life and professional life and I never questioned it for years, until I asked and found out that he was given that nickname in primary school because his initials were SND, and the name stuck. He does international business work across Asia and Europe but goes by \u201cSandy\u201d because his 8-year old Indian classmates thought it suited him!!! It wasn\u2019t a career thing. It was his childhood nickname. He gets annoyed when people use his real first name, because he\u2019s never ever gone by it. \n\nYou get introduced to people at parties by their two syllable nickname and may not find out their birth name until years later!!! And I feel like constantly calling out these Nimrata/Nikki instances in public figures of South Asian heritage and ignorantly boxing all of them together as whitewashing is arrogantly egocentric! Not everything is for YOUR benefit! This type of thing is totally normal in South Asian culture, and the people that get riled up about the supposed cultural whitewashing are the ignorant Westerners!",

Buddhist monks sexually assaulting women and children and getting away with it, guilting people into giving them money then spending it on luxuries the general population can\u2019t afford and that true Buddhists would actually avoid entirely, the whole idea that you can atone for bad behavior by donating thousands to the temple instead of apologizing or asking forgiveness from the person you wronged. \n\nIt\u2019s so interesting for me to hear these discussions about the faults of Christianity because they all come from a very American point of view, and Americans sometimes put Eastern cultures on a pedestal. Although I\u2019m a Christian living in America now, most of my Christian community isn\u2019t from Southern USA Bible Belt, they have similar stories where their parents or grandparents were part of an Eastern religion ex. Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim etc. and got fed up of hypocrisy so they became Christians. \n\nMost religions sound great in theory, but in practice, the Eastern religions manifest in the exact same faults that the Western ones do, but the grass is always greener on the other side.",

Right now it\u2019s Perok, it used peanut butter, before that it was lemon bars, next month it will probably be something else.\n\nIt is understandable that people want to share their successes, and encourage each other! How wonderful! This is a lovely wholesome community that will help YOU make a Perok your Armenian mother in law would be proud of!!! \n\nBut as hard as it may be for some to believe, not everyone likes to scroll through dozens of pictures of Perok/lemon bars/insert fad here to get to more original content. It clogs up our feeds, and can get downright frustrating when you have to scroll through 7 Perok pictures to get to one original recipe.\n\nLuckily... there is a way to appease both sides. If we were to create a stickied post that highlighted the most trending recipe of that time, people could share their attempts and alterations to their Perok recipe without clogging  the feed and overstimulating everyone else who may not be a fan of Perok.\n\nThen when the Perok fad dies down, and is replaced by something else... just change the stickied post to highlight the NEW trending recipe. That way, everyone who wants to jump on the bandwagon can eagerly do so, get their fill of it, and anyone else who isn\u2019t interested, can more easily find new content.\n\nA happy medium is possible! It wouldn\u2019t take much effort and it would certainly make things better for everyone no matter which side of the Perok debate you\u2019re on. \n\nSimply scrolling through, and relying on individuals to add more original content to dilute the Perok, isn\u2019t a reasonable solution. There\u2019s been a toxic mindset toward discussion on this topic, and people have admitted to posting EVEN MORE Perok purely because they know it annoys other members of the community. This sort of behavior should never be tolerated, and is absolutely NOT the kind of wholesomeness that this sub strives for. Most people have responsibilities that take time away from their goal to become the next Martha Stewart and they reasonably just could not find enough old recipes to overpower the current fad. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of the Perok! The lemon bar huns cannot be stopped so easily!\n\nAll humor aside, I really think this is a suggestion in everyone\u2019s best interests, and hope it will be taken seriously. I would also remind critics that I am using the \u201cdiscussion\u201d post flair so this kind of post and other text-only posts are perfectly appropriate. \n\nHave a wonderful day and happy cooking!\n\nEdit: Just because it\u2019s an issue that you don\u2019t have a problem with, doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not an issue worth addressing. I can\u2019t believe the amount of Karens going... \u201cWell I\u2019m fine with it, so everyone else should be too\u201d quite honestly that level of entitlement isn\u2019t acceptable past kindergarten. Let\u2019s learn to take a moment to understand other people\u2019s perspectives and make everyone feel heard.\n\nEdit 2: Ok, people are feeling triggered by my use of the word \u201cKaren\u201d in my first edit, and also feel that people aren\u2019t really diminishing the anti-Perok crowd, which would imply that this is blown out of proportion. I feel that the current 400+ upvotes this post has received in less than 8 hrs is worth noting, so I feel that there must be truth in what I\u2019m pointing out. \n\nAlso, if I delete the previous edit people will think I\u2019m trying to hide it. So instead, here\u2019s an additional edit to apologize if anyone felt attacked by the terminology I\u2019ve used. I\u2019ve responded earlier in the comments that I would post links to threads, but I also don\u2019t want to call out individuals specifically cause that\u2019s not cool by any standard, so I\u2019m stuck. However I will also note that I\u2019m not just referring to this particular thread but also the the one by u/elcarnioo where you can read the comments for yourself, as I have, and then scroll through the thread and find that the majority of comments seek to diminish the OP\u2019s frustrations by deeming this subject a non-issue, almost blaming OP for it a la \u201cWell if you posted more the Perok wouldn\u2019t be an issue\u201d like its their personal fault there isn\u2019t more diverse content on the subreddit. Adding smiley faces doesn\u2019t make it a kinder message, it just makes it appear passive aggressive. \n\nOnce again, I apologize for any divisiveness my diction has caused, but I do continue to maintain that cake is a legitimate issue on a subreddit for recipes, and one that should be taken seriously. \n\nLol I can\u2019t believe I literally had to write all that out. I\u2019m pretty sure people are just going to comment on how horrible this 2nd edit is..."

I got bullied at school and abused at home. The fact that I'd have 2h long breakdowns whenever someone would touch me, have ocd so I'd need to touch a door frame 600 times before entering a room, or the fact that I barely had any expressions or variety in my tone of voice (thus being described as a psychopath by my peers) wasn't helping my situation.\nBut I've always been better than everyone around me when It came to art, or any topic I'd get really interested in. While others would have to practice to achieve hyper realism, I just watched a 30 sec time-lapse video and knew how to do it.\n\nMy life has gotten a lot easier: I've won a lot of awards, started working before people my age, have one of the most known art accounts in my country, and my grades at university are perfect.\nI learned how to act so well, I became a natural. People actually want to be around me and see me as smart and charming.\n\nAlthough I can't help but feel terrible for my child self. And when I realised I have Autism, I felt such a relief. And even though I'm high functioning and getting a diagnosis wouldn't fix anything, I still feel like I owe it to myself, no matter how expensive getting diagnosed is.\n\nNow the rant part: whenever I try telling my family about this, I always get \"you're trying to play the victim; we used to get bullied too; the past is in the past; if you were really autistic, you wouldn't be this ahead in life; but I haven't seen you have these meltdowns so you must be lying etc\"\n\nI hate it I hate it I hate it. My sibling can get away with doing dumb things, but he's emotional and cuddly, so you aren't allowed to call him dumb. I do a slightly weird thing, and I'm an idiot with below average IQ. One moment I'm smarter than I give myself credit for, the next moment I get \"you're right, you really are idiotic\"\n\nNobody takes me seriously because I've always looked strong, both physically and personality wise. And don't get me wrong, I am. Although as much as I've gotten over and forgived, it's hard to forgive the way I was treated when I wasn't masking. And I feel like my child self is still getting bullied till this day.\n\nA diagnosis is expensive, and at the end of the day, it might get overlooked, so I don't know if it's worth It."

Already in the resolutions of the First Great Meeting of the OUN, held in 1929, it was stated that the Ukrainian state \"will stand in the position of full freedom of religious conscience\" and \"...cooperate with the Ukrainian clergy of various cults in matters of moral education of the nation.\"  This issue is especially clearly clarified in the Resolutions of the Fifth Conference of the OUN Central Committee, which state: \"The OUN competes for the ideal of Christian Ukraine, recognizes and defends the Christian worldview, which has been shaping Ukrainian spirituality for millennia.\"  Here we read: \"Ukrainian nationalist ideology stands on the idealistic worldview and is opposed to all materialistic trends.\"\n\n In the Resolutions of the Third Extraordinary Great Meeting of the OUN, clarified by the Conference of June 1950, anti-Christian movements are negatively evaluated: \"The OUN fights with all determination against international and fascist and national-socialist programs..., we are against Russian-Communist-Bolshevism.\"  So, here we are not talking about a passive attitude towards non-Christian and anti-Christian movements, but about the fight against their ideologies and programs.  In this way, Ukrainian nationalism also has features of militant Christianity.\"\n\n Ivan Gavdyda: \"Christianity and Ukrainian nationalism\";\n\nAlso Banderovites had democratic undertone unlike Ustasha, strong accent on it was especially placed after the war.",

Anything I'm wrong on or missing? How heavily should I allow Arch to influence my decision making? On paper it seems ideal, but this stuff is spooky and I don't want to make a hasty decision."

                "created_utc": 1667499787.0,
                "body": "This isn't a side-by-side comparison of the two apps. Tana is a little buggy and the learning curve is steeper than Roam, but I have nothing but positive things to say about its design. If I was on the Roam team, I'd be shitting my pants right now. Instead, this post is just my musings on PKM philosophy in general.\n\nIf Roam is meant to facilitate non-hierarchical thinking, Tana does it better. The idea behind Roam was that you could create everything from within the Daily Notes page, but in practice that amounted to throwing all of your thoughts into a bottomless pit of backlinks. Tana is superior in this regard because you can slap a few fields on any node (block) and then reliably retrieve that node using a live search. There's no reason to ever leave the daily notes page in Tana except to review your live searches.\n\nThe problem is that it turns out I actually like structure. A live search in Tana, or a list of backlinks, or a Roam query are all unsorted \"buckets\" of things. You can filter the results, but you can't rearrange or restructure them on the fly. One of my main workflows is reordering a list of tasks by hand, prioritizing them visually by moving more urgent tasks to the top. You could technically do this in Tana (or any PKM app for that matter) but it's antithetical to the Tana design philosophy. Live searches innately don't respect order. You could sort tasks by assigning a \"priority\" field and numerically ranking them, but that takes more work than dragging and dropping. \n\nIn Roam, I created elaborate project pages with multi-tiered nested hiearchies. What this structure cost me in upfront effort is more than made up for by the benefit of having a \"bird's eye view\" of a project. One quick glance at a project page tree and I know how it's structured. In Tana, you're meant to organically build structure from the bottom up, tagging nodes with relevant fields to ensure they get sent to the correct buckets. For example, instead of having \"Research\" and \"Development\" nodes and nesting appropriate content underneath, you would tag content with a \"Research\" field, and then a live search somewhere would automatically pull in that content. This seems faster, but then there's no tree representation of the project anywhere, so you have to figure out how you want to structure everything as you go along, rather than being (helpfully) constrained by existing structure.\n\nThe same people who are Daily Notes maximalists probably also like coding with command-line interfaces. Personally, I despise command lines. GUIs are fantastic inventions. A good user interface should offload the burden of memory from the user by visually representing the available options/commands in any given context. Sure, if you have memorized every single command in a program, a CLI is faster than a GUI, but modern software is too complex to memorize. By analogy, I want my PKM graph to visually represent the structure of knowledge, and to constrain my actions in a given context. You might be able to get the latter in Tana by tinkering with fixed field options, but the former is antithetical to its design philosophy.\n\nI was genuinely excited for Tana but I don't think it's the PKM app for me. Maybe Roam isn't ideal either, but the cost of switching apps isn't worth the fuss unless I find something substantially better. If you're a structured thinker like me, let me know what app you're using!"

Also he has a less problematic personality too: everybody likes the new bassist, James does, Dave does, Lars does, you do, I do.\n\n*Kill 'Em All is released! Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth) isn't there but we have an instrumental track with strong and thrashing drums and guitars.\n\n*The album is a hit! They tour US and Europe and Dave is pretty much the second frontman [who clearly considers himself *the* frontman]. Fame bring money and Dave grows into a worse and more violent drunk with an even worse drug addiction.\n\n*OK, Dave is a great guitarist, critics appreciate his skills, fans love his attitude, but noone will let this violent drunk take the spotlight anymore: Dave is fired after the tour. Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett replaces him.\n\n*Dave is FURIOUS. He immediately forms another band, and since he has a better head start than the real-life scenario, he can find a decent vocalist this time.\n\n*Meanwhile, Metallica start the recordings of RTL. Kirk brings Creeping Death and a lot of awesome solos with him. Great guy: everybody likes Kirk, James does, Lars does, the new bassist does, you do, I do.\n\n*Dave has formed the new band (I'll call it Megadave), has enough money and material but yeah: they spend most of the production money on drugs. Still can afford a better production for KIMB album.\n\n*Ride The Lightning is released! It has 4 songs credited to Dave. Kirk's influence is still visible though: especially in songs like \"Creeping Death\" and \"Trapped Under Ice\". There is an instrumental called \"When Hell Freezes Over\", which has credits to both Mustaine and Kirk. Bells isn't there, though.\n\n*Killing Is My Business is released! It's pretty much the KIMB with better production and better vocals. The album is well-received, due to the fact that it has great guitar work, a famous frontman, and an actual vocalist. It includes a stightly worse version of Ride The Lightning with different lyrics and a song that resembles the real-life Leper Messiah.\n\n*Both albums are hits! However Metallica is slightly better received while Megadave is labeled to be a Metallica rip-off.\n\nIn the distant future though:\n->Metallica ends up being a good thrash metal band, but never end up big enough. Their sound remains a bit more refined but without Cliff's touch, nothing is the same. Although since Cliff already wanted to leave Trauma, they could replace the new bassist with Cliff later on, which would end up them reaching their real-life success.\n->Megadave ends up being a good thrash metal band, but since the band leader is an excessively arrogant and violent drunk and addict who isn't the only frontman, there are a lot of line-up changes to be successful enough. Hell, Dave could even be kicked out of Megadave, and/or Megadave could dissolve. Or Megadave could become a less successful metal version of GnR under Axl (post-UYI period especially)",

While they wished to do what they really wanted to .

When you measure it, you **know** that it is either in a certain spot, or not in that spot. And logically if you **know** it is somewhere, it cant be anywhere else, so the superposition collapses\n\nThe double slit experiment is good for understanding this concept.

We move freely through 3 dimensions (with length and height) and in a straight path through one (time). A being with freedom over the 4th dimension would be able to move freely through it rather than being confined to a line like we are, and additionally would exist in all moments at once just as 3d space encompasses any 2d planes. And so on, with each higher dimension granting a new freedom of movement through space/time/reality\n\nI'm not going too into detail as you seem to have no interest.\n\nAnd you want to deal in facts, but if that were possible concerning religion we wouldn't need to be even having this discussion.

                "body": "I was previously trying to figure out which of the NP types I am, but after reading a bit more about Si I think I might actually be a sensor. Please help!  \n\n\nWhy I think I'm an Si user (I'm trying to be objective):\n\n* I have my own systems of doing things, and they are very specific systems based on what I think is logical. For example, in the board game Splendor I always place the gems in the order white, blue, green, red, black, because that's the order they always appear in on the cards (though not all gems are on all cards). I have my own systems for everything.\n* I use the past to predict the future. \n* I can sometimes remember details. I'm not a detailed oriented person, at all, but if something sticks out to me I can easily memorize it and bring it up again when needed.\n* I like to relive the past because I like to experience how something makes me feel (but this could just be because I'm starved for social situations)\n* I could have been lying to myself forever because I really, really, *really* don't want to be a sensor, especially an Si user (not that there's anything wrong with it, but it's the OPPOSITE of literally every trait I value in other people)\n* I like to know things in advance so I have time to mentally prepare, but I'm generally fine even if I don't  \n\n\nA general description of me:  \nI'm a philosophy, science and art person (I know, not what you'd expect from Si). I'm currently getting my associates degree in philosophy, and will turn ANY discussion into something philosophical. I'm bad at thinking of details (like if writing a story or similar), and am generally unaware of things happening around me. I sort of have a routine, but the second something is written out or planned I *cannot* follow it. I'm just not able to. I'm a social chameleon in the *most* sense of the phrase. But it never really feels like I'm changing myself around people, just certain traits of mine are brought out in different situations, like how colors can look different based on what other colors they're surrounded by. I usually appear either more analytical than I am, or completely and logically ridiculous (like using logic to make an illogical statement). I try to be funny but it's not my natural state; I take myself and everything seriously even though I don't want to. I also have the crazy Ne conversations, like about alien purple pumpkin seeds brought over by the dogs and lizards who are using them to take over the world, but only when with other people who are Ne users and can fuel my imagination. Or if I try really hard. I could just be in an Si loop or grip or whatever cause reasons lately. I also don't like to tell people how I feel. People call me weird very often (also unusual for Si users). I make my decisions based on a logical analysis of my feelings. So instead of just going by what I feel, I take a step back and weigh the options, and consider the impact on my feelings of either decision I make. I follow my own internal code, both of morals and black-and-white views of right and wrong (I'm working on not being so one sided, especially since I can see and understand the logics of both sides in any situation, I will just have strong feelings toward a single side regardless of the logic) and my own logical systems for how concepts are related and how I believe things should be done. My brain doesn't think laterally, instead jumping backwards and diagonally, going in circles and bringing up flashes of the past which are related to the future. Like, in my brain sometimes the sentences are out of correct word order, or they move backwards, or are directly related to something I'd just thought of but in a connection only I understand. It's like that for most of my systems, actually, they only make sense to me, but they make perfect sense. Like this meme thing:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4egyhzaecvd71.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d6355b3e50dd0b82911ef2d7d9b87e7b47fc3170\n\nSo what do you think?

I'm not sure this is the right place for this, so apologies in advance.\n\nMy exwife reached out after weeks of gaslighting and misdirection to ask me to agree to something while ignoring any and all requests I had asked of her in the interim. I answered no as the topic was decided over a month ago and her issues on that topic revolve around control of the situation. This lead to hours of back and forth in what can only be described as narcissistic rage on her part with personal attacks, victim card playing (based on a warped perception of reality on her part), and pleas of \"trust me now, I won't gaslight on this\", culminating in a social media post claiming I avoided her and her request by answering no.\n\nAll in all, I'm tired from the exchange, but in the end I finally have external confirmation of what I suspected for sometime... she was/is the narcissist in the equation, not me. I can't count how many hours I lost to processing whether it was her or me, but I now have a thread I can clearly point to that shows it is her, not me.\n\nSo to passerby's, be careful who you pair with, always ask questions, watch for patterns of inconsistencies, never be the dopamine fix for someone else, and remain constant in your stand. As it is written in Proverbs:\n\n>Proverbs 5:4-6\n>\n>4. But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword. 5. Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. 6. Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. \n\nAlso as Captain Disillusion says:\n\n>Love with your heart, use your head for everything else."

I've received a large number of recommendations on how to distract from thinking about the possible theoretical paths, but none help beyond things I've cut out of my life entirely or want to keep out of my life.\n\nTL:DR, was allowed to call kids outside of the \"normal\" timeframe I usually call them while exwife has become more vocal on social media again. The last time she was, it was her emoting while preparing for a court case that didn't happen. Would like to know if anyone has dealt with that or something similar.\n\nToday is when I hand the kids back to their mother. My current situation with this is a different person from her family and friends picks up or drops off the kids every week, sometimes its her, her bf, her parents, her bf's family, etc, etc, or some combination. In a similar vein, phone calls to the kids is extremely sporadic as well, some weeks I can call nightly, some once a week, with the average being 2.667 times per week with the actual days changing from week to week. Normally, I can't speak with the kids on the day I drop them off (TBF, I had the kids for most of the day, so this constraint seems fine to me), however, today I was offered to call tonight by the people picking the kids up. (For some further context, my ex and I had several heated emails and txts sometime ago regarding the general inconsistencies around phone calls that created an extremely odd uptick in phone calls to the kids)\n\nIn response to the odd offer and its successful fulfilment, I peeked at some of her latest social media posts (to be clear, I only look when something really odd happens, like today), most of which revolve around her usual story of being the survivor of a narcissistic relationship. Among those posts was a few odd posts about \"my reaction to a narcissist doesn't make me a narcissist\" that are driving me up a wall. The last time I saw posts similar to those, I was informed that she was working on an alienation of parental affections case to reduce my parenting time.\n\nTo be clear, I have an attorney and have kept them informed of the situation as it \"evolves\", but since nothing has been filed, all we can do is wait. Additionally, I am praying for some kind of peace, and its moments like where I know God is in control, but feel very anxious about it all.\n\nSo if anyone has encountered something like this, what did you do? How did you cope?"

This was fine until it came to my youngest's parenting time switch where my ex offered me the entire week if I \"pinky-promised\" to not go anywhere. Our locality currently has a strict shelter-in-place/lockdown enforcement at the moment, so there is literally no nowhere to be other than home. That said, I agreed to it and unfortunately commented on both the absurdity of asking that and hypocrisy of how she has to know where I am with the kids at all times while not providing me the same information (Neither of us are required to tell the other any details of our parenting time in our locality, neither of us typically do, and during the parenting time I gave up while self isolating I didn't ask where the kids were because I knew she wouldn't tell me). My ex then rolled back the offer to just an extra day and threatened to take my daughter early since I had an opinion (which sadly involved law enforcement to prevent my ex from doing so).\n\nMy oldest child heard some of my complaint about knowing where the kids are, and during their call to my youngest asked where the youngest was. My ex and her partner are now preparing an alienation of affections case with the claim that I coached my oldest to ask for my youngest's location.\n\nTo be clear, I've already contacted my attorney and just  waiting for their instructions. Also, apologies for the use of possessives, I'm not implying anyone is \"owned\" by me, I'm just simply using them to express their relationship to me.\n\nI'm at a loss, all I wanted was a normal week with my kids in this abnormal, apocalyptic situation we're all in. I didn't ask for extra time and wasn't expecting anything, and now I feel like I'm about to lose everything and fight to just keep what little I have."

Eventually, the big bosses (idk if Persephone participates in the conference) decide that Demeter has her daughter for nine months, to help her on the job, and Hades has her for 3 months. (Yes, this is very weird no matter the perspective you take on the rest of the story. IDK either.)

Use her if you don't have the perk unlocked, even if you have not leveled her at all. You will see why.\n\n2. A Self Care and Self Care only heal takes at least 16/0.35=45.71 s. (Since you cannot bring other perks for the challenge, their effects do not matter.) Sloppy Butcher prolongs this time (I do not know by how much; I believe it increases the heal time by 33%, leading to ~61 s for a heal). Healing with the actual perk will hurt your chances of survival; that is half a gen you could've done for the entire team. Please, do not throw the game.\n\n3. Solution: heal by alternative means. Rely on someone else's Circle of Healing. Bring a med-kit and heal with it. An **untested to my knowledge** option is to have someone heal you and then finish the heal yourself. All of these are legitimate strategies in normal games and are much better than using the perk itself.\n\nOther strategies: You do not have other perks to protect you in various scenarios. If you see the killer heading towards you, run sooner than you normally would; you do not have Lithe or Sprint Burst. Do not rely on Dead Hard for an extra health state mid-chase. Do not go for aggressive unhooks; you do not have Borrowed Time. Avoid the killer once you're off the hook until you're healed; you do not have Off The Record or Decisive Strike. Gauge a killer before attempting to hide mid-chase; you do not have Off The Record, Lucky Break, Iron Will, etc. Split up on gens unless someone nearby has Prove Thyself, as you cannot bring it. Remember pallets and windows; you cannot bring Windows of Opportunity. Don't duck around with campers; you do not have Reassurance. Don't do totems unless it's NOED, Devour Hope, Crowd Control, Blood Favor or Pentimento; it takes away from gen time and you can always be hit by Retribution, Haunted Grounds and Undying.\n\nFinal note: I have no idea why we have to come up with creative work-arounds just to do an archive challenge.\n\nThis has been a PSA."

My Ex generally had an issue with respecting my boundaries, primarily he'd just grab me and not stop when I pulled away or asked him to stop in my typical fawning-way, but only when I'd get more stern and then I'd get cold-shouldered.\n\nOne time he woke me up in the middle of the night and started kissing me pretty aggressively while putting his entire bodyweight on me (he was almost twice as heavy as me, with me being 54kg at the time and him 90-100kg), I was turning my head away and saying no and tried to push him off of me, without success of course. In the beginning I was somewhat smiling (to no point did I think it was funny, I was scared almost instantly, I'm just.. fawn-y, but I have also communicated to him that even if I'm still being very nice about things, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm ok with it) but after a bit I was making it pretty clear I didn't want to be kissed, I was resisting for multiple minutes easily, felt like forever honestly, and after a while just stopped resisting. He didn't have sex with me afterwards but it was obvious that he was forcing himself on me against my will which he knew to some extent, because the day after, when I asked him to stop touching me, he instantly said \"is it because I didn't stop yesterday?\" so he must've known that was wrong to do.\n\nI guess I just wanna be able to \"classify\" what happened for whatever reason. Do you think this is a simple case of miscommunication, crossing of boundaries or does this fall under a form of sexual assault? I feel like if I asked my friends, they'd mostly say that it was fucked up, but probably not exactly sexual assault, so I'm leaning to that, but I feel like if someone else told me this, I'd very directly call it an assault. I felt violated and I have felt very violated throughout the relationship at many occasions."

My Ex generally had an issue with respecting my boundaries, primarily he'd just grab me and not stop when I pulled away or asked him to stop in my typical fawning-way, but only when I'd get more stern and then I'd get cold-shouldered.\n\nOne time he woke me up in the middle of the night and started kissing me pretty aggressively while putting his entire bodyweight on me (he was almost twice as heavy as me, with me being 54kg at the time and him 90-100kg), I was turning my head away and saying no and tried to push him off of me, without success of course. In the beginning I was somewhat smiling (to no point did I think it was funny, I was scared almost instantly, I'm just.. fawn-y, but I have also communicated to him that even if I'm still being very nice about things, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm ok with it) but after a bit I was making it pretty clear I didn't want to be kissed, I was resisting for multiple minutes easily, felt like forever honestly, and after a while just stopped resisting. He didn't have sex with me afterwards but it was obvious that he was forcing himself on me against my will which he knew to some extent, because the day after, when I asked him to stop touching me, he instantly said \"is it because I didn't stop yesterday?\" so he must've known that was wrong to do.\n\nI guess I just wanna be able to \"classify\" what happened for whatever reason. Do you think this is a simple case of miscommunication, crossing of boundaries or does this fall under a form of sexual assault? I feel like if I asked my friends, they'd mostly say that it was fucked up, but probably not exactly sexual assault, so I'm leaning to that, but I feel like if someone else told me this, I'd very directly call it an assault. I definitely felt violated. "

Or that ana *may* have her sleep and you shouldn't blindly dive her without that information. You're drastically overthinking if you're trying to keep a running mental checklist of everything while also playing the game. \n\nAs bap specifically you should take a high ground off-angle that is not easily divable that can give you LOS on the objective and both the enemy and your team. Play corners and don't default (auto pilot) and you should be fine.\n\n\n\nThe entire game of overwatch can be boiled down to: \"Team A saves their resources and cooldowns to make a play. Team B saves their resources and punishes Team A for wasting their resources that didn't accomplish their goal. \n\nPerfect example: Genji dashes and deflects *into* a team. He obviously dies here. Why? He used his resources and cooldowns and accomplished nothing with them. Now you use *your* resources to punish him. \n\n\nThat's Overwatch. That's the entire game. It is genuinely that simple. And once you *get* that. It is laughably easy to implement and punish the enemy for their mistakes at every rank.",

                "body": "Consider a player doing an unranked to GM. Just for ease of argument and visualization. \n\nThe highest you can get placed on a brand new fresh account is plat 4/5, but more often than not, the system places even T500 UR>GM accounts in low gold (a10, yeatle, etc). Because it's a fresh account and maybe you just popped off for your 7 games. \n\nThe issue is that once you're placed, you can only skip 2 or 3 brackets at a time, which takes 7 wins. But because MMR will exponentially change, you get placed in games that, visually, don't match your SR icon. \n\nConsider A10 or Yeatle in an UR>GM. They get placed, idk, gold 3. These gentlemen will then win some 23 games in a row after placement. But as stated before, you can only go up 2, and rarely 3 brackets every update. Meaning that by the time they're that 23 games into it, their SR is plat 2, (g3>g1, G1>p4, p4>p2) but they are in 4.3k lobbies due to MMR. Which is completely true. You can watch A10's unranked to GM zarya or DVA. By the time he's plat 4, he's [getting paired with names hes familiar with](https://youtu.be/v_QVBHABA4A?t=9828)\n\nThis is one of the major issues plaguing ranked. Because to *climb* the SR ladder, you need to win *more* than you lose. But if your MMR is adjusted already to your actual skill rating, which should result in about 50/50 win loss, then you can feel *stuck* at a certain SR rank or bracket that does not match your MMR. \n\nThe side effects are: \n\n1) You the player feeling like your skill is not properly reflected in the outward facing rank, that other players see and is supposed to give an at-a-glance view of your abilities as a player.\n\n2) You the player getting flamed for 'being gold in a diamond lobby'. Despite the MMR of the lobby being about equal. (This is aside from the obvious matchmaking failure that puts literal golds in diamond lobbies. I'm not talking about those players.)  \n\n3) A good thing! Smurfs are not put in gold lobbies when they are gold sr. That's great. The system works. But the SR simply doesn't match their skill rating. If the system itself has decided that they are too good to be in gold, then why do they have a gold icon? Why does someone who's obviously smurfing and in a 30 game win streak need to 'climb' out of gold and 'earn' it? They're clearly not gold and the system is not putting them in gold games. So what's with the icon? Just jump them up closer to where the system thinks they belong.\n\n4) Forces players to play more games, which is artificial engagement, to climb. I get they they want you playing as much as possible, but by doing so, SR is less as an achievement to show off the hard work and skill of a player and more just a visual of \"who played more games this season?\". Causing it to be outright inaccurate or false, and thus meaningless or invaluable. You can't make the thing that players work for to be both desirable AND meaningless. That doesn't work. That's illogical. \n\n\nGranted the examples I'm giving are extremes, but they're to make a point. Because it is happening to a lot of people, just on a much smaller scale. \n\nBlizz tried to avoid this by setting profiles to private by default,  when what they really need to do is implement a hard cap between the disparity of the MMR system and the SR system. They used to have systems in place for win streaks where you'd have massive SR gains on a win streak. The equivalent of skipping 2 or 3 brackets *per win*, but they did away with that some time ago.\n\n**TL;DR** MMR adjust very quickly. SR adjusts very slowly. The gap between the two can be extremely vast apart, leading to players feeling like they are not accurately represented, or causing animosity between teammates. Blizz removed open profiles, but could instead set a limit to how far your SR and MMR can be from each other. They had systems in place in the past that helped accomplish this, but have since been removed."

This process left most of the car defect-free, which I am happy with. However, there are some defects left in the rear decklid that need to be compounded. I intend to use CG V34 or either Griot's Correcting Cream or Complete Compound. Following that, do you believe that I can go straight back to V38 as a final polish or should I use V36 as an in-between step? Based on a commonly known product, V36 is similar to Meguiar's M205.\n\nThank you for looking. Any input is considered."

The black album and Load/Reload are masterpieces, however you decided to spin it. \n\nMetal elitism in general is just so stupid man. I personally don't care what people think about my music.

She looks attractive, and from our conversation she seems to be pretty bubbly and funny, like she used to be. I asked her whether we could meet up and she said she was down, and that i should just tell her a time and place and we could catch up. I want to first get to know more about her personality, whether she has changed or not in the 5 years since i last talked to her, before expressing romantic interest in her.\n\nThe reason why i'm making this post on reddit is because i've never done anything like this before. This is the first time i am interacting with someone with the intent of potentially being more than friends. I would be okay with being her friend also, but based on what some old friends of mine who still talk to her told me about her, and since i've never done this before, i want to give it a shot. \n\nSince i'm inexperienced though, i fear i run the risk of either coming off too strong (which would be awkward) or her not interpreting any romantic interest at all from my side. I would love it if you all could provide me with some tips for our first time meeting, like what i could wear, what we could do, how i could interact with her etc."

My baseline for weight loss is 1500. I.e. for December there's 6 days I want to be able to eat about 3000 calories (party!) so if my deficit now is 1500 to lose, I eat at 1300 for the month of December but then get 6 party days! yay! This seems pretty sustainable to me, that is averaging 1.5 party days a week and being just a bit more diligent otherwise. I don't generally struggle with 1500 calories so 1300 is not great but ok and seems like a good trade off so long as I do get to party. \n\nDoes this seem like a sustainable/good idea? I can't think of a better way to do it, and I really don't want to gain this season, but instead actually lose. I would never be going under 1200 and actually would be eating 1300-1400 mostly. \n\nHas anyone done anything similar? Thank you!"

Despite this, her power level is only relative to (if not lower than) the party's as a grave cleric, meaning by large the party can depend on her pacifistic methods as a small healer after combat. I'm aware of the fact that this may lead into DMPC behavior but I'm mitigating how much combat influence she possesses, just a way to help advance the plot.\n\nShe was at first introduced in a pre-campaign session to introduce the new player to D&D and to give him a more permanent connection to the party once they completed a quest they were all involved in, and while her anonymous devil-may-care attitude was sure to draw questions about her motives, they were still okay with keeping her around.\n\nBackstory aside and even 3 sessions after her introduction I'm not quite sure I've gotten the attachment to Rosalind that I'm looking for as this faithful spirit that searches for a band of champions. She handed a quest or two but haven't given her a chance to be more involved with the party emotionally. Any suggestions?"

However something new came up with the way the quest interacts with Abyssal Curses.  \n\n\nFor those who had the mercy of not encountering abyssal curses, they add a spell to your opponent's hand that forces them to take increasing damage with the more abyssal curses you give and cycle to your opponent. It may be a spell that deals damage, but it **does not interact with your opponent's Spell Damage.** It does however count as opponent's spell which forwards the progress of \\[\\[Defend the Dwarven District\\]\\] and I learned the hard way.  \n\n\nPoint is, Questline hunter shouldn't interact with the spell damage of abyssal curses if it doesn't even count as a spell they have to cast to deal damage, and doesn't interact with any source of spell damage to begin with. I sincerely hope this is a bug and not a feature of the quests and curses working as intended because it already makes an unfun deck unwinnable in this matchup. I might also just be picky because Curse warlock is my new main deck but I still want to enjoy the game, but if you expect a lot of Questline hunter don't run Abyssal curses."

                "body": "This barely counts as a horror story to most, but I still felt wronged and can\u2019t just let this stew inside me anymore. It\u2019s a long one, and names are of course kept anonymous but if you\u2019re out there you know what you did.\n\nI\u2019ve been running a 5e campaign that recently had its one-year anniversary, as a matter of fact it was my second-ever campaign as a DM. While it felt like I\u2019ve grown as a newer DM and my existing players enjoy the campaign, still far from perfect or exceptional, I\u2019m saddened that only one of the four OG\u2019s remain.\n\nIt started out as a small homebrew campaign where I had ambitions far beyond my understanding, and I got my jumpstart on an off-shoot of a discord server where the campaigns could be hosted with more leniency on attendance or bogging down on server rules. The original four were:\n\nThe Hexblade, a cunning aasimar that got his hands on a powerful greatsword lost to time and divinity alike\n\nThe Dreams-Druid, a kalashtar with a habit of starting families among beasts left alone\n\nThe Samurai, an elven bounty hunter with a mortal enemy he just can\u2019t keep up with\n\nand the Ancients-Paladin, a treant who views most humanoids with disdain and tends to the squirrels in his foliage.\n\nI felt like I owed them the world even though they expected nothing, not even a session 0 was had. A mistake on my part, one I won\u2019t soon repeat.\n\nWhat I made up for was a story that tried in each way I used to peak their interest and power, give them a focal point in the story. Right away I wanted to satisfy the Samurai\u2019s bounty, give in to the Ancient\u2019s imposing power over \u201cfleshbags\u201d, bounce off of the Dreams-Druid\u2019s whimsy, and make use of the Hexblade\u2019s patron being the sword of a fallen Titan. The only problem was that there were plenty of levels to go and I was already satisfying them by level 4. The campaign would feel more and more like a roleplay-heavy adventure while the party had made combative characters, but it didn\u2019t look like that deterred any of them, they seemed to be having fun.\n\nThey would journey east so the Samurai would invest in a popular artificer\u2019s new magic item, and made it poignant that the artificer\u2019s efforts would tie in to the future of the campaign so they could visit the accompanying presentation for the magic item. I also had them meet up with two new factions of Order and Chaos that harken back to the Hexblade\u2019s patron, I felt like I planted so many seeds that the complacency of my players may have weened off. It certainly didn\u2019t help that the Artificer would end up assassinated before the party\u2019s eyes, but I thought the mystery centered around the artificer\u2019s assailant would want to drive the plot forward. Maybe inviting a second Hexblade(2) and invoking their development as they choose the Chaos faction would spice things up and keep them guessing the plot.\n\nAnd then the Samurai left, out of the three was the harshest. \u201cIt isn\u2019t entertaining me as much as I thought it would.\u201d No constructive criticism or even a thought of what I was doing wrong. It\u2019s okay, I thought. I don\u2019t plan that far ahead so there wasn\u2019t a lot of character development lost, heck he could even come back as a boss at some point. But I still felt horrible, like I committed a sin and he couldn\u2019t tell me which one.\n\nNevertheless the show had to go on. I even started a LFG and advertised my campaign so I could begin the new arc with a slew of faces who were already in the Chaos faction while other things went on in the foreground. I got plenty of applicants, all were amazing, and the Dreams-Druid and I picked the two that would join us. What I didn\u2019t expect was that both of them would be permanent no-shows, even after working diligently on their character concepts. I was at least able to snag a Rogue in from the server, after a lot of trial and error.\n\nWe started a mission to collect some more allies for the Chaos faction and, oh, what\u2019s this? The Rogue wants to leave so he can join a campaign that he\u2019s been anticipating a seat with for a long time? I understand, you can have fun. If you want, I can treat you to a spectacular send-off. It was still fun while it lasted. And yet, I felt like I was just the B-movie that whole time.\n\nWe\u2019d keep this group together for quite some time, with Hexblade(2) having to temporarily switch characters after a nat 1 on a banishment sent him to the shadow realm and the party wanted to save Hex(2)\u2019s behind. Smooth sailing, more seeds planted but I could tell the party\u2019s interest in their own characters was weening again. They traveled some more, swindled a portal-room off a military outpost, got a gargantuan automaton from the Chaos faction to help them out while they escaped, fought all kinds of baddies and the demonic version of the dude that sent Hex(2) to the shadow realm in the first place, and it was at this point that I picked up another player, a good old Wizmonk, he got along well with Dreams-Druid. I really liked his character concept and it allowed me to flesh out more lore while I planted more seeds, like the relationship between the Order and Chaos factions once they got back to home world. Turns out the Order faction packed quite a punch and dealt with Chaos, leaving the party cornered in a dilemma of if they should switch sides or stick to their guns. I was surprised they still wanted to be with Chaos, even with how impulsive and dangerous the Chaos\u2019s leader comes off compared to Order. Dude had to blow up a mountain with the automaton to get out of dodge.\n\nHexblade(1) even made a grandiose display of why he and his titan-sword are a force to be reckoned with, and you\u2019d think that would incentivize his interest in the campaign. Turns out his attendance got spottier than ever, but he said it was just issues with his job so maybe things could go back to normal? I love how clever he can be especially with his recent dip into artificer!\n\nIn the meantime, the Order faction was beginning to take a lot more control so the party had to mobilize their efforts when it came to being a dominant force, even having to reclaim a bastion lost to time and later having to track down and steal back the automaton now claimed by the Order faction, lest its original creator wreak havoc. As if things couldn\u2019t get worse, it seems the guy who imprisoned Hexblade (2) was right about (2) being a bad omen with his patron unleashing some terrible things, as it looks like demonic summonings are running rampant in the local country. Kill some demons, recruit a Paladin with nothing left to lose, take some bad with the good.\n\nThen it looks like another bombshell dropped. Ancients-Paladin came with bad news saying family and work has really overtaken his schedule and that he had to drop the campaign, at least saying he might come back in the future. I definitely found him the funniest as this walking tree that laid the smite on foes and cursed all \u201cfleshbags\u201d. It was gonna be a lot harder to get the ball rolling in terms of comedy.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough I got radio silence from Hexblade(1). I messaged him multiple times to no avail, not a single response. Worse yet, there were times on game night where I saw him online, even active as \u2018do-not-disturb.\u2019 I called him out on it in messages but still got nothing. It wasn\u2019t like I planned to reveal that he was the son of an angel, or have an active BBEG reveal with someone stealing his Titan-sword. It wasn\u2019t like he had the most potential out of all the players even though I desperately tried to love them all equally. It tore my confidence apart, was I just not good enough? \n\nAt least the other players were able to reassure me that I might not suck, and that they do enjoy the campaign. After all, it wasn\u2019t like Ancients Paladin was also spending his time somewhere else in the exact same time slot with another group, telling a half-truth in order not to make me feel jealous while at the same time leaving the server to avoid confrontation or guilt...right? And it wasn\u2019t like I was told this by Dreams-Druid with no direct way of finding out for myself, a month or so after the departure happened...right? I was totally being petty, in the haze of both players leaving so soon, with the small consolation of a new Rogue joining the party, so I won\u2019t take for granted the time everyone\u2019s here. It\u2019s also been a lesson in trying to keep everyone\u2019s attention, knowing that while I can\u2019t please everyone I can still find my audience. \n\nIt still hurts to see people leave when you can check their social status, so players, be honest with if or why you need to leave a campaign. Nine times out of ten the DM can take criticism and learn from it, or they\u2019ll be willing to accept or at least debate if you should make the jump to another group. We save our time for you, just like you do for us."

If you asked me right now, I\u2019d take a WR or QB (or Kelce) first, but a lot can change over the next 7 months.",

I\u2019d go Samuel because he\u2019s got the most targets over his last 3 games, and fwiw if they\u2019re going with Wentz, he got a lot more targets in the beginning of the season when Wentz was starting",

I also take Biotin, Vitamin D and Vitamin B6/B12 with folic acid as well as Yaz for the last 10 years. \n\nI always take the 4/4 over 24 hours Valtrex dose when I feel a new sore coming on and I use Zovirax ointment once collapsed and oozing. \n\nI am wondering - is taking a single daily Valtrex dose long term for just oral herpes a thing? \nWould this slow my constant cycle of outbreaks? \nAre there any long term side effects?\n\nThanks!"

                "body": "**My Take on this Issue:**\n\n1. There're studies that show that Turkey-based Syrians commit less crimes on average than Turks themselves. [\u00b9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X22000481#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2C%20DiD%20estimates,per%20native%20resident%20in%20particular.) [\u00b2](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jeborg/v194y2022icp568-582.html) , so personally I would rule out the potentially most rational justification, which is \"Increased crime rates\". Unfortunately though, many people think that refugees *do* increase crime rates, but that's simply the effect of selection bias in the media.\n\n2. However, I still don't like refugees myself. I think that they are culturally incompatible with any country in the Balkan. I don't even like how they dress, let alone how they talk or how they cruise down the street with their 400 children. However, there're *a lot* of exceptions. I very often see Syrians who are more civilised and modern than the locals. So using this as a justification for generalisation is illogical asf.\n\n3. As for hating refugees themselves regardless of their impact, I don't think that it's rational either. In some wars (like the Syrian Civil War) there're thousands of explanation for why someone wouldn't fight, and the most obvious ones are the fact that there is no military in Syria that represents the refugees in a good way; as well as the fact that a lot of fathers just cannot leave their children and wives, who were not used to having a job back in Syria (and don't have the education qualifications to even start), in Turkey just to go and fight. Therefore, again, a generalisation cannot be made here since every person comes from an entirely different background.\n\n4. As for the decline in economic opportunities, since I'm capitalist I do think that the influx of labor is beneficial to any economy on earth (except maybe India), and I prefer the long-term economic development over short-term life satisfaction.\n\n5. I do as well agree with the last option. A lot of the hate directed at Syrians comes from an entitled, racist core, that is usually masked with one of the justifications given in this poll.\n\nI hope you would have a good discussion in the comments, instead of turning it into a war zone.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1188cxx)"

Lakshmi & Sudhir, 2016; MH Bahadori & M Jahanbakhsh, 2011; etc) in which patients showed an improvement in symptoms after therapeutic intervention that doesn't involve exposure.\n\nFear extinction occurs in the amygdala only when the patient experiences the feared situation neutrally or positively. In order for this to happen, the patient must obviously \"experience\" the feared situation, and be exposed to it.\n\nHowever, in therapies like MCT, the patient doesn't expose himself to the feared situation, but fear extinction happens regardless.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nMy thoughts (correct me if I'm wrong, and tell me if I'm right): The \"situation\" that activates the amygdala and leads to a fear respone are merely the anxious thoughts & self consciousness. When these two are shut down, the fear response does not occur.\n\nEdit, further explanation: We could hypothesise that the difference between healthy and unhealthy (e.g. socially anxious) individuals lies solely in their perception of various situations, rather than their actual objective emotional response to the situations.\n\nIt's like a blind man who links every sound he hears to dangerous animals; fearing these animals is \"healthy\", but perceiving these sounds to be of dangerous animals is the \"unhealthy\" part.\n\nThanks in advance!"

So I've had braces once before this, but they didn't work out because my retainer was the wrong one and I was terrified of that orthodontist to say anything\n\nNow it's 6 years later and I'm at a different orthodontist where my insurance covers it fully. I'm at just now a month\n\nI have top and bottom this time, which was a bit of an adjustment but it think I'm doing pretty good.\n\nSo, I have to eat softer foods because of the roots on one tooth needing to adjust to the extractions I had. So I'm not eating hard candy, I don't think I've ever eaten a raw apple in my life, and I don't like popcorn. But my brackets keep coming off. And I mean completely, I have 9 of them off in a baggie. They're not even leaving glue residue on my teeth like I remember. Like, the slightest pressure yanks them off. I suppose I'm used to the ones I had when I was 12 and I (quite literally) was hit in the mouth semi often and they never budged.\n\nMy dentist made a face when I told her where I was at and told me good luck. The orthodontist place gives the the heebie jeebies in the sense that it doesn't feel very clean. I've never seen the orthodontist guy who's name is on the practice too. He's always on his phone in the back room office.\n\nI don't think I can transfer though, my insurance seems to hate the idea of orthodontic treatment. The only option I can think of is getting dentaquest? Supposedly it'd cover this at a better orthodontistry place, but I'd have to wait months for that. Possibly a year.\n\nI'm debating on trying to play up some flattery and get it written off as a bad batch of glue, but I'm down deep in the hole because only the first 4 are covered and there's 9 off. I had to pull my wires out because they nearly stabbed through my cheek. This is cuz there's back brackets off too which are more expensive.\n\nI probably need to get them to even out the \"blue dental cement\" too, because they didn't make it even on both sides and I think it's made me start grinding my teeth in my sleep.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do? I just want straight teeth.. my bottom ones rub along the top of my mouth and I could end up with an abscess if this isn't fixed soon.\n\nTl;dr orthodontist seems kinda shitty and multiple brackets have come off. Insurance is shit so it might be impossible to switch orthodontists. I have no clue what to do so I'm here"

I really enjoy fromsoft games for their difficulty and it is exactly this reason why I think they should have created a separate easy mode. I decided to play the game fully blind and started off with a melee build. Halfway through the game, I was struggling with a boss fight where I had to fight both the crucible knight and the misbegotten warrior at the same time. My friend then convinced me that we were actually expected to use spirit summons in the game. I started off using the level 1 wolf summons and they didn\u2019t seem too overpowered. I continued to use summons throughout my play through until I beat the game. After beating the game, I found out that spirit summons are intended to be an easy mode for the game. I even saw videos of spirit summons beating bosses on their own while the player is just AFK. I feel that spirit summons spoiled my first play through of the game and its all because fromsoft wanted to add an easy mode without it actually being an official mode. It would have been better if they added a separate easy mode where you can use summons and a normal mode where you cant use summons. That way you can\u2019t accidentally cheat yourself of the intended experience of the game.\n\nTLDR: spirit summons spoiled my playthrough because I didn\u2019t realize it was an easy mode."

All of his actions have to be observed from multiple different perspectives, since they really cannot be determined as either pure good or pure evil. Dottore has lots of contradicting sides to him and he really represents a certain kind of duality in humanity, which is why I don't believe he's this pure evil the story and the fandom paints him as. I still like the villanous portrayal of him, it's kind of his imago at this point, but a complex character like him also has lots of misunderstandings.\n(I'm speaking of the original Dottore btw, Webttore is a whole different can of worms)",

Best visuals ever. No paranoia. Suddenly I got this teft from my aunt \u00absorry you can\u2019t come tomorrow, I\u2019m sick and not just a little. I\u2019m in so much pain. I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u00bb and since she is my fathers sister (my father actually killes himself) and she was my motiver figure, I got really scared that she did the same. I know both of them got abused in the past. So I took 2 xanax and I calmed down, still very intense visuals, but I was calm. I called my Family and everything was okay again. I\u2019m so grateful for this experience, and my friends offered to go see her with me. Sounds like a bad trip, but it was really eye opening. \n\nI\u2019m not ready for 400ugs tho, 340, was what I did last time, but that was fun, I think I\u2019ll stick around that range till my mind is stronger. My aunt is wonderful and I appreciate her."

Because now I feel like I can access these feelings easier.\n\nBy all means psychedelics have great uses, makes you want to improve yourself. This makes you wanna improve others I feel like.\n\nNot saying this is for everyone, but if you, like me feel very selfish, and you feel like this could help, consider it. If you\u2019ve already tried other methods, like therapy and stuff. Also of course don\u2019t take too much. I took a bit over 100mg, also I\u2019m a 200 pound male, so consider a lower dose if that\u2019s not you.\n\nSo the start of christmas is great so far."

I tend to question most of the things our teachers were saying outside academic stuff and I was generally not afraid to voice out what's on my mind which sometimes lead me to talking back to them. (This didn't give me that much trouble except for two occasions). The reason for my actions would probably be the feeling of our teachers taking advantage of us because we're just students while they have the authority to give commands without being questioned and I hated that. \n\nBut over the years I realized that fighting against rules and authority doesn't matter and that it's futile because in the end of the day, I don't have the power to change things. So I always convinced myself to \"Just follow them like how everyone else does. Be obedient. That will save you trouble.\" which was really hard to do. \nNow that I'm in college, I still hold the same sentiment but I don't act on it \u2014 I even try not to think about it anymore because over the years, I lost all my confidence and motivation. Thinking about how I want to change things but lacking the power to do so makes me feel helpless and overall useless. \nIs this what they call growing up or I just lost what they call \"sparks\" of youth too early? \n\n\n\u2022 I've read about the functions but I can't really use it that well yet. I'm curious as to where this would fall and if it would possible to type me just by basing on this?"

                "body": "**\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI'm 21. Female. I'm pretty much conventional. I have very few friends and they often see me as someone who's \"motherly\". I love public speaking when I'm prepared, I can talk to strangers like it's nothing, I can probably dance in the middle of the street without a care, I crack lame jokes and make meme references on daily basis. One of my college friends told me that I am \"weird\". I may seem lively and energetic but I don't like interacting with people that much because it's tiring. When someone invites me to hangout, I can already feel the exhaustion just from the thought of it.\n\nWhen I like something, I tend to obsess over it. I'm probably lazy and I procrastinate a lot but when I do something, I want it to be perfect. I get frustrated if I can't do something correctly and when I feel like there is no order around me. \n\nI'm often viewed as a killjoy and straitlaced even when I was younger because I tend to follow what we've been told to do. Some of my classmates and even some of my friends are afraid of me. When someone I'm not close with sits next to me, I can somehow feel that they're uncomfortable and tense. My friends almost never confide personal things to me. They probably think that I'll judge them for it, I won't relate anyway or they think my \"if it doesn't concern me, i don't care\" attitude will also be applied to them. \n\n**\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**\n\nI haven't been diagnosed with anything regarding my mental health but I have some symptoms of depression which has been on going for years.\n\n**\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nI grew up in an authoritarian catholic family. I have six siblings; 5 older and 1 younger than me. I wasn't paid much attention to while I was growing up and I've been told a lot that I was ugly. During gradeschool tho, from 1st to 6th grade I have always been one of the top students so they recognize me there. They labeled me \"smart\" and \"independent\" ever since but I know in myself that I'm dumb. I don't even have an idea how I reached college when I'm this dumb. \n\nWhen it comes to religion though, my family wasn't particularly that religious. They attend mass but they don't bring up god or anything to scare or lecture us. I was an altar server for four years but I'm not that religious anymore. I might have been disillusioned and I don't know, I somehow doubt the whole idea of religion now. \n\n**\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI don't have a job but I'm currently a psychology student. Of course I do like it because it's interesting but it feels weird sometimes. All our course have are theories unlike other courses that are based on actual proven facts. Also, I don't like handling people but I'm in this course so it's kinda eh-\n\n**\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would probably feel refreshed. That means I can do anything I want inside my room without any disturbance.\n\n**\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**\n\nI'm not good at sports. I'm an indoor person. I like using my hands on activities that's related to handicrafts and art. \n\n**\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI'm not that curious, I'm more concerned with the realities of here and now so my mind doesn't wander that much. And I don't like it when it does wander, I get ideas but can't execute it which is very frustrating so I'd rather not. \n\nMost of my ideas has something to do with power, structure and order in the society. Back then I always thought \"If only I have the power, I'd destroy everything and then I'm gonna rebuild it all, and this time, there will be with much more order and everyone will have a better life\". I know it's silly.\n\n**\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nIt depends. What will i get from taking this role? I don't like taking responsibility because I'm not confident with my knowledge on things. I wouldn't want to take the blame of dragging down my members with me. But if I had no choice then why not. I probably have average leadership skills. My leadership style whenever I'm put in the position is coaching. \n\n**\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI think I am. I'm pretty good at activities that has something to do with hands, except video games. I don't like those. As I've mentioned earlier I like doing things involving handicrafts and arts. \n\n**\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI don't think so. I can pretty much do average art but I wouldn't say I'm artistic. I enjoy drawing, reading, listening to music, watching movies and  taking photos. I don't have any explanation for this one. I just enjoy them. \n\n**\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nI like the romanticized version of the past in my head. I think the present is boring but at the same time, it's giving me a lot of anxiety. I think the future will either be worse or better than the present. \n\nI think too much about the past that I wish to go back in time. I honestly don't wanna be in the present just because of the problems I don't wanna face but I know the world isn't going to wait for anyone so I still try and solve them so I at least can have a normal future ahead.\n\n**\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI think first whether it's within my abilities or not, and if it is then why not. I often accept requests of help from others, thinking of it as some sort of investment. I know I'll benefit something from it someday. \n\n**\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nYes. I enjoy consistency in life because changes makes me uneasy. \n\n**\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nVery. If you're gonna do something, it better be something efficient. I can't say anything about productivity because I'm not productive myself.\n\n**\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nYes. I don't often do it but of course, I do it for the same reason everyone else does it. For my own advantage. I usually do it by convincing others of what they should do. \n\n**\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nDigital art and traditional drawing. I find it satisfying when you finish a single piece.\n\n**\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nI'm an audio-visual learner. I generally struggle with chaotic environment. This question confuses me idk. I prefer classes involving logic and creativity.\n\n**\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nProbably average. I break up projects intro manageable tasks. Finishing a part motivates me to finish the rest. Winging and improvising things gives me anxiety. \n\n**\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nI don't really have these. I'm just trying to be someone that i am expected to be.\n\n**\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nFailing and being seen as someone who can't do anything. I get really uncomfortable when there's no rules or guide to follow. Also, when things are unplanned or just free flowing. I want everything to be predictable so I'll know what I should do in different kinds of situation. \n\n**\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nThings are going as planned and I get to enjoy simple things. Also, when there are no problems to worry about.\n\n**\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nHaving monetary problem, too much procrastination which I always regret, failing grades and too much stress ganging up on me at the same time. \n\n**\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI'm very much attached to reality so I pay attention to what's around me. \n\n**\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nFirst, nothing then I'll probably start thinking about the decisions I made from the past up to the present. Also, horror images. And if I'm really bored, I'm gonna start making up and imagining a whole story in my head. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI need some time to make an important decision. I have to weigh the pros and cons of things. And of course after a long consideration, I don't change my mind anymore. \n\n**\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nQuite a while. Sometimes I need to pause and think about what I'm exactly feeling before I can point it out because most of the time, I don't feel anything. On a scale of 1-10, I'm gonna say 5. \n\n**\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nSometimes when it's not worth of my explanation or I'm too lazy. But most of the time, I say what's on my mind without caring if it will stop the conversation. It's better to give them a different perspective sometimes and I think it will help them somehow. \n\n**\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nNo. I tend to follow them. I definitely don't think they know better and I don't think they should be challenged either. Authority is not above anyone at all, they're just following what the book says just like everyone else."

There is some devily/ demony lore to it all. My problem is, I want this guy to be super physically tanky but barbarian and fiend don't really match. Maybe fighter and fiend? I need help!!!"

However, despite that, she can also tend to be very lazy at times, and is often seen around the house sleeping and resting for no particular reason. Often, she seems lonely and miserable, and desires deep, great connection to others.\nAshley is rather introverted, and would rather spend time alone than with other random people.

We argued and she threatened to breakup with me if I didn't stop the project. I chose her, but I want both. She said that our role-plays are for fun and not for making money. I said that I want to still do this project. That if I couldn't achieve my dream, I will die trying. I even said she can pull out and just support me, but she said no to that. I don't know what I should do. I can't go behind her back and do this because she will find out and I am bad at keeping these kinds of secrets. I still love her, so breaking up is out of the question. And I really want my ideas to see the sun. What should I do in this situation?\n\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend doesn't want me to work on my comic/T.V. show because she and a few people fear it won't work. I want to continue it, but can't.

I was recently betrayed by my dad who no longer believed me. After my dad's side of the family left, things got worse. I was eventually sent away because I did something \"very bad.\" I am now living with my grandma, aunt, and uncle. (from dad's side).  I have learned the complete truth not the condensed version.

The suprise for me was that leader of the biggest polish right wing nationialist party congratulated her as well (tho all of his supporters criticised him for that) :\n\n\"Another literature Nobel! Polish success makes me happy regardless of the writers's political views. Congratulations to Olga Tokarczuk.\"\n\nAnd the respond after being criticised :\n\n\"Calm down.

So, i want you to say me if my answers are correct too (words in brackets are ones u should check) and if i got sth wrong, please explain to me why.\n1.Police officers, firefighters, and rescue teams risk their own lives while saving others and earn a fraction of what sports stars make. It's truly a pity that (few) of them are given the same recognition as our sporting heroes.\n2.You (must had forgotten) to tell them how to get to our house. Otherwise, they would have arrived long before now.\n3. If the trekkers (decided to take) the shorter route, they would be in trouble now. Fortunately they didn't.\n\nThanks in advance :)"

I would say Fe-Ne-Ti-Si but it doesnt fit this extroverted-introverted function scheme. So i would have to go with either Fe-Si-Ne-Ti (ESFJ) or Ne-Ti-Fe-Si (ENTP). I relate to some of this types characteristics but not in the way yeah thats me type of shit like i think a lot of people do. I would say im more ESFJ cuz im all about people extroverted guy that loves helping others and cares about them and the fee\u0142ings of others have huge impact of my well-being. I simply LOVE people and helping them is something that gives me meaning in my life. So that's i think Fe-dom shit. But in other way im really much about abstract stuff, i zone out a lot and im interested in theoretic stuff, gettin knowledge about everything, having multiple hobbies, problems sticking to one thing and i think im very objective and analytical, i always take all arguments from both sides, analyze them before forming an opinion and tend to resolve problems using logical thinking rather than relying on emotions and im not a really emotional human being. So kinda this Ne-Ti kind of stuff. And I dont see much of Si in me, i have good memory and can recall events with details, but i prefer experimenting than sticking to traditional methods and im not really a detail-oriented person, i also dont recall past events or relive it."

Not only is mora one of the easiest materials to get (unlike talent books and weapon materials which are resin exclusive) but their rewards also stop increasing after WL6\n\nBoW rewards should be atleast 80k by WL7 and atleast 100k by WL8\n\n\n\n\u2605Blossoms of Revelations: [problems are very similar so i'm not gonna repeat them]\n\nBoR rewards should be about {6-7 blues/6-7 purples} by WL7 and {6-7 blues/7-8 purples} by WL8\n\n\n\n\u2605Weekly Bosses: with the 6th weekly boss coming in 2.5, they will consume way too much resin. and they don't even offer quite a challenge for an AR55 player (Childe lasts like 40sec lol)\n\nmihoyo needs to either increase the amount of resin we get per day, or reduce the resin required per WB, or makes them a non resin activity since you can do them once per week anyways.\nIt will be cool too if they add lvl100 weekly bosses with higher rewards\n\n\n\n\u2605Artifact Domains: Most people agree that artifact farming is the hardest part about upgrading characters, and it actually is.\nyou can spend literal months to farm a decent 4pc, not to mention domains like the crimson witch which gives a totally useless second artifact (Lavawalker).\nArtifact domains also don't offer a good challenge, you can spend your entire daily resin in like 5mins, further reducing daily playtime for late game players\n\nmihoyo should add lvl100 artifact domains, which are harder and give better rewards (\n\n\n\n\u2605Labyrith Warriors: this 2.2 event was one of the best events by far. We need something with the same concept which resets weekly.\n\n\n\u2605CO-OP boss takedown: you can find this concept in many games, especially online ones. You basically fight a huge hp boss (like 3 millions) in CO-OP mode. The boss deals weak damage, but gets enraged the less his hp gets. the fight lasts until you defeat the boss or you and all your teammates falls and the rewards are based on how low you get the boss hp to. resets weekly\n\n\n\nWill the reward changes make building characters too easy ?\n\n--> Obtaining materials will be easier, but characters will also need more investiment to face the new harder content. So building characters will be easier overall, but not TOO easy\n\n\nWon't the content be too hard ?\n\n--> It can, lucky for us CO-OP exists. Or you can just farm lower domains until you are strong enough"

Usually the dirty stalls types are my trigger that I need to get up and go IRL. Most of the time they're not just dirty, but stalls are broken, lots of people hanging around in them and there are clothes everywhere (like it's a locker room/bathroom area). I get the sense that those are lack of privacy type dreams for me.   \n\n\nI kinda like the posh ones, though those are infrequent as hell. The bathroom always seems like a school bathroom, but the stalls are endless and spotless, and there are rest areas (like couches, but waaaaaay in the back), good lighting, etc. Makes me never want to leave the bathroom when I have that one, another plus - I'm ALONE IN THERE! When I get that type, or that type pairs with the lost in the mall type dreams, it's always a little weird and creepy.",

I also discovered that I have pretty substantial waves and, in the underside layer, curls. I've been using a hairdryer and brushing my hair for years, so I guess I've been straightening and damaging it to hell. The top layer is super dry, relatively find and prone to breakage and frizz. I was also a teenager in the early-mid 2000s when everyone was aggressively flat-ironing their hair that sucked me into some shit habits (rip.) My mom and little sister have naturally straight hair and my dad (who it looks like I mostly get my hair from) never had hair go past his neck. \n\nAnyway, this is a very new and exciting discovery, but also frustrating because I'm 31 and I have no idea where to go from here. Three of my biggest issues are frizz, losing definition when I use a comb, and also flattening when I sleep. They say not to comb it, but it gets so freakin' frizzy that I look like Hermione Granger sticking her wand in an electrical socket. \n\nAnyway, how long did it take the majority of you guys to figure out a good routine, especially for sleeping and frizz? I'm of European descent and my hair seems to be about a 2B and looks 2C in the underside. There's even a tiny amount of random straight-ish strands?? I'm really frustrated \ud83e\udd72\n\nEdit: also, I know you're not supposed to wash your hair everyday, but will it do damage if I get it wet without shampoo?"

Yes, the songs may be more bland than those in Froot, but other songs are beautiful, fun to play, and it also has sad-I-want-to-cry songs. And even \"weird\" ones like Emotional Machine! One of the problems? The aesthetic of the era!\n\nWe came from TFJ, Electra Heart and FROOT. You can't think of EH without thinking of tumblr vibes, blond hair with dark roots and hearts painted in cheeks. You can't think of FROOT without thinking in neon, colourful and space-like aesthetics. But for L+F... what? The covers are in black and white, but only with Marina's face. A simple aesthetic, but those images say nothing (at least, to me). Then came videos like Handmade Heaven and Orange Trees, and they were full of nature imagery, but it was abandoned later. It seemed like the album had an idea \"Love and Fear\", but you couldn't really see Love or Fear represented in the aesthetics. You see all the photoshoots from that era and can't find a common theme that guides them. The album has many fun songs, but the cover makes the album seem \"serious and mature\". \n\nI am sure that the overall boring aesthetic made people less interested in the album in general, while other concepts such as the Froot of the month (with a set of images representing each song) made people interested in every song. I think a good cover and aesthetic can lead you to enjoy more a product that maybe is not \"that good\" in itself. I know I have been drawn to some songs or albums by their incredible covers, and for sure I was more receptive to the music after seeing the nice visuals, even if it wasn't my prefered music style (see Wasteland, Baby! by Hozier, or Three Dimensions Deep by Amber Mark).",

As you might know if you have played like this, the families get bigger and bigger lol, so it's hard to know everyone. But as of now, I have tried to maintain a little of control in all of the households, although I always play one as a main.\n\nIn another household which I haven't played much, the sims had a cute little alien kid. Honestly, he is amazing and he is a big friend of my \"main\" sim. I realized today though, and very late I think, that the kid doesn't show up in my sim's relationships anymore. I have found that his two parents died of old age, and the game doesn't let kids live alone. He still appears in my family tree though.\n\nI would like to know, is my sim lost/deleted? Or can I find him some way? I can't go back to recover him because I would lose days worth of gameplay. He has a Sim ID, but, when I try to summon him, it doesn't work. But maybe I can do it another way or I have the wrong cheat? As an alternative, I have a copy of him as a toddler in the gallery, so I could recover him - but I don't know if I can restore his relationships, Could I connect this \"Kid 2.0\" to the family tree somehow, using cheats? Or maybe link the new kid to the old ID? I am at a loss because I have never done anything similar. Thank you in advance."

I mean, I have read about small cages and that is obviously so bad because they don't have enough space, but if I find one/make one big enough will it be okay? I only see people here posting about their hamsters in plastic containers so I am confused by that.\n\nAlso, I don't have lots of space horizontally, but if I give the hamster three or four floors vertically, would it be okay? Or do they need to have all the space at the same level? I was thinking of building some different floors to give the future hamster more space. With lots of bedding too ofc! But if it's somehow wrong, I will do it as you say, wise redditors.\n\nThank you for your future answers!"

I can't remember much of my life in general, except for the bare minumum I'd say.\n\nI'm still able to lead a normal life at the moment, but it makes it slightly harder. I'm scared that it'll get worse and it also just sucks in general..\n\nSo now I'm wondering how to resolve this? It's been going on for a while now. I've started dissociating around 2-3 years ago and the memory loss started about 1 year ago I'd say. It defently got more frequent/worse over time.\n\nI'm not in a place where it's possible for me to get professional help, but I'm scared to leave this unresolved.. \n\nCan anyone please give me Tips on how to get at least a little better?

We have the corded velvet which we really like but the color doesn't fit, so we're going to go back and try out some more fabrics. One of the things we're thinking about was the bronze wombat fur. \n\nMy biggest hesitation with the furs is their longevity.  How they hold dirt, how they hold pet hair, and how they stay soft over time? We have a few of the fur blankets and they definitely aren't as soft as when we  first bought them. I heard that if you wash it it'll return it to its original softness?\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this? Do you have pets? How does the hair clean off and does the fur hold in dirt and other things? How long have you had it? Is it still as soft as when you bought it or do you have to keep washing it and does it actually help?\n\nThanks everyone!"

I didn't know I needed one, but now that I've had my eyes opened, I'm hoping you can help me make a decision. After trying it out I did a little research and I'm torn between the RS and the s and the different year models. Namely the 2020, 2019, and 2018. The price tag on the 20/20 RS makes me cringe a little. Could I afford it? Yes. Do I want to afford it? No, and I probably won't. I've seen some 2019 speed triple s, and those are much closer to my price point, are they about as good? For a little background I want to be able to take multi-hour day trips as well as just popping around town. I doubt I'll ever be on a track.\n\nRight now it's basically a brand new 2020 speed triple RS for the full 16,500 or 2019 speed triple s ( brand new) for about 11,000 plus shipping the bike across the country.  \n\nThoughts??"

                "body": "Since there is a growing trend of conspiratorial spread among Muslim communities, and there is no general consensus and discussion among Muslim scholars, as a Muslim myself I always in cognitive dissonance about this topic. There is no compilation regarding this topic. Hence researching for Islamic views toward conspiracies would be difficult for those who are skeptical about it  (If possible spread it to social media, let's reach more people to vote on the opinion poll)\n\n**PURPOSE OF THIS POST**\n\n* I just wanted to make a post at which for those who are curious, about Islamic views toward conspiracy theories, would find the answer here.\n* This post is also intended to be scholarly, so **bring forward your arguments here**.\n* I don't want to be in any controversy, so **debate and argue with ethics and manner**.\n* And remember, all the point of views stated are... well point of view. It is not necessarily that a point of view is false, and the other is true. Instead, the **arguments that cogent and sound can be considered as strong arguments but not necessarily true**.\n* Since this topic is controversial, arguments based on Islamic epistemology is required to tackle this polemic.\n\n**MY VIEW**\n\nRemember this is only my opinionated argument, which can be neither true nor false.\n\n* I support conspiracies but take it only with a grain of salt and more sided into expostulate it.\n* I respect any conspiratorial views about anything. Conflict and polemic between Muslims about this topic are, for me, irrational since we as humans have their own subjective point of view about anything.\n* I see conspiracies as an eminent threat for Muslims to become more successful since I argue that discussing conspiracies would not bring any practical benefits even if we know about it. At the same time, we are wasting our time 'researching' for the uncertain and dubious truths of conspiracies. I guess it is better to spend that time reading the Quran.\n* The Islamic-epistemological argument of mine: On a [paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2w4uk/) written by Dr. Mohammad Manzoor Malik titled *Introduction to Informal Logical Fallacies from Islamic Perspective*, he suggests that \"*To know the truths which are not revealed, Islamic epistemological guidelines stress on the methods of certainty, discouraging guessing and conjecture\".* And he adduced the Quran 49:12 to support his argument. He relates this to the informal fallacy of *Argumentum ad Populum (Appeal to the People or Appeal to the Majority)* \\[in section 3.4.1, Chapter 3\\] since conspiracies are spread to the community through hearsay evidence from others. Just because other people believe it is true, it is not necessarily true.\n* Further, conspiracies are appeal to authority and Islam supports this as a valid fallacy in epistemological guidelines. He stated \\[ibid, section 3.4.1 Chapter 4\\] that, *\"On the next level are those who should follow the right authorities. Islam gives very high importance to knowledgeable people.\"* He continued that  *\"The statements and arguments of knowledge should be based on clear evidence, sound reason, and proper use of senses.\"*\n* I argue that some conspiracies are mere speculations (*conjecture*) because of the curtain of truths of those conspiracies are not revealed YET. The *clear evidence* argument is really a statement that could refute conspiracies as not in line with Islamic-epistemological guidelines.\n* Secondly, an [article](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/justin-parrott/finding-truth-in-the-age-of-fake-news-information-literacy-in-islam/) from Yaqeen Institute classifies conspiracy theories as a form of misinformation. And adducing the Hadith: The Prophet \ufdfa said, *\u201cIt is enough falsehood for someone to speak of everything he hears.\u201d* (Sahih Muslim) to support the idea.\n* The adduced article also argues that \"...*when exposed to dubious information, caution is warranted*.*\"*\n* Either way, I also argue that conspiracies CAN be discussed if only we don't exaggerate it to become facts - or worse treat it as facts. Or obsessed with it. Or relates any event(s) into a conspiracy! Despite the correlation of those events could be coincidental. Conspiracies are good for midnight talk or something that would give us chills, but take it with a grain of salt and don't take it so seriously.\n* For those who are on the pro-conspiracy side, I argue to take it with a grain of salt, not really obsessed with it, not reasons with conspiracy all the time, and respect the anti-conspiracies' view on the conspiracy. **And treat what you believe in moderation!**\n* For those who are on the anti-conspiracy side, I argue for all of you to be moderately cautious about SOME conspiracies because it could be true somehow. And respect pro-conspiracies' view on the conspiracy. **And treat what you believe in moderation!**\n\n*and Allah knows best*\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n\\[An objective conclusion of mine will be formulated after 7 days\\].\n\nFor me, this topic is *inconclusive*. I suggest reducing conflict and polemic by treating conspiracy in moderation ([*wasatiyyah*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation_in_Islam)) - it does not matter if you either on the pro-conspiracy or the anti-conspiracy side - would be ideal. Both must treat their views in moderation. And I have stressed this into my arguments. Unless and until there is a general consensus among Islamic scholars regarding this topic.\n\n**OPINION POLL**\n\n* The opinion poll... well is just an *opinion* so **do not adduce** your arguments based on this poll.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Terminology:\n\nAnti-conspiracies doesn't necessarily mean that those who are on that side are rejecting entirely on conspiracy, instead, they might present their arguments that are not conspiratorial and expostulating conspiracies.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/gkxm58)"

Because my experience with AI art is meh, the art is too abstract and some details are weird (I use the free ones like Wombo though). It's so hard to write the prompts so the result will be something I have in mind. So yeah, how to better write prompts to produce specific art with specific styles?

My parents never expected any material things for me, they just want me to be a good muslim so we can be together again in Jannah. After they found out I left islam, they said this is the hardest disaster for them. They love me so much so they don't want me to burn in hell forever. And it makes me feel like a shitty human to cause so much pain to them just because I choose to believe differently. I don't hate or get angry at my parents for trying to convert me and guarding me. It's because of this rule they act like that. Maybe if kafirs won't go to hell forever, they will not be as depressed since even muslims will go to hell for cleansing first anyway. \n\nThanks for listening to my rant."

Because she notices I became lazy with my shalah. And I have tarot cards. But today, just a few minutes ago, I wasn't being careful with my phone. And she snooped around, opening my chat with my also ex-muslim best friend. In that chat, I shit upon the concept of islamic hell, I said I think it's ridiculous. She also saw I still play with my tarot cards albeit the digital one because she took all my physical tarot cards. Oh my sister also tell her about the tarot and my other unislamic activities.\n\nShe told me that I'm still young (19f) and I don't know enough about the real world that I make misleading conclusions. There are amazing imams or scholar that are smarter than me, so it's wrong to think Islam is wrong. She said that I'm too egoistical, heartless, and don't care about my family that I dared to leave islam. She said that I'm too spoiled, that I already have everything good in life and never feel the horror of life so I need to seek something outside islam. \n\nWell I've been ex-muslim since March now, I don't believe what she said because I'm already sure with the path I took. But it hurts that she came to those conclusions, especially with the I don't love my family. Well okay, nowadays I'm colder and keep my distance from my family since the time my mom took all my cards and other spiritual things. It's more because I'm trying to protect myself from them knowing (which I failed miserably) and it hurts she took the things that bring me spiritual enlightenment more than islam. Also because I'm just generally unemotional and not too affectionate. But I really love them and grateful for having a great and healthy family. That's why I still follow my mom's commands. I pretend to do daily prayers, I still memorize quran, wear my hijab, join halaqah every week out of respect. \n\nI managed to say that I still believe in Allah. Well I do still believe in God, not the islam one. I also said this is just a phase. And I guess that comfort her a bit, that I'm not a hopeless case and she still can save me from hell fire. But one of the thing that matters the most to me, my freedom to atleast just believe and think, is gone. I'm trying to not be so down about it. Sometimes I wish I'm strong and brave enough to leave home, but I'm scared my life will fall apart and I don't have anyone to lean on. And If I do leave, I want to leave in good terms with my family. Now, I just pray to universe that I meet a man that I love as soon as possible and get married. That's the only way I can be free honestly. It's not only about financial support, I already have my own income although not much. But emotional support. Even though my family thinks I'm distant and act like I can do everything myself, I'm not. I'm not strong enough to live alone. I have friends of course, but they have their own life and worries.\n\nIt sucks that I feel like I can't trust my family again. But I'm just going to keep my faith there will be something good stored for me. I can't let myself get depressed or my life fall apart because of this. I'm going to keep my act until I managed to get married. Thank you for reading my long rant."

I hate that I need hugs to calm down. I feel needy. I shutdown and struggle to communicate. I cry a lot.  \n\nI am also a trans man, and while I am learning that that's okay, I also hate myself. My parents sent me to conversion therapy as a teen, and I still live with the effects of it today. All I could think of while I was overwhelmed was the thought \"you deserve to burn in hell.\" I feel inadequate for having something smaller than a micropenis, even though my girlfriend assures me that she likes it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nand it's not like I don't have hobbies, I am an avid weightlifter, and artist. I love writing, and I love building. I am learning freeCAD to make parts for some robotics, and I love pokemon and magic the gathering cards. I love legos, and I am great with animals. \n\n Anyways all this to say loving yourself is hard.

Special or something like that. An insight of what terrible things could have happened to the characters and the world they live in is not just very interesting and emotional, but also makes the happyend sweeter.\n\nThe same doesn't stand with canon sad endings and happy alternatives. Unlike the above, it doesn't make the original concept more emotional and sorrowful, but instead ruins the mood and the atmosphere, the original show and its ending created. Here the best choice I think would be to have a really cheerful and happy scenario BEFORE things go downhill."

They appear as separate words in formal written usage, but they are written almost like suffixes in most instances. \n\nFormal literary use: \"Kelimeler kifayetsiz idi.\" \n\"Words were insufficient.\"\nColloquial use: \"Kelimeler yetersizdi.\"\nMeaning the same thing but the word for 'insufficient' is changed to it's equivalent for non-literary use. \n\nThe word 'idi' turns into the suffix 'dI' ('di', 'd\u0131').\n\nSimilarly,\nFormal use: \"Elma ile armut.\" \n\"Apple and pear.\"\nColloquial use: \"Elmayla armut.\"\n\nThe word 'ile' meaning 'and' turns into the suffix '(y)lA' ('le', 'la', 'yle' 'yla'). \n\nIf the formal form of these words are written in a daily setting, texting let's say. It sticks out as weird. Maybe more with 'idi' than it is with 'ile'. \n\nHowever, recently it is increasingly getting popular to use the colloquial forms even in books, disregarding the analytical use, but I doubt it would change so quickly since most belles-lettres have it.",

Find a room asap and sit in the furthest corner away from the door that is also out of the line of sight. Behind a desk or a shelf is also good too. Close blind, turn lights off. Barricade the door with anything you can. Stay silent, including your phones. If someone says they are the police, don't open the door, it's not worth the chance of it being the shooter. The police will deal with getting to you themself, or wait for confirmation from a dispatcher or something.\n\nLast resort, fight for your life, it is up to you. Be aggressive. Startle them. First goal is to disarm the shooter. Break their attention by throwing things at them. Chairs, textbooks, pencils, literally anything. Take the gun farr away and have someone restrain the shooter. Be aware of any additional shooter.\n\nThere are probably resources online from like homeland security or something that can be more in depth tbh.",

Especially when it comes to getting through work, and staying sane and sober. \n\nDoes anyone have any words of support, or where I can find solid sources of support for this Titan of challenges? I've used patches, Nicorette gum, Allen Carr's Easyway, smoking cessation apps and texts.\n\nShould I simply try again with all of these methods combined?\n\nThanks"

Flash forward to 2019, I got into a car accident due to high speed and inebriation. Chose to do rehab and it didn't stick. 2020, I got hospitalized for psychosis due to losing good connections and taking bad speed. 2021, got convicted for my DUI. I decided to go sober for real after the psychosis.\n\nExcept cigarettes. They're slowly taking over. I quit 3 times this year, each time got a bit further but never more than a few days. I figure, each time, that I'll stop soon, 10-15 smokes a day help me get through the day along with the mental illness, pills and their associated effects, and sobriety.\n\nI'm sucking these down and I'm convinced I'm actually doing a lot of damage to my circulatory and respiratory systems. My extremes have bled out into cigarettes.\n\nI used to do ballet. I used to be a runner. I ran a half-marathon (yes, I felt good writing that).\n\nI need to quit. 6 years now. And this year it's become the new scare of my life, after everything that's happened since 2017 when I started hallucinating and got the first of many diagnoses.\n\nI'd appreciate any resources, encouragement, anything... advice, similar stories. I strongly dislike AA, NA and I've used a stop-smoking app. I have Allen Carr's book but so far, he's saying things I used to just think to myself as a kid about my own mother when she smoked, and it makes me feel worse, like this is fate or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I'm getting paranoid about turning into a prune.

Similar to shame or disgust maybe? I\u2019ve kind of pinpointed that it makes me feel \u201cnaked\u201d all of a sudden, so maybe vulnerable. It goes away quickly, I just want to know why it happens. I have MDD and OCD, and an unspecified anxiety disorder. Is it anxiety? Sometimes it happens after I\u2019ve just eaten, but I don\u2019t have any symptoms of an eating disorder otherwise. Other times it just happens totally unprompted."

It seems like this was triggered when I got a cold last week and my ears kept feeling plugged. I\u2019ve had this one in the past, then it went away for a while, and now it\u2019s back. Any tips?

So I just got a cheap motherboard that has everything I need and should be fully compatible with all my parts (ASRock B660 Pro RS). But now I'm reading people say that B660 boards are supposed to be used for lower end i3 and i5 CPU's and for an i7 you should get a Z690. Apparently a B660 board can't overclock a 12700K (this is not a big deal to me though, I can go without overclocking as I want to keep my build silent and the default clock speed offers me plenty of performance already). But maybe I'm missing something. Is it possible that my B660 is bottlenecking my CPU in any other way? Another thing I find suspicious is my CPU seems to almost never exceed a temperature of like 40C, and usually hovers around 30C (I do have a pretty overkill Noctua CPU cooler though, but still). Even under heavy stress testing. I've tried testing it with Cinebench and it gives me a score of 18700 while most 12700K owners seem to get around 20000-22000. I'm not sure if this is caused by them having Z690's or something else. Whats the issue here?"

And if you look at Santa Catarina, the result was way more in favor of Bolsonaro (70%). Of course people there would be feeling harmed by the decisions of people they never saw and are miles away but for some reason can influence their region. Just like Northeastern would be right to feel harmed if Bolsonaro won. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, it's easy to understand why these people are angry, and why this country is fucked up (and it's part of why I defend municipalism, but that's another story)",

You won't be able to find any non-bised opinion here, only right wing (the ones with downvotes) and left wing ones.\n\nAs I see it: 51% of the population voted for Lula, 49% for Bolsonaro, and many of those votes were simply a way to don't let the other candidate win, \"the least worse\" instead of \"the best\", so it's not like most people actually like the president. Besides that, with exception of the Northeast (my region) all the other ones voted for Bolsonaro, creating a situation where many states feel like they didn't consent to this whole shit. If you add to that Moraes's abuse of power, it's pretty simple to understand why the country is \"in a war\".",

Doing slow easy efforts for long times brings out adaptations that change as a function of time spent running. This will lead to overall running economy, and acts as the primary base for threshold and intervals.   \n\n\nThen there's strength endurance that helps running economy. A good way to build this base here is through maximal strength training. Doing so reduces perceived exertion at an effort, and makes your body tolerate lower intensity fatigue better. Basically to make running more aerobic intensive instead of being more of an anaerobic load, you need maximal strength work.",

My question is why is there an arbitrary deadline to sign a new extension almost a full year before the player hits free agency?  Especially when they get another window at the end of the season and can offer the same length and money?  Why not allow that extension to be signed all the way through the season?\n\n---\n\nI was thinking about the  Ayton situation.  The rule is that the 2018 picks had to be extended by Oct 18th.  But now they're unable to negotiate an extension until next offseason?  Why does it work that way?  Im sure there was some kind of reason for this rule, but whatever it is I can't see it.  Seems hard to fathom.  \n\n\nLike let's say Ayton comes out and blows the doors off the league for the next couple months and Phoenix changes their mind and are willing to offer him the max.  But now they can't?   Seems like this creates all sorts of problematic incentives.  Particularly for the player, who is now incentivized to play way more safe and sit out even for minor injuries because his income will depend so much on how healthy he is at season's end."

I want to make her happy but I don't want her to think I have an agenda. Well not a romantic one anyway.  She'll get it next week on her birthday.\n\n##Little background in case it matters\n\n* known each other for like 20 years\n* we were never a thing and it was never discussed. I had a crush on her for a little while and she probably could tell, but I never brought it up because I knew she wouldn't go for it.  She always dated guys a lot older and better looking who wore shirts with collars and weren't broke like I was.\n* lost touch over the last few years as we kinda grew up and apart, she got married, then we both started our \"grown up\" careers. Saw each other gradually less and less, until we stopped seeing each other at all. I think I heard she got divorced a year or two ago but honestly that's not what's prompting this   \n\n\n##The long version of why I wanted to get her something\n\n\nEvery year since we grew apart, she sends me a text message on my birthday. No big deal or anything, right?  Except when she sent the last one it dawned on me that I never did the same for her. And then I realized I didn't even know her birthday. I think I did at one point but I forgot it somewhere along the way. So ofc I started to feel really guilty and embarrassed about it. Its been at least six years like this and I just realized it.\n\nSo a few months ago I just told her that, and asked her when it was. She told me and acted like it was no big deal but, idk she got kinda curt and I kinda feel like it bothered her.  I mean its hard to say because we're not really close any more but we used to be.  \n\nThe more I've thought about it the more it feels like our friendship was always kind of a one way street in terms of, she did nice things for me but I never really did for her. At this point it has fully dawned on me how self-absorbed I must have been all these years.  \n\nI mean I wasn't *not* nice but other than customary things like taking a heavy bag from her and stuff like that, I can't think of one nice thing I ever took the initiative to do. In like 20 years. \n\nI remember her doing a lot of favors for me, like giving me rides and letting me borrow money and stuff (my tender male ego forces me to point out that I make a lot of money now, but yes I was basically destitute up until 4 or 5 years ago). I remember she bought these good seats at an NBA game and surprised me with a night out (I'm a huge fan of the local team). I think she might have bought me my first weed pipe. I also think she convinced her sister to go out with me though that's never been confirmed (we went out a couple times but ultimately we were too different and it never went anywhere).\n\nI can't remember doing anything nice like that for her. I think maybe one time I told this crazy dude who was bothering her to get lost (I mean like literally crazy, probably homeless). I guess that's the closest but it's still just a reaction, not the same thing. The more I've thought about this the more I wonder why she was even friends with me.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo... yeah.  With her birthday coming up, a gift seemed like a good idea and relatively lavish one seemed like a better idea.  And I put in the note something about trying to ameliorate my guilt by bribing her with treats (or something like that).  But now it feels like way too over the top.  So I thought I'd ask around.  Might not be too late to cancel the order or change it to something else, like maybe cookies or something."

I think my fear began when I was in elementary school and my mom saw a tornado warning on the news, telling people to take cover in a basement. I remember her frantically grabbing our animals and running with me next door to my grandma and grandpas basement. I knew that if my mom was scared, it was probably pretty serious, so I became terrified. A couple years later, when I was in 4th grade, I had an assigned seat next to the classroom door and I overheard my teacher on the phone with somebody, talking about how there was a tornado watch. This was the first time I ever experienced an anxiety attack. I started hyperventilating and crying and my face and hands went numb. The worst part was that I didn\u2019t know what an anxiety attack was in 4th grade, so I thought I was dying. Fast forward to the current 21 year old me, and I still have an extreme fear of tornadoes. I have a carport at my house, where my 2 bunnies live. I was sitting in there, watching TV, when a tornado warning went off on my phone, saying that everyone in the area needed to take shelter and that there was \u201crotation detected\u201d. I proceeded to throw up over 10 times in a row while having an anxiety attack. I called my boyfriend and when he answered, all he could hear was me hyperventilating, rapidly saying \u201cthere\u2019s a tornado\u201d over and over, while throwing up. I know that the main way people get rid of fears is through exposure therapy. But, how am I supposed to do exposure therapy with tornadoes? Go storm chasing?"

You can tell that all these restaurants low on staff are probably pretty bad places to work because at my job, literally every single employee wants to come back and they can\u2019t. I feel like I got lucky working there because everybody gets along really well and I know for a fact that that\u2019s pretty uncommon. It\u2019s just so frustrating because we can do events, but a lot of people aren\u2019t booking events, especially companies, which is 90% of our winters, because of COVID. Typically, banquet servers will go on temporary and low unemployment in the summer (getting like $100 a week and working 1-3 days per week) because that\u2019s the only way the industry survives the slow seasons. Nobody would work there if they had to be flat out broke for 4 months out of the year. The fall and winter is when it was typically busy. But, because we\u2019ve been shut down and had to be on unemployment this whole time, we can\u2019t keep getting unemployment to be able to stay at our job, so we\u2019re gonna have to start a whole new one. I\u2019ve been working at the same place basically since I started working and I\u2019m just so overwhelmed and sad that I have to leave. I was really close to my old boss at my job and he died last summer, which absolutely destroyed me. But, being there makes me feel a little bit closer to him because of all the memories I have of him there. It absolutely breaks my heart to think that my days at my job are over. Honestly, the whole place might be completely shut down by next summer. I feel like that place is almost like my \u201cchildhood home\u201d even though I wasn\u2019t a child and it\u2019s \u2018just a job\u2019. My heart is breaking, I\u2019m scared and overwhelmed about this and a lot more. I just feel hopeless."

                "body": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a UK biomed graduate, who has recently decided to go into CS. My main intention would be to hopefully go into bionics/biotech, so as to be able to combine my knowledge of both fields. Moreover, I am paticularly interested in advanced limb prosthetics restoring function to amputees. \n\nSo far, I have about a year's worth of Python knowledge and I have enrolled in an MSc in Data Science and AI, which I wil be graduating from in 2024. \n\nMy concern is, trying to make the best out of the time that I have available to acquire and improve the necessary skillset for this career path. However, I have struggled to find info on the sort of skills (other than AI and ML)  that I would need to pursue bionics. \n\nAlso, given how early I am in my career, and the likelihood of me getting a CS job is quite slim, I'm wondering how I could develop said skills and make them marketable, as I am concerned that I won't be taken seriously if I only have coding in my free time on my CV and not a job position. Moreover, my current employer will be making me redundant in 8 months, so I'm really hoping that I can get another bio job, or even a CS job before I get kicked out.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. What sort of CS skills should I be looking into for Bionics/Biotech, other than Python, ML and AI?\n2. Is there any way I could make myself more hireable to future employers, if I only have small amounts of experience, but still showed potential with my MSc? Also do you guys know of any sites with job postings for this level of experience?\n3. Would it be useful, if I managed to get a CS position in a different background, say graduate consulting, cybersecurity, or fintech, if it just meant having something on my CV?\n\nLast question is for anyone that has gone down a similar route to the one I'm planning. How did you get into biotech with CS? What sort of things did you do to get into your career and how did you progress?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance"

Please let me know if this is allowed or not, as I couldn't find any rules saying otherwise\n\nHi all,\n\nI'm  25 and I am currently struggling to determine the next best step for me  in my career. I graduated from a UK university with a degree in  biomedical sciences and have several years of clinical lab experience as  well as currently developing experience working in an industrial lab  due to a job change.\n\nI was  interested in research, but haven't  been able to be put into a position  to carry out much as at the moment I am struggling to find a job or a  PhD  that would accept me with my current qualifications and experience.   Therefore, I  have been looking into getting a Master's in the hope  that I can learn, but also be appealing to prospective employers. My  interests lie mainly in nanomedicine, neuroscience, drug delivery and  surgery,  as well as learning to code.  Another one of my interests is  also business.\n\nThe reason I  decided to go for this Masters' is because I don't want to just end up  in a lab for the rest of my life (no offence to anyone who does)  and I  would like to be able to work and achieve a higher position with a  higher salary, and/or set up my own business.\n\nThe  reason that I was looking into this Masters', was that I believe that  it could provide me with the research experience and knowledge needed,  as well as being able to learn other subjects from the optional units  such as bioinformatics.  The reason that I have my doubts, is that from a  google search, there are mixed reviews from people who have done a  similar degree and have stated that it had been a waste of time for  them. As I am investing time energy and money, I'd really hate it if I  came out at the end with a Mickey Mouse degree that offers nothing in  return.\n\nPlease could anyone  provide me with some insight into this Masters' degree and also any  career advice for someone who is trying to set with his career, but is  worried about what he wants to do in life?\n\nThanks in advance"

Not only that, but how is it your daughter's fault that her fianc\u00e9 didn't ask for your blessing, which is such an archaic, misogynistic thing as it is? People don't do that anymore.

Whatever happened in the past was clearly enough to make her not want any contact with you, and even without all the information, it's easy to see why. Arguments, kicking her out, overstepping the boundaries she set by obtaining her phone number. It doesn't really matter that you're cutting her out of your will either. It's a low blow to use that as a threat to manipulate her, as if you think she's going to beg you to reconsider and want to talk to you to stay in it. You're not done with her; she was already done with you.\n\nTo add, on top of all of that, you shouldn't be putting your younger daughter in the middle of things.

I wasn't sure about posting this here (not really your typical London sub post, after all), but I'm glad I did because everyone has been really helpful. I know a lot of people are moving within London these days, so hopefully it can help some other people as well.

When I moved in, the estate agency told me that British Gas had installed meters incorrectly, and they didn't know which meter was mine, so the meters were all hooked up to a main meter, and the landlord was paying the bills until they got it figured out. I started getting bills from Octopus Energy, addressed to my first name only, because apparently the previous tenant somehow got my name and gave it to them. The estate agency told me to just send them the copies of the bills for the landlord to pay. This isn't in my tenancy agreement, but I have saved every e-mail and only deal with them in writing. In June, the estate agents had people come out to match the meters to the flats. A couple of neighbours confirmed that they had the same agreement and have had no issues like this. I started getting late bills in either May or June and contacted the estate agents. They said that the meters were sorted out and matched to our flats, so I was responsible for the bills going back to when I moved in in March. (They did not tell me it had been sorted and that I was responsible for them until I asked.) I paid \u00a3115 and switched suppliers to E.on because I wasn't happy with Octopus and their customer service and never wanted to be with them to begin with. In September, I paid another \u00a3227 for the 'final bill.' I knew it was too much and complained about it, but I figured I'd pay it to just be done with the whole thing since I had switched suppliers anyway. In October, I received yet another 'final bill' for \u00a3465. I have not paid this one. I'm afraid that if I do, they'll conveniently come up with another 'final bill,' but even if I did, I would be paying for more than I know I've used myself, as I already have.\n\nIt would be impossible for a single person in a tiny flat without a lot of energy-consuming things to use that kind of energy. I don't have a TV, don't use the heating, barely cook, and I turn switches off when not in use. I even turn off the hot water tank after I shower. I argued this and was told the bill was correct. There was a lot of back and forth, and I eventually filed a complaint with Ombudsman Services. They just finished investigating today and ruled against me, so I now have to pay the \u00a3465. They did also order Octopus to credit me \u00a375 because they offered that as a 'goodwill gesture' for the breakdown in service/communication. I sent loads of evidence - all the e-mails with the estate agents and Octopus and everything else I could think of. I got a smart meter with E.on in October, which shows my usage is normal for a flat this size. Octopus' 'evidence' was a screenshot of a meter reading they said the previous tenant sent them. The screenshot was clearly from the inventory report, and there's no date on when it was taken or anything, so we don't even know if the previous tenant immediately switched to Octopus or if he was living here a year before switching or whatever. I tried to argue this when I responded to Octopus' comments to my complaint. My own inventory report just shows a picture of the room with all the meters and no readings.\n\nI figured out that the most likely thing to have happened was either that the reading sent to Octopus as their opening reading was an old picture (I'm 100% certain it came from an inventory report) or that the 'main meter' the other flats were hooked up to was actually my meter, so it would show higher usage. I'm not sure exactly how many flats are in the building, but the way it's set up I'd guess that they could have maybe 10 flats or so that were hooked up to this 'main meter.'\n\nI contacted the estate agents a few weeks ago and told them about the ombudsman complaint and my theory about the main meter, but they said there was nothing they could do and that they couldn't give me any information they hadn't already given me (which was basically just that the meter number). It's absolutely insane that I would be charged nearly \u00a31000 for just a few months of energy from Octopus, and I feel like no one is helping me. Now that I've lost the ombudsman complaint (I can't imagine I'd win an appeal based on their 'evidence'), and the estate agents are unhelpful (I did ask them for the landlord's contact details to make direct contact), I'm at a loss. Would it be worth it to contact a solicitor (if so, what kind?) to help me with this, either in dealing with the estate agency or Octopus? What would happen if I just didn't pay the bill? I really don't know where to go from here or if I have any legal recourse. I'm tempted to just pay the bill, but the whole thing feels like a scam to me, and I can't really afford to pay that kind of money for something I didn't even use myself."

The dream didn't explicitly state the size of the organization, but essentially hinted that it was at least a decently sized organization that had power and influence. My organization was one that essentially solved problems from the shadows. Despite being the ruler/ leader of the organization, no one knew my identity. I wore a black cloak with a black plastic mask to hide my face. Also, a lot of people had powers and superhuman abilities, but I was the strongest of everyone in the dream.\n\nSome of the top members of my organization and I went out to eat, however, since they were dressed as normal civilians and I was wearing a cloak and mask, we sat separate from each other not to arouse suspicion. I sat in some discrete corner that was behind a wall from the third-person point of view that was focusing on my subordinates. One of them was a woman stuffing their face with a greasy cheeseburger, getting grease all over their face while the rest were talking while slowly and cleanly eating fries. All of a sudden everyone froze except for two people- some tall guy and the subordinate with the cheeseburger. The dream didn't focus on where I was but it was assumed that I was fine.\n\nThere was a reason why 2 people didn't freeze- the tall man was a powerful mind controller who was mind controlling everyone to freeze and the woman who quickly figured out that grease on your face blocked out the mind control. My subordinate quickly began rubbing greasy napkins all over everyone else's faces who then started rubbing grease on other people's faces. A quick scene showed me rubbing grease on the faces of the people behind the wall which then cut back to my subordinates who had finished rubbing grease on people. It then became known to real me (me me, not dream me) that the reason we were eating out was to catch this guy and attempt to stop him from committing crimes while also trying to recruit him.\n\nI then rushed in to take care of the man, but he pulled out a small, faintly-glowing blue crystal and used it to increase his mind control powers. People began to freeze up despite the grease and even I started having some difficulties moving, though I didn't freeze up but it was just like it took a lot more force and effort to get my body to move. The mind controller then said to me, \"Now I'm on your level.\" The dream went from third-person to first-person. Because I couldn't move easily, I couldn't fight back. The man knocked me face down on the ground and then pushed his foot into the calf of my right leg. I remember in the dream feeling a lot of pressure on my leg and some pain.\n\nAnother woman from my organization then unfroze and ran to the man and started yelling at him, but the dream didn't let me make out any of the conversation, but the real me then found out that the mind-controller was the older brother of the woman that unfroze. The dream cut to me laying on the ground with me resting my chin on my hands which were supported up by my elbows resting on the ground. The dream also made my mask slightly see-through for me to see that I was grinning and obviously happy that the siblings were getting along. I thought about how great sibling bonds were. The woman then convinced her brother to stop and join our organization, but just for what seemed like fun, he stomped on my leg again but for a longer time than before. The dream played that scene multiple times before I finally woke up.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was laying on my stomach and I could still feel the pressure on my right calf until I decided to get up. It was kind of a strange dream, since I didn't seem to even care that I was being beat up but boy was I happy to know that the two siblings were getting along just well and that they had a great family reunion. It was also weird waking up and still feeling the pressure in my leg"

There were these two other bounty hunters/hitman who were hired to kill me, however, my parents had also hired them to protect me. I knew about both of these things, but I sort of just went along with it.\n\nAt first, they were acting more like guards than hitmen. Though they did notice something different about me- in this dream, I apparently had a sort of aura about me that essentially mesmerized people into doings things for me or not doing things to me. One example, in the dream was that I was exempt from paying tax on products (yeah, don't ask me why the dream decided to put a lot of emphasis on that factor, despite it not being put to use that often). They also noticed that that was the reason why they were acting more like guards to me rather than hitmen. Also, since my \"aura\" (I don't really know how else to describe it) was constantly activated on those two, it started to make dark circles form under my eyes.\n\nEventually, the two hitmen were finally able to start working as hitmen. They chased me and I essentially ran from them. The dream did a quick time skip to a point when all 3 of us were in the middle of some desert town and we were all completely dehydrated and tired. I ended up passing out in the sand and the dream showed the two hitmen noticing how big and dark the dark circles under my eyes had become. In which the dream cut to a flashback of my dream mom telling the two \"guards\" about my ability and that it exhausts me quicker than everyone else, but also that I had gotten used to the exhaustion, so when I finally pass out, it would be at the same time that normal people would pass out at.\n\nEventually, there was a local owner of a auto repair station who came to help us. Him and his employees sat us underneath some shade (and since the hitmen were too tired, we made like a silent truce). Then, in order to rehydrate us all, instead of offering the free water bottles I knew his nearby auto repair station offered (I knew this because I remembered this place and this owner and his employees from another dream, though it wasn't located in a desert then), they gave us pieces of cacti to attempt to get water from them out. The other 2 hitmen didn't think nothing of it and attempted to get water out of them (to no avail). I looked at the owner and his employees and through the cactus piece at them knowing full well that they gave away free water bottles.\n\nWe then moved into the auto repair station where they finally decided to give us the water bottles. We drank a lot of water, but then the dream ended. It was an interesting dream, but at least it wasn't as gory as my last dream I remembered."

My dream brother's wife decided to be half human, but she naturally had less of an urge to eat others so she became a librarian in this organization focused on solving problems caused by unknown creatures, like my species. It wasn't specified in the dream what species I was half of, but I wasn't human. I looked like a human though, but since I didn't have the urge to eat humans, I joined that same organization as a hunter. My dream brother chose to be human but he also had the greatest urge out of all 3 of us and he was very strong and powerful, making people fear him.\n\nEssentially, my dream brother was the antagonist in the dream. He ended up staying in some abandoned house on a busy road. He would eat the people that would either walk or drive near the house. When he would eat people, their bodies would become sort of patch-worked and they would walk around outside the house as like his mindless servants.

Luckily, for me, I was in no danger because I was the same immortal species as my dream brother and we have no urges to eat one another.\n\nAt first in the dream, I along with one other coworker had to break into some military facility and get some documents. I think the military in my dream were kind of corrupt and wouldn't give us the documents we needed despite apparently being on the same side, so we had to get those documents through other means. My human coworker dealt with getting me inside and outside and it was my job to sneak through the facility and steal the documents. Because I wasn't human, I had incredible strength and power, making sneaking along rooftops and quickly getting by people easy. I managed to steal the briefcase containing the documents and get out. I still don't know what importance those documents served, but they had importance to my dream brother's case.\n\nI then decided to go and try to talk to my brother to get him to stop, so I made a trip down the road, putting down the not-so-human servants along the way. I went inside the house my brother was in and we talked for a bit. The talk didn't get my brother to stop and he took on a more terrifying form and continued on. I went back to the organization and I had the idea of asking his wife to get him to stop. While my brother did like me, he had a special spot for his wife. I went to his wife, the librarian of the organization who could also control her urges, and asked her for her help. She was nice, but you could tell that she didn't act human since she wasn't. I also didn't act like the species I decided to take half of until I \"die\" and I also didn't act like a human but both my brother's wife and I didn't act like monsters like my brother.\n\nMy brother's wife agreed to help and try to talk him out of it, but right as we left, I woke up so now I don't know what happened after that. Also, you would think a dream where I watch people be eaten alive and turned into monstrous servants would be a nightmare, but it wasn't scary somehow so that's why I'm not putting the flair as nightmare and instead putting it as long dream."

You\u2019ll not be able to conduct any further business using PayPal. \"\n\nAfter contacting customer support and giving them an ID and told them the \"account explination\"  (taking art commissions.) I got hit with what seems to be an automated response:\n\n    Thank you for contacting PayPal regarding your account Limitation. I can see your account has been issued a parting ways Limitation.\u00a0\n    \n    We appreciate your interest in PayPal; however, our decision to leave your account in a permanent limitation status is final.\n    \n    PayPal reserves the right to limit access to any account reported to be involved in possible fraudulent or high risk behaviour. In the event of a dispute, PayPal will seek to recover the funds from you by debiting your PayPal balance and, if there are not sufficient funds in your PayPal balance, PayPal reserves the right to collect your debt to PayPal by any other legal means.\n    \n    Due to the potential risk of chargebacks and other risks of funds reversals, your balance will be held for 180 days from the date of the last payment that was received into your account. At that time, any remaining funds will be available for withdrawal.\n\n\nIn case any of this is considered \"suspect\":  \n\\-I made the account in a linux virtual machine (heard linux is more secure and a scraper bot would likely not think of searching though a virtual machine)  \n\\-I made it about as soon as I send the link (the comission was 15$ but I asked for 5$).  \n\\-I might have mistyped the name by replacing the Romanian special characters on the ID with their non special counter parts (\u0219 with an s ,   \u0103  with an a). If they had a problem with this I assume they would just refuse the ID and tell me the names don't match and to double-check for typos."

                "body": "My bf (23m) and I (22f) met on IG when I was in a horrible place in every possible way (sort of like an existential crisis) and he had a mindset and persona that was very new to me so I was fascinated by him and drawn to him. He was exactly what I was looking for at the time because I was looking for someone who could give me \u201canswers\u201d. He helped me with my state and gave me a whole new perspective that contributed to a huge change in me including that of religious and political beliefs (which I still have). He was condescending at times but I had zero self worth at the time and thought I deserved it. So you can guess what happened when I went from being extremely lonely to having \u201cdeep\u201d conversations with a guy everyday. I got attached to him and idolized him (I had never even seen his face). I would think to myself this is the guy I want to marry (oh, naive me). \n\nWe were friends for two years but would gradually only talk twice a month due to \u201csecurity\u201d reasons since he\u2019s in a strict shite country. (We\u2019re both middle eastern just for context and we have the same ethnicity but our families are of different, very opposing, religious sects). After a while I noticed he was being flirty with me and thought he was trying to indirectly tell me that he likes me. He started paying a lot of attention to me so we called and talked and played everyday. I was waiting for him to directly tell me that he likes me but he didn\u2019t so I did \ud83e\udd21. so we just went on from there without even dating and got into a relationship that had me hating it and confused for so long and one significant reason being that he was not the same person when we were just friends. He was very depressed at the time so I blamed our messy relationship on that and thought that I should \u201chelp\u201d him until he gets better. But it was just him showing his true colors. He was holding up the LVM flag and I was completely blind to it. \n\nSo in the course of our relationship we had a lot of ups and downs and I broke up with him a few times for petty things he said/did. He always talked me back into it. I decided to stay with him if he changed for me. And he did get better. But I was still uncomfortable and always felt like something was wrong. That\u2019s when I came across this subreddit. Upon reading the handbook I realized how many things were wrong and how both of us were LVs. I had made up my mind on everything but one thing that was bothering me was that he is not a bad guy and has improved a lot since the beginning but I had to cut the relationship off regardless, because of how drained I was feeling. even though he was supportive too but he would still disappoint me sometimes and I lost attraction gradually.                                                 \nAnd btw, we\u2019ve never met in person. Ever. Which is another huge mistake we made. \n\nBesides all of this, we have our families in the way. My parents would never accept me marrying him. So even if we were a flawless couple, we would still have a huge problem ahead of us. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s worth going through all that trouble for. \n\nThe feeling to end things became very strong in me and now here I am single and clear headed after 1.5 years of on and off confusion. \n\nAnd that\u2019s all thanks to this subreddit. I\u2019m very grateful for you queens\u2019 hard work and care. It didn\u2019t help me solely relationship wise, but also personality and lifestyle wise. I never realized how many of my problems were due to low self worth. I\u2019m definitely not an exact HVW right now but there\u2019s been a significant shift and it\u2019s ongoing. \n\nTL;DR crushed on a friend for very long, got into a relationship LVW way, read the handbook, had a reality slap, broke up with my manbaby."

It's been a very hard road for me (including a broken engagement over this) and I've been waffling back and fourth for a few years now while I recovered and learned to cope with this new normal of mine. \n\nI have never for a moment doubted wanting to be a mother, but now the anxiety of whether or not I want to risk saddling any biological children with a complicated (incomplete) diagnosis is heavily weighing on me. And now that I've met someone I can envision having children with, it's making everything that much more difficult. \n\nAfter some googling I see that there are migraine panels and genome sequencing that can warn me of risk factors. My father was adopted, we have no idea of his family history. My half sister (on my father's side) is the only one in my close family who has any form of migraine, though it is an entirely different presentation than mine and closer described to what she experiences from her own biological mothers' family. So maybe it's just me. Maybe it's not hereditary at all...but maybe it is. And I just feel like I can't even think about having bio children until I know.\n\nHas anyone tried this? What were your experiences or results? Did it help you make a decision or would you have made a different decision had you gotten the test earlier? Any help and advice would be appreciated"

                "body": "I don't know how to deal with this. I don't even know if I'm asking for advice or venting, so I'm sorry in advance if this is a mess. \n\nI'm sure you can guess the beginning: my dog is reactive. I got him as a pup with my (now ex) fianc\u00e9 when I was newly diagnosed with several severe chronic illnesses. I couldn't get out of bed I was so depressed and scared to leave my apartment. It was bad. I was constantly afraid that if I overextended myself, I would trigger a pain spike that would leave me incapacitated for days...so I just wouldn't do anything at all. My ex kind of enabled me, honestly. He was fine with me just giving into the pain. When he was still trying to be supportive, I told him I had to learn to live with this \"new normal\" instead of just allowing the illnesses to live for me. It took a bit to figure out the best way to move forward, but I decided I wanted a support dog. For those who have done the research, they're crazy expensive and since I was still between multiple diagnoses, I knew I wouldn't get funding for a specially trained one. \n\nMy father used to be a dog trainer and he had taught me a lot, so I decided to save up my money, get my own dog, and train him myself. My then-fianc\u00e9 was all for it. We'd always planned on getting a dog anyway, it was simply my illness that had delayed us. So, we started searching. \n\nI knew the moment I saw my dog, Fen, I'd be taking him home. He was perfect and sweet and calm for the first week. When he got comfortable with us, he showed more of his personality and he is a *very* hyper boy. And not just \"puppy\" hyper, but the most hyper dog I've ever owned including breeds like boxers, labs, and huskies. But he is also one of the sweetest, most loyal dogs I've ever known. And he is *smart*. Crazy smart, even. Fen was a lot of work, sure, but nothing overly surprising once we started exercising and mentally stimulating him enough. \n\nBut he got me out of bed. \n\nHe got me out of the house. \n\nHe made me start smiling again. \n\nI know some people don't agree with the idea of getting better for others, particularly animals, but my dog made me *want* to get better. For the first time I had someone who didn't accept the diagnosis and assume I couldn't function. He *made* me function. I love walking him, I love taking him to the park, I love playing with him and being active again. It was the first time I felt hopeful. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9, however, didn't seem to understand the work that goes into a puppy and was a very stern disciplinarian from the beginning. At first I thought it was just him mean mugging our dog because he was inexperienced...and then I heard and later saw him hit my dog. He gaslit me at first. He made me think I was crazy and had misunderstood what I'd witnessed.\n\nFen changed after that, he started to become reactive, unfortunately before I was able to come to my senses, leave my fianc\u00e9, and move out. It was really hard. I could barely support myself and starting work again was rough when I was still so ill. Plus I was still in love with my ex when I left and I was for a long time after...but anyone who could hurt a dog isn't the one for me. Period. \n\nThen, when we were finally living alone, a neighbouring dog got loose from her yard. This dog stalked us all the way down the street and attacked me while I was walking with my boy. Fen rose to the challenge and was able to battle the dog away from me, thankfully leaving me with no injuries, but it took MONTHS of intense training to try and help him through it. In the mean time he lunged at anyone walking past, anything that moved...it was horrible. I reverted back to being afraid to go outside. Afraid to walk. But not for my illness' sake...now (at least in my mind) it was for the sake of dog. \n\nStill, he's come so far. He's barely reactive around people on walks anymore. Strangers on the street compliment how hard I work with him during each walk. I took him to a special board and train program and they told me to take him home: he was already trained past the point that program could help him. In fact, they asked me why I didn't just take him back to whoever had trained him so well. It was all me. Still, I asked for private lessons to help learn to deal with the reactivity.\n\nWell, in one lesson the trainer bluntly announced that **I** was the problem. Even as he said it and I felt defensive, my dog snapped at him for the first time in the half hour we'd been there. \n\nIt was, it *is*, my anxiety triggering him.\n\nIt wasn't surprising to hear it though. I'd feared as much so it was sad, but not surprising. He said my dog isn't anxious, just insecure and he's very connected to my anxiety. So I worked on it. I try every day to work on it.\n\nHe's great on walks now...but other things have gotten worse. He's reactive at the dog park. No one can enter my apartment. No one can come close to me. No one can enter his space. No one can enter *my* space...\n\nUntil I'm gone, or course. He's fine meeting people if I'm not there, or I'm at work and he's with other family members. He's fine when others walk him or babysit him as long as *I'm not there to see it*. He's fine when strangers walk into the backyard with my roommates as long as I'm not the one in the backyard with him. \n\nI just don't know what to do. I've gone to two trainers now and their advice is the same: my anxiety is the issue and I need to fix it. \n\nBut *how?*\n\nI am trying so hard to work on my anxiety, but he still senses it before I can battle it down. Honestly, he has the potential to be a perfect therapy dog in that way...if I can get my shit together. \n\nIt's just devastating. I feel like I'm letting him down because I'm weak. Because *I'm* the uncontrolled one. But I don't know what else I can do to make it better: I'm medicated. I'm trying. But it's been years and my dog still can't behave in public as he does in private. He is so incredibly intelligent, he is so well trained and sweet. Just...too aware of me. \n\nI feel so lost and overwhelmed. How do I control something he senses before I do? How can I override my own instincts more than I already am? I feel like my anxiety has gotten so much better than it was when this all started; sadly, it's still not good enough to help my dog. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I've tried everything I can to help him...but I have no idea how to start when I'm the entirety of the problem."

They\u2019re essentially letting the modders from the community do all the work while they\u2019re an entire corporation overpricing small packs. I and many other simmers would not be playing sims 4 without mods. \n\nAlso let\u2019s be real here, from not having the original base game with toddlers and pools (all things EA had in the prior sims games), it is proven that they are decreasing with time. While Paralives is a different game, it offers so much just from the videos we\u2019ve seen alone. It is also another upcoming life simulator, and sims has always been one of the most popular life simulator games, so Paralives will be inevitably be compared to them.\n\nAnd people are entitled to opinions, that\u2019s what comes with the gaming industry. People like games and people don\u2019t, they are allowed feedback if the creator wants them - they can use other games as examples and comparisons, but it doesn\u2019t mean the creator has to take it in. The sims franchise has and *still* is ripping people off. Players are excited about Paralives because it\u2019s a new life simulator they can try out. I won\u2019t get started on the fact that they\u2019re just a small indie game company who has already surpassed a lot of what the Sims 4 (with the entirely of EA) has taken years to do.",

But now that I have done a lot of healing and got in touch with who I really am I feel like I have made the wrong decision. \n\nThere is a feeling of deep regret and like I have been robbed. If I was in a more healthier place , if I had been able to be my true self back then what decision would I have made? I feel like Im too old now to pursue something art related because I need to grow up and earn money. \n\nThe regret is suffocating at times. When I browse through instagram and see al these artists and people expressing themselves freely I feel envious and a sense of deep shame. I picked up drawing and writing again to appease the inner child that feels betrayed by me and I hope to find some healing and get to a place of acceptance of the decisions I have made. \n\nWe cant turn back the time unfortunately but we can give us what we need now.

Legs started shaking just like last time but today it was a little more intense and It felt like the shaking was trying to reach my lower back. I was a little scared but decided to just surrender to it.\n\nAt the 15 minute mark the shaking slowed down and stopped completely and I thought \"So this was it?\" Before my body suddenly really slowly started swaying from side to side. I was confused because it didnt feel like I was shaking but I let it happen and just watched my self being moved from side to side. Gently and calmly and I let myself enjoy it before it dawned on me. This felt like I was gently being rocked. Just. like. a. little. baby.  I realized that my body was  trying to comfort me! It felt like it was telling me that it loved me, that it cared about me, that it wanted me to be safe. \n\nAnd anfter the initial feelings of love and calmness I felt sad because for the first time I became aware of how much hatred I had for my body.  I hated it because it never did what I wanted it to do.  Because I felt like my cheeks went red too easily and it only did that to expose me, humiliate me. I felt like my body was against me, that it hated me because it got scared too easily. I hated it for getting anxious for the most insignificant things. I hated how my heart beats too fast and my hands gets shaky. I hated my voice never being loud enough.\n\nI hated it and thats why I only ever acknowledged it when standing in front of the mirror. The only love I gave to it was for the way it looked and even this one thing that I liked about it I attributed to myself because it felt like it was my own accomplishment since I work out and try to \"tame it\" so it stays in shape. I realized I never actually thanked it. For all the hard work, for all the miracles that it performs for me on a daily basis. For all the times that I forced it on a treadmill and continued to run although it was telling me that it needed rest. I took it all for granted.\n\nBut today my body told me: You hate me, but I love you. \n\nFor the first time in my life I feel cared for. Like there is at least someone, something that cares about me. That loves me.  \n\n I never would have thought that I would benefit from the practise this fast. Im really looking forward to future sessions and new insights."

Counter UAVs are utterly useless atm simply because they're way to easy to destroy. Counter UAVs are easily visible floating somewhere in the middle of the map, are relatively close to the ground and endure 2 Sniper Bullets. Maybe they could find some middle ground for both of them.\n\nI also thought about decreasing the scan tick rate of the UAV heavily, so the location is not updated as often. Though that sucks because it basically buffs rusher play styles even more which I personally don't like, and so doesn't IW.\n\nThen there's possibly also the reduction of the UAV duration.\n\nMy suggestion would be to nerf the UAV by making it less accurate. With that I mean something similar like Battlefield has. When someone shoots you actually don't see the exact position but just a rough semi-transparent red field/circle on the minimap. The enemy can be in any specific spot within this field/circle. \n\nUAVs are especially strong in this game because of its low TTK and slowness when it comes to ADS. The one who already aims before a gunfight starts almost always wins the duel because the other guy just can't react + ADS quickly enough to be able to stand a chance. A rough circle would reduce this issue because you can't exactly be sure if the enemy is behind the corner or the exact spot you're anticipating he's coming from.",

I played about 10 matches of Bounty but it seems like SBMM still hasn't kicked in for some reason. What I also found weird is that the overall match scores tend to be relatively balanced.\n\nAlso, when I'm playing 30/10 there's 2-3 people in my team that completely suck and maybe play 4/18. It's somewhat similar on the enemy team. This seems more like the classic Team based matchmaking to me.\n\nI didn't test the standard modes yet after the break so I can't tell if it's mode specific or if there was some type of skill evaluation wipe for my account. Or maybe the mode and the spawn system is something I can work with very well, or it could also be my different choice of weapons. Though the k/d difference is just way too big, my guess would be that it has something to do with (missing) SBMM.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else here is experiencing this."

Though, I wouldn't say that I have a bad sense of reaction (I have a lot of experience when it comes to competitive shooters and MOBAs, generally gold-platinum ranks). I block fairly well (though I still have some difficulties blocking Orochi attacks for example), feint, counter, know my own movesets, mix up fighting patterns.\n\nI have a severe lack of knowledge when it comes to move sets of heroes I don't play so it's hard to adapt the fighting style when it comes to playing against those heroes. I understand that this knowledge is incredibly important on higher ranks but I expected to get at least to high silver without this knowledge (works in MOBAs at least which require a lot of knowledge regarding enemy movesets).

I'm normally not a person who is overly confident in my ability to \"read\" people or in my intuition since I always keep possible biases in mind.

I feel like I've incorporated parts of my Anima quite well and wouldn't describe me as feminine, especially outwardly (though I guess my personality type naturally shifts this on the more feminine side). \n\nI've oftentimes read about possible projection traps and after a video I was especially wary.\n\n[https://youtu.be/yEYuQMVbB2s?t=333](https://youtu.be/yEYuQMVbB2s?t=333) (Idk why the dude made the video so creepy)\n\n5:33    This is the part that makes me doubtful\n\nAnd here a comment I wrote under the video which concludes my actual question\n\n> I'm having some problems with this ending part. There is a specific, tiny set of woman to whom I'm romantically attracted to and know that they have potential to be a life long partner after one look at them and their eyes, it's true that those can be perceived as fairy-like at first sight. Bubbly, agreeable, enthusiastic, deep, warm, cute, bright. I tend to show those traits to my friends from time to time (bubbliness, warmth, lots of physical affection, energetic) despite me being the opposite normally (I'm an INFP while those other traits might be typcial for some ENFPs). I've had lots of dreams about exactly that type of girl in my dreams. The personality traits and looks from the girls in the dreams were varrying, though they still overlapped. In the dreams I'd casually interact with them, when I look at them (especially into the eyes) I feel a deep connection that seems romantic at first but way more shackling to the soul than the primitive variant. The last dream I had about half a year ago was when I somewhat \"freed\" her from something and the girl approached me (though me being a bit scared/worried at first) and embraced me (the fear went away shortly before she embraced me).     \n>  \n>**The thing is, I was actually quite confident that I'm not negatively manipulated by my Anima and that I'm just very idealistic in my standard regarding women (someone who understands my soul in a twin-flame kind of way) and that I realized and integrated those traits fairly well. Do you think this might be all a farce and I'm basically at point 0 of Anima development? Is she tricking me or is she showing me the way to a romantic soulmate?**"

At the same time, Native American enrollment, once as high as 1 percent, dropped to 0.11 percent in 2021, the brief said.  \nWhat\u2019s more, fully one-quarter of underrepresented students surveyed felt they did not \u201cbelong\u201d at Michigan, a 66 percent increase in a decade, the brief said.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html)",

I have just received my first box today and I\u2019m excited to see how the food taste. \ud83d\ude0b\n\nRecently I have been considering trying out Hellofresh, however I don\u2019t want to start using their service if it\u2019s too difficult to cancel later on.\n\nAlso does HelloFresh have a customer service/support number that I can call? I\u2019ve used Hungryroot before and I was so surprised to find out they don\u2019t have a phone number to call, they only had an email, which meant I had to wait a couple of days before getting a response. That\u2019s not a dealbreaker for me though, I\u2019m just curious.\n\nI just want to know what I\u2019m getting myself into before giving it a go."

Thanks again for the help guys, I appreciate it.\n\nHi I just wanted to know if there\u2019s a way to get your galaxy back after someone creates a false report, claiming that the name of the galaxy is offensive? For context, I personally don\u2019t play the game my dad does, so I don\u2019t exactly know how the game itself works, I am just trying to help him. My dad told me he named his galaxy \u201cGenesis 1\u201d and it got reported as offensive, which led to it being removed. Is there a way to restore the galaxy, or at least report the false claim? Thanks in advance for any help and advice.\n\nUpdate: I got more information, he can still access his galaxy if he puts the galaxy on private. I\u2019m still curious about how the reporting works on this game."

People always speak of man and his \u201cpsychology\u201d as though there were \u201cnothing but\u201d that psychology. In the same way one always talks of \u201creality\u201d as though it were the only one. Reality is simply what works in a human soul and not what is assumed by certain people to work there, and about which prejudiced generalizations are wont to be made. Even when this is done in a scientific spirit, it should not be forgotten that science is not the summa of life, that it is actually only one of the psychological attitudes, only one of the forms of human thought.\n\n\n\n\nThe ontological argument is neither argument nor proof, but merely the psychological demonstration of the fact that there is a class of men for whom a definite idea has efficacy and reality\u2014a reality that even rivals the world of perception. The sensualist brags about the undeniable certainty of his reality, and the idealist insists on his. Psychology has to resign itself to the existence of these two (or more) types, and must at all costs avoid thinking of one as a misconception of the other; and it should never seriously try to reduce one type to the other, as though everything \u201cother\u201d were merely a function of the one.This does not mean that the scientific axiom known as Occam\u2019s razor\u2014 \u201cexplanatory principles should not be multiplied beyond the necessary\u201d\u2014 should be abrogated. But the need for a plurality of psychological explanatory principles still remains. Aside from the arguments already adduced in favour of this, our eyes ought to have been opened by the remarkable fact that, notwithstanding the apparently final overthrow of the ontological proof by Kant, there are still not a few post-Kantian philosophers who have taken it up again. And we are today just as far or perhaps even further from an understanding of the pairs of opposites\u2014idealism/realism, spiritualism/ materialism, and all the subsidiary questions they raise\u2014than were the men of the early Middle Ages, who at least had a common philosophy of life."

I learned the different strokes and could do flipturns, dive, and dolphin kick, but couldn't keep my head underwater consistently or do quick breaths. I also constantly felt out of air as of having little to no cardio-respiratory endurance. I threw up after most practices as the training was very hard (I did get a chicken sandwich afterward most times though, so I was alright lol). \n\nAnyways, covid hit and I stopped going, but I'd like to personally swim on my own and see if I can improve from where I was (I'm now a senior by the way). I was wondering if anyone could recommend drills, how much to swim, or how to work my way into improving."

Al primo anno essendo tutto online l'esame era molto facile a crocette al computer da casa, mentre ora \u00e8 un esame scritto a mano di 3 ore. La cosa mi ha demoralizzata tanto e non sono riuscita a stare costante con quello che dovevo fare e mi sono ritrovata al 3\tanno con ancora da dare l'esame di Giapponese 1.\nHo pure anticipato altri esami del terzo anno per poter dedicarmi alla lingua ma non riesco, non so da dove iniziare, cosa riprendere e cosa fare. \nUn paio di settimane fa quindi mi sono detta \"ok \u00e8 ora di decidere: cambiare lingua e laurearti in tempo oppure continuare con questo \u00e8 andare fuori corso?\"\nHo tenuto conto dei pro e dei contro: \ndovevo di nuovo dare un esame di cultura (perch\u00e9 ho gi\u00e0 dato cultura giapponese 1 con un 30 e lode) e anche cultura tedesca 2, gli esami che ho anticipato sono inutili ormai perch\u00e9 erano esami a scelta e ho pensato di mettere cultura giappo come uno di questi (per il voto) \nCome pro invece il tedesco l'ho gi\u00e0 fatto e mi \u00e8 stato detto che sia lingua tedesca che cultura tedesca 1 siano abbastanza facili. \n\nCos\u00ec ho deciso di passare al tedesco, lingua gi\u00e0 studiata (poco ricordo lol) alle superiori e ho l'esame settimana prossima.\nCome detto prima Tedesco 1 sembra facile come esame quindi spero di farcela, il problema dicono \u00e8 Tedesco 2 che \u00e8 un bel po' complicato.\n\n\nUn'altra cosa, il tedesco mi fa schifo. Davvero ho sempre odiato la lingua, alle superiori non avevo i voti migliori perch\u00e9 appunto non ero interessata e mi rimpiange il cuore vedere i miei vecchi appunti di giapponese, che mi \u00e8 sempre interessato come lingua.\nPer dall'altra parte ho i libri, ho tutte le lezioni dei prof e quindi giapponese me la posso studiare anche per i cazzi miei con calma senza l'ansia d'esame (che penso che sia la cosa che mi blocca)\nPoi vivo a pochissimo dalla Svizzera e quindi il tedesco \u00e8 davvero molto utile, magari studiando lo sempre di pi\u00f9 mi inizia a piacere?\n\n\nVabb\u00e8 spero che questa mia scelta sia la scelta giusta. Scusate per il vent e mi piacerebbe tanto sentire la vostra opinione a riguardo.\n\nEdit: volevo aggiungere che con tutti gli altri esami sono apposto, come detto prima avevo anche anticipato qualcosina.\nIl problema sono gli appelli scritti, purtroppo abbiamo un appello scritto a semestre, che se non lo passi una volta \u00e8 molto facile finire fuori corso."

That is harrasment, it is not exactly the same). It also doesn't seem 'grossly discriminatory' -- it is not an appropriate thing to say perhaps (I actually had a teacher in sixth form who made sexist jokes constantly, but it was clearly a part of banter and he got back just as good as he gave!), but this idea that someone needs suspending for that seems in itself a bit sexist to me; I mean, given that the girl bullied him, she's clearly resilient enough to handle that comment lol.\n\nI used to be bullied a little in school, I am now 21. To be honest I think reporting it to the teachers as I had and handling it 'officially' actually made me less confident and more insecure. I don't think an administration should be stepping in to manage the social lives of young teens when it comes to rude comments. Instead they should step in to teach things like resilience training and socially pragmatic ways to deal with intimidation, because in the real world, adults actually have to deal with problems by directly engaging with and confronting each other... not by going to the police and wasting authorities' time.\n\nMy key point here is that all of this daycare style management just locks the part of them that is supposed to be growing into a self-sufficient adult in eternal infancy.",

Moving forward, I will avoid the MBTI branding in its entirety as it seems to have muddied the waters anyway.

Rather, I am applying a personality system that **draws from the same conceptual roots as the MBTI (Jung's 'psychological types' ) and also sorts people into the same 16 personalities, but with deeper theory applied directly from Jung and other places such as CognitiveType, with more rigorously defined concepts.**\n\nIf I say \"Jungian Typological Evaluation\" instead, it is highly likely that nobody will know what I am talking about, whereas everybody knows what the MBTI is. 'MBTI' has monopolised the public image of the deeper theory. This is, however, sourced from Jung and other places, *not Briggs or Meyers*.

That 50% dodge AND 50% spell resistance is just perfect for tank characters.\n\n* Rogue: Legionnaire Scout/Bard/Ranger\n\nLS has the best passive for rogues with that +10 in STR and CON, SoC is still helpful, Wolves have overwhelm so they're perfect for mob fights and bears are very useful against bosses. Not to mention they make wonderful blood sacrifices.\n\n* Mage: Blood Mage/Battlemage/Spirit Healer\n\nFrom what I recall, blood uses 20% less than the mana requirement for skills, add the wonderful items that makes it so that you use 25% less blood and since friendly fire is 50% less for an imported Warden, makes Blood Magic just incredibly OP. If there's still enemies lurking, just switch off blood magic and use draining aura, also I believe that stoic also include the damage taken due to friendly fire so you get wonderful synergy between the two.

A big problem in the states is that housing is an investment more than it is a home. It\u2019s something to be profited off of.\n\nHousing is a basic human right, and just like many countries provide free education, universal healthcare, I think we could do something similar with housing. \n\nIf you want an example of a place that does public housing really well, look at Vienna, Austria.

I don\u2019t want to claim that suffering is what makes art special, but I do wonder how the art would differ when a lot more of the population is either essentially self actualized, or very much in their way there.\n\nWould the art then get substantially more existential? Why does life exist? \n\nMaybe portraits would increase. People would feel closer with their communities and hence paint the people around themmmore often. \n\nMaybe it would get increasingly more abstract? I know to some extent that\u2019s a trend in art, no? \n\nI think it may also be possible that less art is made, and people make their life in general more \u201cart like\u201d if that makes sense."

Also being over 30 sucks bc when I was younger, I thought I still had a shot at a glow up, so I worked out for a few hours daily, got really lean, stayed weird looking... and now that I don't have the kind of energy to go balls to the wall to the point of literally passing out every day at the gym (I've still worked out consistently but I'm getting weaker and weaker no matter what I do), I don't even have a leanness advantage and it's making me so depressed. Worse is I make almost no money and so by the time I can afford cosmetic surgery I'll also need botox and a facelift and will never get to enjoy a \"hot girl\" phase that attractive women get in their 20s/30s."

I want to try to build a relationship with the cat because I love animals and I am currently a dog owner and i want to learn how to get along with my aunt\u2019s cat! \n\nThe cat is a siberian mix and my aunt took him in when he was a kitten. Problem is that everyone in her home never had the time to physically be with him so he grew up disliking human touch. This makes him very fiesty and slaps others and potentially scratch and bite. \n\nI hope someone has an answer to this!"

Yukkins is my first suitor in the game so idk how much better saizo and shingen would b. I literally BALLED my tears out at his death OMG \u0b87\u0bf0\u0b87 I alrdy seen so many spoilers about him dying yet I didnt expect myself to end up tearing up for him. Istg yukkins is making me set my standards for men irl way up high, hes just a cinnabun.\n\nAlso, one thing I love about SLBP is that its not purely about romance, smut, etc. and it involves so much death, and more genres. I dont see a lot of mobile otomes that has the suitor dead, and srsly the writing is golden. One thing I want to say abt SLBP aswell is that compared to Ikesen, the world doesnt purely revolve around MC, LI, and other suitors but there are many extra characters that have so much personalities. I am very in love with stories that brings so many personalities at once and hope I get to read more like that!"

It feels like I can't sit down and enjoy a movie or play games comfortably anymore, because it *feels* like I always have to do something else. Which is true, technically. There's always something work related to do (especially since I freelance right now), or there's always something more important to do around the house like prep for cooking, or cleaning my room, or what have you. \n\nI've been thinking about when was the last time I didn't feel so restless 24/7, and it was probably high school. Summer holidays I could be doing nothing at all but playing games on the computer, eating, and sleeping. And I'd feel content. \n\nBut doing something similar now would probably make me feel so guilty and stressed. \n\nThe only times I would not feel restless is after I've had a full day of work & exerting energy, OR sometimes after meditation.\n\nWould like to hear how you guys deal with restlessness, if at all."

I can't figure it out, I relate to all four of them, depending on which gear I have shifted my mind into. \n\nHere goes:\n~\nI don't think I could bring a revolution to completion,  I can barely finish a novel, but if your want someone to start a revolution and plot out its path; I'm your woman.\n~\nI'm not looking to influence anyone. In personal relationships I'd prefer to leave people the way I found them. But I'm compelled to express myself through my work and hope it will enrich everyone it touches in the  most impersonal way imaginable.\n~\nIn general, I'm an unpleasant person to be around.\n~\nWhen people say I can be loud and annoying, they're missing the fact that I'm ALWAYS annoying.\n~\nI'm compelled to challenge my beliefs about myself. A few weeks ago I said: wow, I really have two black thumbs. The next day I had rented a large plot of land and started a vegetable garden and I can't even remember doing it.\n~\nThe first thing I realized about myself was the undeniable conviction I was born from the universe. When I found out this was technically true, I vouched to always trust my feelings.\n~\nI love the idea of the little man conquering monumental injustice. That shit chokes me up inside in the most delicious way imaginable.\n~\nI'm attracted to the sad, to melancholy. It's where beauty resides.\n~\nI can't be bothered with chores. I'm always seeking to get rid of more stuff so I don't have to clean it and I can spend more time off inside my head.\n~\nI don't give a shit about your opinions on fleeting matters. Show me who you are through your music, your writing. Make me fall in love with the real you, the person you can't be in every day life. Rip my heart to shreds and put it back together better than it was before. This is how you'll live forever.\n~\nI hate people judging me. But I have to put my work out there and have it criticized. Not doing so hurts me too much. I need to know my worth.\n~\nComfort is my biggest enemy, I don't want to touch it with a ten foot pole.\n~\nI'm so subversive it's ridiculous. I want to overthrow anyone, big or small,  who wants me to do anything.\n~\nI'm a great delegator, I always know what steps need to be accomplished in order to get anything done. But I can't do that for myself.\n~\nBalance and moderation breed mediocrity. I'm either 100% in or 100% out.\n~\nI don't need anyone for anything in my life. If you're in my life, it's very much deliberate. It's because I want you there.\n~\nI'm the worst kind of romantic. The kind with all the most sappy notions and only the ability to put it into their work and nowhere else, forever longing for it to be another way.\n~\nI amaze myself with my impulsiveness. One minute I've made a plan for saving money, the next I'm booking tickets to the other side of the planet. \n~\nI have always had a deep seated feeling that I'm different and somehow destined for greatness. At the same time, I think I'm worthless and good for nothing, a deadbeat destined for the gutter. My life has been an interesting blend of both outcomes.\n~\nFor someone so emotionally intense, I'm remarkably blind to what those emotions actually are.\n~\nWhat I'll be if my writing doesn't pan out? Actress or musician. The least creative thing I can imagine myself doing is being a chef for Heston Blumenthal or something, if I was capable of working for anyone but myself. The mundane is my worst nightmare.\n~\nEvery day I'm terrified of finding out I have nothing to say, that I'm a fraud.\n~\nI write because the pain of not writing exceeds the torment of actually writing.\n~\nI can't sell a paperclip to save my life. It's like, do you want the paperclip or not? Did you research if this was the best paperclip for you or not? What do you need me for? Any kind of selling feels inauthentic to me.\n~\nEverything inside of me wants to be a well rounded, balanced and reasonable, emotionally stable person. I was almost there but found out it makes for terrible writing. Fuck that.\n~\nI'm so concise and to the point, 95% of the writing I do is actually lengthening my writing into a novel.\n~\nI'm moody, unpredictable, irritable and emotionally inconsistent. I advise against being in any kind of relationship with me. I also wish someone would save me from myself.\n~\nI'm always torn between being logical and scientific, and letting my creative mind run away with me. I wonder what will happen when I finally kick all reason to the curb.\n~\nAbsolute truth is easy to recognize. It's either good for everyone and everything, or it's the most painful thing imaginable.\n~\nGoing vegan is the most peacefully subversive thing you could possibly do. You hit the corporations where it hurts the most, while living to an indecently high age and stopping your contribution to the destruction of the earth and exploitation of animals. All from the comfort of your home.\n~\nI have experienced most of the horrible things in my life before the age of 8. I like to think I came out unscathed, but I am inclined to believe that is wishful thinking.\n~\nI look at things objectively that should never be taken there. I keep dreaming about things that other people just want to keep firmly on the ground.\n~\nRock bottom is bedrock, never forget that.\n~\nI am incapable of understanding most people. The few I do get, I love with a passion for the rest of my life. They're my brethren whether they know it or not.\n~\nI prefer to be in control of everything and be responsible for it all. This is how you learn the most. But I'd be lying if I said that was the reason for my bossiness. In reality, I'm an insufferable control freak and you can't even tell because my life is chaos.\n~\nEverything that really resonates with me, embodies the same brand of intensity. It can be found across the spectrum. It's in certain kinds of music, TV show, novels, even sports, science and engineering. It's a certain kind of vision, it's really far out there. It's rare though, but when I find it, I live a little bit more and wish to die a little bit less.\n~\nI like the greats, you know. Bowie, Waits, Reznor, Musk, Cumberbatch. I don't do categories, they're all amazingly intense.\n~\nI'm the sort of person who listens to the same music, the same bands, for decades. I still listen to the same geniuses I did when I was 15, and they're still around too! Fuck, sometimes life can be really magical.\n~\nIn my work I like to explore male beauty. I don't think the world really values men in the way they deserve to be valued. They're supposed to be this thing, fit this mold that's not true to form. I find men very ethereal, graceful and romantic. I like the idea of the male muse. That's very much what certain men do to me.\n~\nI'm always researching something. I'm not joking. Whenever I tell myself to take a small break from either research or work, ten seconds later I've asked myself a question I now HAVE to answer and once I know it, I HAVE to use it in my work.\n~\nMy mind is a messy network of all the information I have gathered since I was 6 months old and only I know how everything connects.\n~\nI love competence. It's like crack to me. The idea that someone spent  thousands of hours on their passion turns me on.\n~\nI love the feeling of unreciprocated love. The ability to keep dreaming of what could be is perfect for who I am. Anything that really happens is less beautiful than what I conjure up and I want to taste that longing forever.\n~\nWhat it's like to be me? Imagine hovering about a foot above your head. You watch all the processes going on in that funny little brain of yours. You're judging everything that goes on in there. \"Ah yeah, we're going to have to change that\" \"You've got to be kidding me, that's not how you say that\", \"you want some redundancy with your redundancy?\" I'm always improving what goes on in there. I'm never in the moment. In fact, the idea of meditation scares the crap out of me.\n~\nYou will never get to know me by being my friend, not if you spent your entire life with me. You will only know me by being in my audience.\n~\nI'm not the kind of person you think of when you want to invite someone over for coffee.\n~\nI always feel like I have a more masculine energy than a feminine one.\n~\nI hate conflict, but I hate butchering of the truth more. Whenever I hear someone say something idiotic, I tell myself \"let it go\", but I never can. I HAVE to challenge them. I hate my racing heart, I hate the way it makes me feel. But I love the truth enough to bear the discomfort.\n~\nNot being able to sit with pain leads to very bad things.\n~\nI'm one, huge bad habit sprinkled with odd levels of self restraint and control.\n~\nI either want for the whole world to know me intimately or for no one to know me at all.\n"

I don't know how can I be the golden child for them and have them critise everything about me. \"Oh, you're wonderful when it comes to achievements in school, but you're ugly and we have to point out all of your little insecurities. I'm so smart, it's such a shame I don't like people. Oh, it's so great you got accepted into the university you wanted, but you're such an idiot for not living in college (even if you're staying with your best friend for almost no money)\"\n\nI got some new pants today (not jeans, but the cool \"dark academia\" types) and I loved them (and finally managed to find the ones that are not too long and they look good on my waist). And when my grandfather came over ('cause he always comes uninvited, because we live close and we're home either way) and wanted me to show them. And his first words were \"your butt looks so big in this, don't you wanna diet a bit?\" Like I know I'm not skinny, you don't have to point it out all the time (I'm not overweight, but I got a little bit of plus weight on my stomach area and my grandfather knows that I have IR and trying very hard to eat right). And right after that \"these pants are the best you got\". I got so upset that I haven't spoken to him after that (I locked myself to the bathroom, and after I came out I just put in my earbuds and listened to music). My father (his son) told him that it was not okay to say that but his only response was that \"I'm her grandfather, I can say that\" and calling me childish to get upset over that. \n\nI only have to wait 'till September, after that I'll be only home during the weekends and I'm pretty certain I can avoid him/them."

If everything goes according to my plan, I'll start university in September. \n\nAlso I'd prefer exchanging e-mails first, I feel more comfortable that way.

Do i say that planners take a cut? Do I put on my website smth like \"* Pirces may differ for specific dates\" or smth?\n\nBtw planners in my country do all the best and high end weddings and it's a great opportunity to work with them. \n\nFor a period of time I used to have on my website \"Investment between XX - ZZ\" but it wasn't helping at all, as people thought that their dream wedding fit in the XX price, so I now state specifically  \"XX\u20ac for 6h\" etc."

I was early on into the appointment doubting of wether I want to book them .\n\nThere was a small red flag that the groom said, he said \"when the party is on the peak, it's a good way to make the photographer stay 30 minutes extra to capture those great moments\" to which I replied very skeptical \"hmmmmm...yeah....?\" They immediately said that that's what other photographers have said to them but for me it was just the cherry on top.\n\nSo all in all, there is a possibility that they will call me to book ( I hope they got the message though) and I'm thinking of a polite way to decline (maybe just say I'm not available anymore without elaborating?) since brides can get angry over that. \n\nA local photographer I know has a negative review from a couple because he refused to meet them in person without having sent his pricing first. The couple thought it was an elitist move and felt offended and gave 1 star.\n\nHow do you usually decline after the consultation? (It's also a low season weekend)"

My fianc\u00e9 has also been my rock and I've made such amazing progress since we got together 6 years ago. He does just the right amount of pushing me but also comforting me when I need it. \n\nIt's because I got to a really good place in my life that I felt ready to tackle the next big thing, what I've always wanted to do, and go back to university to get my master's degree. It's been equal parts amazing and challenging. To pursue what really interests me I have the opportunity to go to Athens to write my master thesis this spring semester. Through talking with the professor there I've reduced my time there to about 2 months. Now that the date is coming closer I'm starting to freak out. I'm scared. I have social anxiety which really hampers my ability to make friends and talk to strangers. I always feel the urge to run away back to a safe place (home). Then I regret missing out on outings and making friends with my classmates. Now I'm going some place I don't know anyone. I'm afraid w/o my SO to push me I'll go full hermit and hate myself.\n\nSo I guess what I'm asking is, for people who have had to spend some time abroad alone, what are some tips you have to have a good time? Especially for people who are prone to anxiety/avoidance? I'm scared to feel very lonely. The language barrier also worries me a bit. I was thinking of taking pole/circus/yoga classes but idk if it will be possible without any knowledge of greek. If you've spent time in Athens more specifically I'd love to hear from you!"

I want to get a small part time job but I'm scared this is gonna make it hard to handle.  I can't consistently work and I just don't get why. Also energy drinks used it help me lots, but it made me very anxious, and I think my body got used to the drinks so now there's no effect. \n\nSoo all I'm asking if any of u guys have been thru this?

And that I'm going to marry a policeman and have 2 daughters with him by the age of 28. \n\nNow I've to tried to just ignore it and live the life I want how I want, but that life style is my biggest fear. I don't even want kids, especially a husband. I want to just live and travel and work on my career. Settle into independence by myself. And be surrounded by friends. Family just isn't for me, I find it boring and if I ever see myself going into that life, it sounds like I'd given up on the dreams I have now. \n\nI'm not very spiritual, but this psychic is crazy accurate and I'm trying to not let it get into my head. Someone looked into my birth chart and told me that I would do something that will change my life by 28, but she also said that I have sharp intuition and that I know better about my life more than anyone else.  So now I'm just really confused.\n\nTyping this out, it sounds even more stupid. Idk why this is so scary to me lmao"

I didn't really have any urges past the first few days, and the only reason I'm not continuing is becuase, well... it's nice. For those who believe that they need nofap to counter addiction or compulsive behavior, I highly recommend it. However, the reason I made this post was to say that nofap is not for everyone. If you're doing it as a test, that's fine. However, if you are insecure, or unconfident, or unmotivated and don't display symptoms of addiction, you're feeding yourself snake oil. Nofap isn't a miracle cure: it's a good tool to dig yourself out of a hole but it won't lift you past the ground. I've said enough, and now I'm going to delete reddit again. (I highly recommend it!) Good luck with nofap everyone, and stay strong!"

He keeps me on social media, likes, etc But still to me a stranger now after 2 years,\u201d\n\nyes and i actually do/did. but only if i truly believe you \u2018see\u2019 me and \u2018love(d)\u2019 me but we usually won\u2019t be as close just distant. not sure about your ex but for me it seems to be a repeating pattern where my relationships with people are that i can get really close to them at the start but at one point (after all the push pulls and feeling like i\u2019m being seen) it\u2019s just distant and we\u2019re those friends who just know a lot about each other but not that close anymore, just meeting once/twice a year to catch up on life which is pretty sad\u2026\n\n\u201cI also always wondered if he believes that I \u2018abandoned\u2019 him..bc I Never contacted again. He broke up after a great night on my way out, dont want to see you, can\u2019t do this, making it worse, need to heal and move on from our last brakup last year, you never gave me space (not true he didn\u2019t say what needed), etc\u2026Now that I now AT he must have really deactivated, I didnt\u2019 know what it was\u2026.But in any  case, since his main thing was SPACE and what he said..I listened..And tbh am surprised he never reached out bc we went from all on to zero in 1 night. I just thought it best to give that space despite me wanting to talk to him every single day he is still on my mind. Would you feel abandoned?\u201d\n\nyes i would feel abandoned. you see for me, the worst part is the self victimisation. i say people don\u2019t like the real me but i never show who i am. i don\u2019t initiate conversations or hangouts. i just wait for them to come to me instead. if i were your ex and since it seems like he still wants you in his life because you still have him on socials (for me i would delete contact n socials), i\u2019m actually secretly wanting and hoping you to start talking to me again. it\u2019s like a test i guess. if you really want me, you\u2019d try HAHAHAHA. it\u2019s super toxic i know. it\u2019s funny because our deactivation can be activated really quickly like a switch too\u2026 so when you initiate contact, we\u2019d be freaking happy to see you still want/like us. but i would say it\u2019s not good for you though if he doesn\u2019t wanna be better\u2026 i had to have a lot of alone time and space to be okay. and hypothetically if i were in a relationship (and i kind of felt like i was when i was really close to my best friend) i really had to ask her for space because i felt too loved and seen. it started from anger then i learnt o mature up n just ask for my needs and hope the other person is understanding enough to let me be.\n\n*also, when my best friend used to ask me if i was okay n stuff, i think it could be the way she says it too that makes me feel comfortable\u2026 she says it really politely but also at the same time not too bothered so i feel like i\u2019m not burdening her. idk it\u2019s weird, like an odd balance of care and not. to me she cares but also not enough to feel too heavy or burdened by me (or reactive in a sense). so she just moves on and acts like nothing happened when i ignore. that\u2019s just something different compared to anyone else who has asked me before. and i usually hate when people ask me those questions.",

                "body": "about 2 years and i\u2019m JUST starting to REALLY feel secure haha. took a lot of practising safety. showing my true colours more to those who i value and allowing for myself to accept and be okay with both rejection and love. i believe i couldn\u2019t practise this without people who are understanding of my attachment style tho. they catch me at my bs (pushes where they get annoyed sometimes and say \u201coh this cycle again\u201d) and that allows me to be aware that they know all this yet they\u2019re still with me and probably love me? but i know they care so it means something. \n\nat the end of the day no matter how much they prove to me that they love/care for me, i do believe that they have a hidden motive or that when i really show my true self they will leave me. and i\u2019ve learnt to be okay with that probability. i think i just learnt to be more grateful for the present than worry about the future. i had to learn to be okay being alone again but also be okay and appreciative of people when i am with them. i recently just exited the mode of leaning anxious and was gonna counteract with deactivation so basically i was really anxious that people didn\u2019t love me (mainly the trigger was my best friend not talking to me for weeks and it felt off) and i kept wanting their attention but also at the same time wanted to cut people off too because i don\u2019t need them lol when this was just to hide my anxious tendencies?\n\nEDIT: just wanna say when i get into the phase of \u201cnobody loves me. i\u2019m unloveable. i\u2019m going to disappear again and detach.\u201d i start to stop and look at the facts because my mind is wonky during those times right. so i would reread letters from people who\u2019ve written to me, read old texts and just reminding myself of situations that prove my mind wrong at that moment.\n\nalso when it comes to intimacy, i just try my best to be present and not run away (dissociate). my best friend helped me a lot in this. she\u2019s very patient with me and she shows subtlety in how she cares for me which i love. she doesn\u2019t force me to open up because i just find it so hard to\u2026 she would occasionally ask me \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d or \u201care you okay?\u201d and i wouldn\u2019t give her an answer and she would just leave it as that. she won\u2019t nudge me more. it just makes me feel like she cares because she randomly just wants to check up on me and i find that sweet and she still continues this even though i never give her an answer. \n\neven though i still have trouble expressing myself and being vulnerable, i try to once in a while. i do it better when all the lights are off or there\u2019s hardly any light. basically when no one can see my face. i just find it really scary and daunting when i\u2019m being seen when i\u2019m trying to be vulnerable. it makes me feel naked. i still stumble at those times with my words like when i say \u201ci love you\u201d and i really feel it, i genuinely feel like crying. or when i have to be 100% honest and what i\u2019m about to say or what i think of relates to the feeling of love/being loved, my voice just cracks up because that\u2019s how anxious and scary emotional vulnerability is to me.",

                "body": "One day, my boyfriend wrote a couple messages to me saying things like \u201cthis is not gonna work out, long distance relationships are a hoax\u201d and \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen each other in 7 months\u201d. \n\nWe live 300 kilometres apart but my job is mostly about staying at different locations all around my country and gaining experience. I would often arrive in his city, always remind him and also ask if he wants to meet up. First year of the relationship was normal and healthy, the problem was the fact that I was the one who would organise all the meetings, text first, talk and call first. \n\nOn 31th December he didn\u2019t send any wishes for the new year so I stopped texting first completely. Sending memes on Instagram (he would do that) isn\u2019t enough. The fact that I\u2019m the one that\u2019s mostly creating the relationship doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want anything back. What I want back? Decisions made together. \n\nFucking hell, when I asked \u201cwhat restaurant do you want to go to?\u201d he said \u201cany, you choose\u201d. This may be seen as a compliment to taste by some, just like saying \u201cyou\u2019re the expert here\u201d but I see this as a minimal effort response \u201cyou choose, I\u2019m too busy/tired\u201d. Relationships are about feedbacks, how do I know that I\u2019m doing something wrong if you don\u2019t tell me? Relationships are also about knowing another person\u2019s likes and dislikes, there is no way you like all food equally and hanging out in all kinda places. \u201cWhat hairstyle should I wear today?\u201d \u201cYou decide\u201d \u201cWhy do u think I asked you? Because I can\u2019t fucking decide\u201d. \n\nAbout not having met up in 7 months, each time I arrived in his city, the first thing I would do was informing him on it and asking for a meet up. Unfortunately, he would always make up an excuse: \u201cI can\u2019t, I have basketball practice\u201d \u201cI can sit on the bleachers tho\u201d \u201cthird persons can\u2019t enter the hall because of covid\u201d. The conversation happened one month ago, I thought the restrictions had already been cancelled. Another excuse: \u201ccan\u2019t meet up, I have my job interview\u201d \u201cbut yesterday you said you could\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were serious\u201d \u201cokay I\u2019ll wait outside the building then\u201d \u201cno\u201d \u201cwhat? The interview lasts 463 hours or am I too ugly for your boss to see us together?\u201d \u201cyou just can\u2019t\u201d.\n\nApart from indecisivenesses and excuses, what I also hate about him is the cowardice. He would never ask questions in class just like he didn\u2019t ask the captain of the team if his girlfriend couldn\u2019t sit on the bleachers until the end of the practice. \u201cThere are no exceptions of the rules\u201d he said, \u201cif the rules are written by a human, you just need to get over your pride and ask\u201d.\nEarlier during our relationship, I had to beat up his stalker. Long story short, it was a woman he knew from university. Why did I have to beat her up despite him being the one that\u2019s athletic? \u201cI don\u2019t beat up women\u201d okay, but if they make you feel unsafe, violate your privacy, cause you stress and fear then you Shouldn\u2019t. Fucking. Care. They won\u2019t stop, until you set the boundaries. He didn\u2019t care to ask if I was okay, let alone look at my damn bruises. He didn\u2019t say a simple \u2018thank you\u2019. \n\nYes, I acknowledge the fact that I could call the police on her. But he could do that as well but he didn\u2019t. \n\n\u201cYou should help each other in a relationship\u201d true, but when it comes to such fundamental things like saying no, I ain\u2019t a therapist, man, I already got a job.\n\nTo the messages in the first paragraph, I responded with a 1000 word-long message saying everything I said in the paragraphs in between and much much more. Being very rude as I was so done with all shit. It was 4am for the love of god. \n\nOn top of all of that, my mom began to bitch about me (finally) leaving him. Apparently he was her favourite boyfriend of mine (he was my first ever boyfriend by the way lmao). He was nice and polite, but aren\u2019t we all nice and polite when it comes to talking to the parents of our SO\u2019s. \n\nShe probably thinks I left a guy who treated me like I\u2019m stupid for one who will treat me like a whore. The truth is, due to ending this relationship I gained a lot of experience (haven\u2019t we all???), learnt to see those red flags and as I was unsure of myself before (cheesy warning), I learnt to love myself, I know my worth. My future bf will treat me like I should be, like a fucking queen. Just like I treated my ex with nothing given back (end).\n\nHave a nice day!"

I saw some people think it was a waste of time (looking at you grandma) & others thought she was too sexual. But both of these are kind of stupid arguments. \n\nFor the waste of time - I would say that if you don't know her songs, you'll think it's a waste of time. That's how I've felt about other halftime shows\n\nFor too sexual - she was probably the least sexual performance in years. (um, see JLo from a few years ago). All the dancers were fully clothed & the dance moves were typical. She also didn't play her most explicit songs. \n\nALSO - the fact that Rhianna performed at all was a big deal. She doesn't do music anymore, she owns a lingerie brand & a makeup brand, she has other ventures. I'm a little shocked she didn't drop an album at the end of the performance, but here goes to waiting for new music",

They said in their post about how's she was dumped with her kittens and her kittens have been rehomed, but she hasn't and that she is overlooked because she's a black cat.

I've convinced myself it's just because I got on really well with my lecturers... Even though there was external examiners marking my projects. I got membership into a design society that's impossible to get into... Nope, must have been a mistake, it must have been my research folder not my design skills that got me there. I won \"Most Creative student 2022\" and I feel like I somehow tricked everyone into thinking I'm this creative genius when I don't feel that creative. My lecturers want me to publish a book I finished in June and my RSD has made me avoid it completely.

I'll share a video of what I did too. This is not an advertisement of any sort, I'm just expressing how proud I am of myself because I never thought I'd ever be able to do anything like this ever. \n\nSo last year in my final year of college we got a brief to enter the ISTD, which stands for international society of typographical designers. It's soooo hard to get a pass. Like I wasn't even going to enter because rejection sensitivity. The brief was about 100 books that shaped the world. I love books, even though I'm a slow reader, so I got stuck in looking at all the different books. Frankenstein was one of those, I discovered Mary Shelley and instantly became obsessed with her life and the book. I hadn't realized it was written by a woman and all the different themes, plus her mum was Mary Wollstonecraft!!! So yeah I hyperfocused the feck out of it. I did have a lot of times where my brain was like \"bored now\", but then I'd find another piece of information and become obsessed all over. Organizing all of my research was painful, like I nearly gave up but somehow last minute finished it. Then the designing and imposter syndrome fun, so much pain because I didn't feel confident in typography at all, but I managed to finish it. Then had to cope with the whole printing and binding, and of course I had to be extra and stitch it together to go with the theme. I became obsessed with book binding tutorials and figured it could be a new hobby and bought book binding kits (which I haven't used since). Bound the book, then had to organize all my sketchbook research, which I left to the very last minute and submitted it. My lecturers had to convince me to submit it because I thought it was terrible. \n\nFor months waiting for the results I didn't think I'd get it, and actually cried when I got a pass. Any the whole reason I'm posting here is that my hyperfocus actually focused on something that was useful. I was already interested in horror, gothic themes, feminism, literature and history anyway so it worked out. Plus I don't think I would have had the chance to hyperfocus on Mary Shelley any other time in my life.\n\nHeres the video of how the book looked in the end https://youtu.be/1eaS27ZlgEM"

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/wz5hg7/caffeine_and_adhd/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) is the original post. Originally I said I was extremely sensitive to caffeine. \n\nSo I'm currently on my ADHD diagnosis journey and have had to argue my case with a few doctors. One of the psychiatrists I spoke to aknowleged that I might have ADHD and anxiety. I already knew about the anxiety, was on 5 mg Lexapro because my gp was afraid of putting me on anything higher because he was worried about \"dampening\" my creativity. Anyway the psychiatrist decided while I'm waiting for my diagnosis I should go on 10 mg. My anxiety problems are gone, my Ibs has completely vanished and my ADHD symptoms have become worse. So my guess is my anxiety hid a lot of my ADHD. I'll not get into that...\n\nOne thing that I've noticed now is that with my anxiety levels reduced, coffee has like no effect on me anymore. Like I think when I drink it the routine of doing so and my addiction to it makes it easier to focus. But I still feel tired as heck. Makes me wonder if my caffeine sensitivity was anxiety related? Anyone else have a similar experience?"

One had never been before and freaked out and couldn\u2019t do any rides but a couple while me and my other friend both love role coasters and rides so the one friend felt really bad because she felt like she was holding us back from having fun. Me and the other friend really didn\u2019t care we all just wanted to have fun together. Later that night after I had dropped my friend off at home she sent a really long message talking about how she was so sorry for how she was so scared all day and she felt like we wojld just be better off as a friendship duo than trio because all she did was hold  us back. Me and my other friend reassured her and we all had a really meaningful conversation about our friendship and how much we all meant to each other. That kind of thing was just really refreshing to me because I\u2019ve never had a friend that could so openly communicate their feelings , their insecurities and things like that. After being friends with her I feel like I\u2019ve had an easier time talking about my own feelings with her as well. So grateful for my two friends",

She doesn\u2019t have a license or car and her family is very poor. It is about a 20 minute walk from her house to her work but at night it is very dangerous to walk home for her and it\u2019s been pretty cold here. She didn\u2019t expect me to drive her to and from when she got the job back in August but when I saw she was having a hard time I offered to help and it\u2019s become a regular thing. Anyway I don\u2019t have any real excuse for why I want to help out less other than it\u2019s taking a lot of time away from me that I\u2019d rather spend doing other things. I always lose sleep on the nights I have to take her home because I have to stay up late to go get her. She also doesn\u2019t get out at a set time so I\u2019ve spent over an hour waiting for her to get out when she estimated the time wrong. I\u2019m sick of waiting in my car so much for her. I\u2019m also starting to develop a bit of resentment towards her recently because of this. I would still be okay with taking her home because like I said it\u2019s dangerous for her to walk home at night but I want to stop taking her to work so much. So WIBTAH if I stopped taking to work so much when it means that she would have to take the bus home after school and then immediately begin walking to work to get there in time and I have the means to take her there more easily?"

                "body": "Hi - \n\nI\u2019m NT, am starting to realize the man I was dating a year ago may be ND. He displays a lot of behaviors more typical to someone who is ND, and suddenly so many things make sense. When we met he was also severely traumatized by a pretty abusive relationship where he was made to feel very bad about his ND behaviors (not knowing when to help, how to initiate sex or make someone have a pleasurable experience etc.) He seemed to mask a lot when we met because of those traumatic experiences but when things got overwhelming during our relationship, that mask quickly dropped. The inconsistency made me feel confused and I started creating stories in my head that he didn\u2019t like me anymore. I would not have felt that way if he presented more like his usual self when we first met because I believe my mom is ND and I was raised to feel that ND behavior is more \u201cright\u201d than NT behavior. However, the change in behavior made my NT brain look for reasons that may not have been there. I told him these things in a matter of fact way - never tried to shame him, but it would be understandable if he felt shame about yet another partner misunderstanding him. He later told me that he felt I needed more emotional connection than he could give and that he was only good in the beginning because he was so sad about his last relationship that he poured a lot of energy into this one. I had no idea at the time that he was talking about masking, but I felt confused because I had never asked him to do the things he had done. It almost felt like he was following a formula and thought that formula would make me happy.\n\nI feel that we really cared about each other and I still love him very much - even more so now that I have a possible explanation for his behavior and I don\u2019t interpret them as a rejection of me. I would like to reach out to him and talk about it if he\u2019s willing. Would you suggest I float the idea of Asperger\u2019s to him directly or would that be offensive? Should I try to clarify any of the miscommunications issues we had in this email or leave that for our convo if he wants to talk? Do you have suggestions for improvements to the following text? Is it clear and is there anything in it that could hurt his feelings? \n\n++++\n\nDear xxx,\nI\u2019m sorry to be bothering you so late after our last conversation. I\u2019ve found it really hard to get over you and needed to send you this email in order to feel some sense of closure. \n\nFirstly, I want to apologize for any stress and hurt I caused through miscommunication. I truly didn\u2019t mean to hurt your feelings and I think I was a bit confusing in the way I expressed things. I see how hard you tried to make me happy and how much you cared about me. \n\nRecently I came across some important information that helped me understand why we had such trouble understanding each other. I think that information could really make things easier for us, so if you ever wanted to talk about it and talk about the possibility of dating again, please reach out to me (email is best). I promise the conversation would be kind and understanding. I wont be angry if you dont reach out to me, but I wanted you to know that I would like to talk if you want to. \n\nThanks for reading. \n\nAll the best,"

I've tried methods that are usually regarded as helpful (sitting with my thoughts, not forcing them out, reminding myself that it was a long time ago, that nobody thinks worse of me for those moments, etc...) and less helpful methods (SH, shouting at myself, forcing the thoughts out, trying to convince myself that it never happened or that nobody could remember it) but regardless of the method, it never worked for longer than a couple days. It's been so long, I just can't deal with them anymore but I'm at a loss for what to do. Looking up tips on how to get rid of them, most results are regarding thoughts about morally wrong things they could do, but since my thoughts are quite different than that those tips aren't really helping me. I live in Ireland and our mental health system is really awful, at the very best they would tell me I'm bipolar or something and say there's nothing to be done, so going to a professional isn't really an option.

And changes the subject to something to do with her that we were talking about earlier. I get that she might not be interested but she could at least try, right? I'm also very aware that she thinks she's a little autistic and I've noticed doesn't seem to easily be able to display empathy. I'm okay with that and understand that, but if that seems like the cause for this to anybody else, I'd really appreciate some help with that, maybe just different perspectives or smth :) This whole thing stings a little more that it usually would because just a few months ago I got out of a really toxic and manipulative friendship which I'm still suffering the effects from. Part of why this was toxic was because she really didn't care at all about my life and would do the exact same thing this friend is doing. I never want to compare the two, but I really don't want a repeat of that friendship because I'm still trying to overcome all the trauma I faced.   \nIt's also worth mentioning that I live in a very small town and all our friends our mutual friends so \"just drop her\" really isn't an option here.

I've spent my whole life drawing and I've been told I'm pretty good at it :) I've always dreamed of going to art school (which is a whole 'nother can of worms) and getting a job in drawing. Recently I've been debating whether or not I should still do that. I'm a straight A student and could probably go into something more respected, while also being something I enjoy, like physics or psychology. Art is frustrating and finicky and doesn't pay well. I feel like I'm wasting my potential by going into art, even though I really love it :| any advice at all is appreciated lol"

                "body": "So, I am aroace. Before I get into the aro stuff, I want to talk about being ace for a minute (you can skip this part if it's too long for you lol)   \nI've known I was ace for a little while now, but I just recently became very, very sure of it. I had the suspicion that I was ace before I had even come across the label- it was around when I was 13. I just remember watching the big bang theory and thinking about how strange and wrong it felt that they all kind of pressured sheldon to be more \"intimate\". It's what got me wondering, I knew there was a lot of different lgbtq labels, I wonder if there's one for not wanting sex? So I went through a list of different sexualities- and I found the ace label. I was honestly really happy to see that it was acutally a thing that existed, not just something I was making up in my head. However, the first few years I kept assuming I might be too young to know, so I wasn't sure about using the label. I'm still only 16 now but, I've become very confident that at the very least, I will always be *somewhere* on the acespec lol (though right now I am very much a sex-repulsed ace). I live with a homophobic parent though, so I do still sometimes doubt myself and wonder if I'm just making it up- but I've realize that's just anxiety trying to get to me, so aside from that, I am very comfortable with my asexuality now :)  \n\n\nHowever, romantic attraction has been something that's much, much harder for me to figure out... I always just assumed that I would want a romantic relationship someday when I'm older- but now I'm starting to realize that I don't... really feel the same way as other people?? and I don't think I'd ever want to kiss anyone like, on the lips or anything, idk it just seems weird and a little gross to me lol, but it's hard for me to say for sure that I don't feel any sort of romantic feelings... the line between wanting to be really close best friends with somebody or be with them romantically is pretty blurry to me, especially when the whole \"intimate\" part is removed. I still want to have a very close emotional connection with someone, I just don't really think that it necessarily is a romantic one... Like, why can't you just have that with friends??? Why can't you have that just going out with friends and hiking and going on adventures and just having fun???  \n\n\nI've only realized that I am probably aromantic very recently, and I'm still trying to come to terms with it... it can be really hard to do when most people tend to consider romantic love a basic emotion \ud83d\ude44, or that being aromantic means I can't feel LOVE, like- that's just stupid. Of course I still feel love, I love my friends, why does that have to be ROMANTIC???!! dxfcfvdxdcfvg  \n\n\nAnyways, atm I'm just going with the greyaro label, but I'll probably end up using just aromantic once I've come more to terms with it... I'd like to hear what some of you guys think about it. Is there any label that could fit better?"

                "body": "Okay so... for a while I've just assumed I was cis-female, however, this was before I knew agender was actually a thing. When I heard about people being able to \"feel\" like their gender, I was... very confused haha. I don't think I'd feel any different no matter what body I was in... I just feel like myself. However, before I knew about the agender label, I just thought, if I *have* to have a gender... I guess female fits the best. But like... I don't *feel* it. But the weird thing is, I do feel an attachment to the *experience* of being female, just not really the *gender*,.... If that makes any sense haha. And... I feel like I still want to be seen as female at times, be included in female groups and things like that. Yet, I don't really feel like it's a part of me... just kind of like as a social status or something?? I also feel perfectly fine with both She/her and They/them pronouns. I'm just like, \"use whichever you want to\" lol. Although, I do think the amount I want to be seen as female slightly fluctuates at times as well, but often I just don't really care enough about gender to really think much about it. Like some days I kind of want to use agender more than female, but I get nervous about people judging me and then just kind of shrug the idea off.\n\nRecently I discovered the term \"librafeminine\", and I feel like that REALLY fits what I've been feeling extremely well. (maybe more specifically, librawoman)\n\nBut the thing that keeps stopping me from using both the agender and female labels (or just librafeminine) is that *if* I was around someone that happened to be queerphobic or whatever, I'd be perfectly okay with being *seen* as just female (even if it isn't completely my true identity), and I just... feel like that invalidates my experience or smth lol, I don't know... I can imagine a lot of people might be upset at being treated or referred to as having a gender, and because I don't *really* feel that, I make myself think I'm not \"allowed\" to use the term. Idk, ik that's a pretty stupid way to think but.. I'm blaming my anxiety for this lol.  \n\n\nEdit: Thank you guys for being so supportive of this haha! I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who feels this way :)"

They were offering some kind of sign-up bonus because they REALLY wanted people in my area. Sign-up was easy, but took 2 weeks of driving before they'd officially guarantee my rate.  That's okay because I wasn't crunched on time, but they want you to pay them upfront. The amount you pay is based on safe driving. If you don't fall into their definition of safe driving, they drop you at the end of the 2 week drive. I've read some people have had accidents during this time and got royally screwed. I held my old insurance and ROOT during this time to be safe. The rate was about 1/3 lower than the lowest rate I was quoted by any other company.\n\nThat's not why ROOT sucks. ROOT sucks because after having them 6 months and it came time to renew, my rate nearly tripled because they now said the area I lived in was high risk. No other car insurance company has ever said this and I have a completely clean driving record. The worst part of it all was I received notice of the rate change 2 days before they were supposed to charge my account, putting me on a time crunch to go back to my old insurance (love you Geico). \n\ntldr: ROOT deserves to be shorted.

Lunch time was a nightmare with him (throwing food on the floor and at me\ud83d\ude43. Same thing happened with the previous nanny too. He's obviously bored with having the same food all the time), but at least he was actually eating food. Then before his nap he would have a bottle when he went to sleep (this was the routine until 18mo) \n\nWhen breakfast was added into the mix, it was hard at first, but now he's actually \"eating\"...and what I mean by that is: he eats a little bit, but them starts chewing up the food and keeping it in his mouth and then when he's over it then he spits it out on the floor (he used to get your hand so that he can spit into it. Is it gross? Yes, but it was an improvement. Unfortunately he's started to regress back into old habits: spitting, hitting, biting. I'm 80% sure that it has to do with the baby and him not knowing how to deal with his parents divided attention...). This happens with everything that he eats, even when he actually starts eating it. \n\nHe also has this thing where he doesn't understand that when he wants something else he can just swallow what he already has in his mouth instead of spitting it out. The only thing that he'll finish is Nutribon (It's Gerber oatmeal mixed with his formula and it has the consistency of rice porridge) or his bottle. I'm not bagging on BM in anyway shape or form. She really tried to get him on solid food, but it's tiring and frustrating for her. And atp I'm not even gonna touch on BD,  that's a whole other reddit post,  but to make a long story short- he is no help... \n\nI've been having trouble eating, but recently I've been bringing food to work with me and eating it with him so that he can have new things and thankfully he'll kinda eat it. Should I just keep doing what I've been doing and trying to get him to eat a little bit more over time so that he gets satisfied/full without me having to make him a bottle? \n\nTL; DR: NK is still on the bottle, he's two, when given solid food he only eats a little bit and spits it out. Do I just start giving some of my lunch to him and give him more & more over time until he can get full off of solid food? \n\nI hope that what I'm trying to say makes sense"

NK is smart enough to pull it open when it's unlocked). I kept saying \"(NK name), wait a second, bubs)\" and \"Hold on buddy, just wait for me and then we can go.\" He hesitated(???) and just kept going.

While you can certainly deviate from that if you\u2019d like, please make sure to mention you\u2019re deviating from the system. \n\nThere\u2019s starting to be a lot of confusion for people, especially new people on what the system actually is, thus making it a lot more complicated than it should be. \n\nRita\u2019s system requires you to know your style logic before you can move on to archetypes, quadrants, shadow types, aesthetics. It\u2019s meant to challenge you to think about who you really are and what you really want. And so it\u2019s probably not going to be something you\u2019re going to figure out in a day or two. Skipping the steps is often why people struggle to know where they are. \n\nThe style logic eliminates choices to make it easy to know your exact quadrant. Really knowing your style logic will tell you if your LD, RU, LU or RD. It takes care of the vertical ANd the horizontal in one go.\n\nIt\u2019s not something that restricts you, but frees you from the constant indecision, the searching, the confusion and the self doubt.\n\nThen the rest falls into place very quickly and you end up with something authentically you, which what we all really want. \n\nUse style logic to have your clothes serve you!"

I can't stop caring about her, feeling sorry for her, not wanting to hurt her - I hate the thought of her crying, feeling alone, etc.  However, every time I've allowed myself to trust her, she has said and done catty, petty and hurtful things deliberately, and then denied it.\n\nLately, she's been getting increasingly desperate because she can tell that I'm trying to get away (and, frankly, I'm the only \"friend\" she has left).  She's starting to get really intense, extra inappropriate and weird.  I haven't answered her calls or messages for a while, and she's starting to freak out. I don't know what to do, what to say, or how to de-escalate this, because I'm too close to her/it.  On the one hand, I feel awful *not* explaining why I don't want to be around her, but it feels like every time I've *tried* to explain how I felt, she has proved to be incapable of understanding or empathizing with me.  She just projects, gets defensive and plays the victim.  She completely ignores any points I bring up, or tries to convince me that it happened differently, etc.  It's like pulling teeth to have a *real* conversation with her.\n\nI just want advice about how not to feel *so* sad and guilty about this whole thing.

The narcs would behave intrusively (trying to invite themselves over, calling at 5 AM, sending REALLY long emails), when I was trying to focus on other things, such as work, projects, etc, and had been clear from the start about my time being limited.  It has turned into threats of suicide, or them trying to make me responsible for how lonely they are, and bemoaning their perceived lack of importance in my life.  There's one person in particular who tries to probe me, regularly attempting to get more involved in my affairs, and painting herself to be the \"discarded\" friend... but ONLY when she thinks I'm spending too much time with *other* people.  She checks my social media, keeping track of interactions I have with other people, and contrasting that with the amount of attention I give her.  Another person also berated me about not having enough time for him.  This would be sandwiched between paragraphs and paragraphs of heartbreaking stories, about how everyone always abandons him, everyone is shallow and cruel, how much he does for them, and how no one understands him.  Once again, this person would guilt trip me for having other friends who I was closer to.  The narc ex, similarly, HATED my friends, trying to convince me that they were all sly, manipulative, abusive, etc, and how they didn't understand me like he did.  The experience has been one of very needy people going out of their way to guilt trip me and punish me for exercising boundaries, or not having enough time for them, even though they *know* that I work, and have a busy life.\n\nDoes this stuff sound familiar?  :("

I filled two standard 16 oz mason jars to about 80% with finely chopped knotweed roots.  I then filled the jars with 100 proof 50% vodka (I did not mix it with water).  I put plastic over the jars, sealed them in a dark cupboard and shook them daily for about eight weeks (probably too long?).  Yesterday, I strained the mixture and funnelled it into some 15 ml amber tincture bottles.  Honestly, I have no idea what the dosage would be, per drop, let's say."

Some important background info is that she and I were/are both having a hard time at the moment. Friendo works a very stressful job, has 2 kids + an Ex who owes her child support and is a general ass. For my part, my dad just died 2 weeks ago and I'm devastated + I've been unwell/just very tired as a result. This was the conversation (exact wording and punctuation, all over text) which took place:\n\nFriend (8 PM): \"I got in touch with ex and I feel like I need to talk.\"\n\n(12 AM): \"I talked to ex and I needed to talk.\"\n\n(12 AM): \"Guess you are too busy\"\n\n(2 AM): \"Uh. I messaged.

Especially at a time in my life like this.\"\n\nFriend (10 AM): \"Me saying you are too busy for me is not a guilt trip it's more of an observation I'm not trying to guilt trip you so please don't put words in my mouth\"\n\n\"People get busy in their lives I'm not blaming you for that\"\n\n\"I don't have negative feelings it was more thought processes of mine\"\n\n\"So please don't act like you know everything about what I was saying without ACTUALLY talking to me. I think you should know me better than that\"\n\nMe: \"This is what I interpreted as a guilt trip \"Uh. I messaged. And I needed you.\"\"\n\n\"Definitely felt like a guilt trip even if you didn't see it that way\"\n\nFriend: \"Can you at least try to see something else besides your own perspective\"\n\n\"I don't ask for much I'm not a huge drain on your life or friendship I think that maybe once in a while I could use some support\"\n\n\"If that's too much for you that's fine\"\n\n\"I've tried to be there for you\"\n\n\"And I literally said if there's anything that you need please call me and you never did\"\n\nMe: \"Now you're putting words in my mouth\"\n\nFriend: \"There are no words im putting in your mouth here. Its my words and perspective\"\n\n\"What did I say that can be construed as words im putting in your mouth? Everything I said was my perspective. If you want to fight I don't want to be part of it\"\n\nMe: \"I don't want to fight either\"\n\nFriend: \"I feel like we both have high emotions right now and we could benefit from some time\"\n\nMe: \"Indeed\"\n\nFriend: \"I'm not meaning to hurt you. if you think that it's not true\"\n\nThat was the end of the conversation. We've had conflicts in the past, and (from my perspective, anyway) she's had a history of guilt tripping me (usually for not answering the phone/being busy). Lately, however, we've messaged one another almost daily via Hangouts (which I'm pretty sure she knows is the best way to reach me). Also, I'd answered the phone when she needed to talk only a few days prior. I feel really hurt, and I feel like I need some outside perspective."

I guess I just want to feel less alone and have some others comprehend the intensity of my experience.  It doesn't even feel real.\n\nIt's been a couple years now, since I started living better, having more money, etc, but I can't get over this feeling, somehow.  I used to get the absolute cheapest versions of everything... or I just plain went without.  For me, it's such a massive luxury that I can regularly afford out of season produce, fruit juice, nuts, dessert, cheese, wine, nicer tea (as opposed to the cheapest possible store brands).  I can have clothes that won't fall apart within 1-2 years.  I can even occasionally buy some of the softwares that I want/need.  I can get video games without waiting years for their prices to drop, and I can have fast internet.  I can put a little money aside in a savings account if I want to.  My house is clean and it's always warm.  I can by plants to put in the garden.  Hell, I've even travelled a few times!  I never did that even *once* as a kid - never even imaged that it could be a possibility.  I can spend money on frivolous things, like beauty products, bath milk and makeup if I want to.\n\nIn childhood, I used to go to other people's houses, and I'd sometimes see pantries brimming with food, and I would be confused.  I wouldn't understand how their families could afford even a fraction of the items I saw.  Heck, I usually didn't even *recognize* most of the items/brands I saw.  We would get a box of (the cheapest) cookies once a month, and this was a major treat.  We weren't allowed to eat anything without asking, and we'd usually be yelled at if the granted amount was exceeded, even if we were still hungry.  It seemed like many of my friends, on the other hand, were allowed to just eat whatever they felt like without any real consequence.\n\nI'm still not over it, and I'm still getting used to this experience.  I literally feel like a queen every single day, and I'm very slowly shedding my prior self image of being downtrodden and impoverished like I used to be."

Ive been porn/masturbation free for almost 2 years, but i still sometimes struggle with it.\n\nLearn more about it, and first of all quit porn. It is literally evil because it warps your brain to think sexually, get higher standards and become irrational. Masturbation is also not healthy in my eyes because it gives you huge stimulation for no effort. Also its emotional and impulsive. But first focus on quitting porn since its the worst of it. If u masturbate now and then thats not really a problem, but it depends on how you want to live. I quit it all since i dont want to do anything im not proud of. Good luck!",

You\u2019d match and start chatting\u2026. And he\u2019d be incapable of holding a coherent conversation. It would be all these bizarre jokes and weird, random stories you suspect are lies. \n\nThinking about the other cast members, I can see how each of these would fail on dating apps\u2026\n\nShaq - texts soliloquies that feel rehearsed and self-absorbed. Works in little negs masked as \u201cjokes\u201d. Only messages women much better looking than himself. Projects an entire personality onto that you don\u2019t have. Has been having a whole relationship with you in his head. \n\nAirris - low effort \u201chey\u201d intro followed by testing using inappropriate sexual comments to see if you have weak boundaries and you\u2019ll tolerate him being an f-boy. Won\u2019t openly say he\u2019s just seeking casual sex, instead says vague things like \u201cI\u2019m open to what happens\u201d. \n\nChris - seems nice but shows zero personality. Only interests are TV and dogs. Seems whiny and profile says something like \u201care there any loyal women out there anymore?\u201d  Messages are polite and generic and go nowhere. You try to plan a date but he\u2019s so wishy-washy you can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s passive or disinterested. \n\nClint - entire personality is sailing and being \u201cadventurous\u201d.  Hypes up his life to sound exciting but it sounds exhausting. \u201cPositive vibes only\u201d. Thinks he\u2019s a hot playboy but comes across like a peter pan. Thinks he\u2019s in better shape than he actually is and wants someone younger so they can \u201ckeep up with him\u201d. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t know what women are like to date, but this is what I imagine\u2026\n\nKirsten - doesn\u2019t understand why she doesn\u2019t get quality men swiping because she\u2019s so pretty.  Has \u201csize\u201d requirements in her profile which otherwise mainly consists of \u201cdon\u2019t message me unless\u2026\u201d\n\nNicole - love bombs people and sends 5 messages in a row before one can be answered. Gets angry if you don\u2019t respond within a few hours (because you have a job) and sends a final bitter message saying \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just unmatch me if you\u2019re not going to reply?\u201d  Then unmatches with you. \n\nGina - entire personality is boss babe salon owner. Doesn\u2019t really have time to date and makes a big deal about squeezing you in for drinks between haircuts. Thinks she\u2019s hotter and thinner than she is and uses filtered photos from 5 years ago. \n\nJasmine - never single long because she\u2019s pleasant and attractive and sells herself well. You match with her only to find her profile deleted the next day. 6 months later, her profile is back, immediately after ending it with her ex that she did not vet very well.\n\nDom - profile says \u201cmy mom is my best friend\u201d. Says she\u2019s an old soul but all of her pictures are of her partying and drinking. When you message her, you notice her messages have much worse grammar and a totally different tone than her profile (because mom wrote it). She says she\u2019s looking for a nice guy for a serious relationship, but quickly grows bored of you and ghosts."

It\u2019s different from a complaint about a specific situation. Gil didn\u2019t make complaints so much as criticize Myrla\u2019s personality, tastes, interests and lifestyle choices. \n\n- Contempt: Gil displayed contempt for Myrla and her preferences.\n\n- Defensiveness: Myrla was defensive of herself. She\u2019d push back by disagreeing with Gil\u2019s name calling. This was more subtle, but it was present. A healthier style would be to express how it made her feel.\n\n- Stonewalling: Myrla didn\u2019t seem to bother to communicate how stuff made her feel. She just closed up, in response to the contemptuous attitude from Gil. This happens most right before the \u201cend\u201d. \n\nBoth Gil and Myrla are attractive people with a lot going for them, but they had poor communication. Contempt is one of the strongest predictors of divorce, and Gil displayed a lot of it for Myrla."

                "body": "For anyone else who enjoys personality typology\u2026\n\nThis is what I think the cast\u2019s types are (from this season). I wrote quick explanations. Feel free to discuss your take. \n\n(FYI - Myers Briggs types are based on Jungian psychological types and represent preferred thinking styles. Enneagram is the ego fixation.) \n\n\nMyrla - ISTJ 3w4\n\nSelf-described introvert. Introverted sensing makes her particular about her experiences. Extroverted judging as an auxiliary preference makes her goal oriented, organized and valuing of things like knowledge (ie education). Lower feeling development may make her seem cold and rude. Enneagram 3 is an image oriented type who works hard because they define their worth by their external achievements. Can be superficial and ambitious. The 4 wing brings in an aloofness and need for things to be special to make up for an inner sense of defectiveness. \n\nGil - ESFJ 2w3\n\nGil shows he is an extroverted feeling type because he is outgoing, warm and value driven, but can also be emotionally manipulative, knowing how to make a dig with a smile on his face. With less developed thinking, he struggles with a logical strategy in life (ie wants 8 kids). He is a fairly earthy person yet simultaneously aware of status - a common trait in ESFJs. He shows enneagram 2 trait of defining himself by how likable and helpful he is to others. He needs to be the center of attention and his ego is bruised when he\u2019s not quickly adored. \n\nJose - ESTJ 3w2\n\nJose is outgoing but emotionally clueless. He shows dominant extroverted thinking as he is highly driven to achieve measurable things - ie a good credit score. He values stability and tradition, suggesting introverted sensing. He shows low intuition in being closed to new things like travel. As already noted about enneagram 3, he is also achievement focused to the detriment of introspection. \n\nRachel - ESFP 9w1\n\nRachel enjoys novelty and experiencing new things, showing her preference for extroverted sensing. She\u2019s spontaneous and warm, typical of ESFPs. With lower thinking preference, she can lack organization. Lower intuition shows a lack of long-term vision (charge it now, worry about money later). As a 9, she can struggle with asserting herself and easily gets wrapped up in someone else\u2019s agenda. Nonetheless she also has a stubborn streak. Appearing a fairly healthy 9, she has developed good diplomatic skills and is comfortable being independent. \n\nBrett - ESFJ 6w7 (maybe ISFJ)\n\nBrett shows extroverted feeling with her warm demeanor and anxiousness to please. Building rapport with others is important to her. She dislikes new experiences and falls easily into a comfort zone - very introverted sensing, her auxiliary preference. As an enneagram 6, she\u2019s anxious and seeks stability. Part of pleasing others and avoiding unfamiliar situations is due to her 6 fear fixation. \n\nRyan - ISTP 9w8\n\nRyan is a doer not a talker. ISTPs like to express through spontaneous action, due to secondary extroverted sensing. With low feeling, they can struggle to express feelings and may find it hard to connect with others. Although dominant in introverted thinking, an ISTP may not appear as a classically logically type, instead honing mental systems in real time through their exploration, as we see Ryan makes sense of the world through hands on experience. As a 9, Ryan is passive, struggles to assert his preferences out of extreme fear of conflict, and may narcotize himself mentally by being physically on the go all the time. \n\nBao - INTJ 1w9\n\nBao is an introverted intuitive in that she is surprisingly open to novelty despite also being very focused and strategic. She can appear cerebral, cool and mildly eccentric. She can get out of touch with the sensory world, ie not showering and struggling to connect with her environment. Bao shows secondary extroverted thinking with her enjoyment of mentally organizing (ie spread sheets). As an enneagram 1, she has high standards and ideals, such as wanting a \u201cbrilliant mind\u201d in a partner. She can be self righteous at times but also beats herself up for falling short of ideals. The 9 wing makes Bao fear conflict and become a people pleaser to try and merge with others. \n\nJohnny - ESTJ 1w2\n\nJohnny is very externally focused on things meeting his ideals. He is exacting and critical. This points to both his preference for extroverted thinking and his very strong ego fixation at 1. Curiously he\u2019s the same enneatype as Bao, making her a prime candidate for his projections and self righteous anger. 1s are angry at anything and anyone imperfect and Johnny is very, very angry. As a sensing type, Johnny has trouble seeing beyond what is. He gets stuck on details and his extrapolations are childlike (undeveloped intuition). With a 2 wing, he cannot tolerate being disliked, and he is prideful, feeling he does more for others than they for him. \n\nZack - ENFJ 3w2\n\nAs an extroverted feeling type and a 3, Zack is charismatic and strives to embody cultural ideals. He can also be phony and is out of touch with his own feelings, taking on the feelings of others too readily. As an intuitive type, he thinks metaphorically and can be offbeat and creative. Being a 3, he doesn\u2019t accept failure. His self worth is measured by how successful he is. He is image conscious and can be fake at time because of it. \n\nMichaela -  ESFJ 2w3 \n\nI had the hardest time typing her because she\u2019s clearly unstable, so this is an \u201cunhealthy\u201d type description\u2026 She is volatile, like an enneagram 2 disintegrating at point 8 (sadistic - punishes from sense of being slighted). An unhealthy 2 is histrionic, causing drama shamelessly. They\u2019re also seductive initially but then demand to be the center of everything or they may punish people. Like Zack, Michaela is an extroverted feeling type and knows how to charm at times, to build quick rapport and express what\u2019s appropriate. But being a sensing type, abstract communication and metaphor is lost on her, sounding like pretentious nonsense."

                "body": "Such an insightful post! (Any time I say modeling I\u2019m meaning runway modeling, not magazine/social media/photos) I have been thinking about this a ton lately. As an SN or R (probably, still on the journey haha) and as someone who went to school for fashion, this has always been something that I was really aware of. I love very feminine, soft, and round designs, it is just how I have always designed, but everything I ever created for school always ended up having at least yang undercurrents (if not complete influence) cause of the nature of the figure we are taught to draw on. Don't get me wrong, I love my designs and I am proud of my work, but I always walk away saying that what I draw would never look good on me. I think modeling for haute couture is different than other modeling too, if they wanna keep thin (industry standard) models for that, I think that\u2019s fine cause couture is art more than clothing anyways (doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ethical or right, just artistic choice I guess). \n\nHowever, I truly believe all other brands need to start using and designing for different shapes. One way this could change (and is changing) is by allowing different models into the industry that are different shapes and sizes. In my opinion, models are so thin because that makes them \u201changers\u201d for the clothes, that their body wouldn\u2019t take away from the design at all, but that (like in the photos you shared) is not always true! Definitely gonna think on this more, it is such a complex topic!",

Then last summer I got diagnoses with polycyclic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and a side effect of that is weight gain and struggling to lose weight. I am actively trying to lose weight because of the impact it has had on my health, but until then I am tired of feeling bad and ashamed about my body because my old clothes don\u2019t fit, so I need to get new clothes and honor my body where it is!! I have always been pretty traditionally \u201ccurvy\u201d (I know that doesn\u2019t mean I have kibbe curve), finding pants that fit and looked good has always been a struggle and I usually prefer myself in dresses, but I just feel really uncomfortable with everything I try on now. I am hoping that learning my type and what lines I should wear to help me feel more confident going to stores and trying things on (rather than just feeling uncomfortable and overwhelmed). I usually gain weight in my lower body first (butt,thighs,hips), then my arms and face, then my chest and stomach. I also had a breast reduction two and a half years ago, I used to have a much bigger chest, don\u2019t know if that would change anything haha!! Open to any other questions too!! \ud83d\ude0a",

Nobody ever picks up on my dry humour. Nobody ever understands the pop-cultural references I make. Nobody understands my sarcasm and I come off as pretentious and unrelatable. As a result of all this, I fail to provide a safe space for the people I am speaking and allow them to be responsive.\n\nPeople don't talk here much. Even if they do, they don't talk with me. I've only spent 2 months under these circumstances and I feel very vulnerable. I am a little reluctant to speak with international kids who perhaps have similar experiences to mine, because there is NONE in my major and it's hard to start a conversation with someone you don't know anything about.\n\nThanks for reading it all. What do I do?"

Literally same thing happened to me. \n\nI met this guy who was on a work trip and we hit it off instantly we just had that chemistry, we could just talk about anything and the way he looked at me, treated me and how thoughtful, respectful and considerate he was i fell for him. 1st date we went to the movies then 2nd and 3rd date, i spent the night at his place in his arms. I saw him off and got something like a farewell msg. \n\nI didn't wanna end it on that so i made some effort and initiated being the 1st one to text and soon we were talking daily after work for like a month. Then the conversation had to be done and he said that he has reservations around any kind of ldr because it pains him that he cant hold me. \n\nIt hurts me too but i was willing to put the effort to make it work like save up so i could go see him on holidays and stuff but he didn't give me a chance to say that. He made a decision for me that i would get less hurt if we stop now. It was not for him to decide but i just couldn't pursue it further. I cant make him stay if he doesn't want to.\n\nAt first he was swaying me to move to his city but i just wasnt assured by him so i told him i wont move for him because he will feel obliged to be with me and i dont want him to be with be because he needs to but be with me because he wants to.\n\nThis was just so heartbreaking because this was my 1st time feeling like this with a guy, the chemistry the admiration we had for each other it was just so hard to let go. Everyday after work the only thing i looked forward to was talking to him it just replenished me and made my day. It felt like he opened my heart filled it and took it all away. \n\nAnd it hurts more because it felt like he genuinely wanted to try it with me too. Its been like 1 month now that we have stopped talking and it still hurts and i still miss him. I don't think I'll go away but you just learn to live with it and life goes on. If you ever wanna rant about it dm me i can hear you out because i feel like i understand what youre going through.",

When i was a child probably like 8yr old when the one from Australia used to visit, this happened like 3-4 times. As i child i didn't know this stuff. So i used to go play with his ipad, and he used to touch me. I didn't pay mind to it and just kept playing with the ipad and he used to keep me on his lap and rub my parts. It felt weird so i stopped going in after a few times and he left after like 2 months and probably didn't visit for years. \n\nIt was only later when i reached at an understandable age, i realized what had happened. I pretended like i don't remember or i don't know anything till now and im 20 rn. But recently Australia was pretty lenient with visas and my aunt (his wife) had been pressuring me to come study there and it was an opportunity definitely so my parents were also encouraging me. He had also been acting like he didn't remember anything during calls all those years so i thought it was a thing of the past. So i left my studies here and left for Australia. But within two days of my stay here he has been talking about my weight a lot and in that talk he freaking grabbed me from behind and tried to carry me! I was freaked out. \n\nAfter that i have been keeping my distance and told my mom about this incident and that i feel very uncomfortable around him. She laughed it out saying \"oh! he might still think you're a child. He might break his back.\" But she does not know about the childhood incident. Actually no one does. The second time we talked about this i contemplated telling her but i froze. I was afraid that either they wouldn't believe me or this would break everything because it's something pretty serious. And she would break down because I didn't tell her before coming here. And she might die worrying for those 3 years of my study. Idk what to do rn because avoiding him is impossible since we live in the same house and some things are are there that needs his help. Its been like a few days ive kept a distance but i get really scared when he even sits close to me."

The plot was an acid trip and everything was just all over the place, there were no comical or emotional moments or even any suspense, thrilling or action sequence, i usually like fantasy but this just wasn't it. There were no fun characters, there was nothing to get into didn't understand wtf was going on. Just random weird things happened in the bathhouse that were completely irrelevant to the actual plot ie. her escaping. Those events did not build up a scenario for her escape, all it took was for her to guess who her parents were. All in all i found it boring and just didn't like it. I just forced myself to complete it since it was very liked and in hopes that maybe it will get better. But no, it didn't get better and I didn't enjoy any bit of it! Just left a bad first impression of ghibli movies as a whole. I just can't seem so understand why is it so popular. The art and animation was the only good thing about this movie.\n\nEdit 1: should've titled it as i didn't like it instead of calling it awful since its about what i think. That was my bad sorry about that.\n\nEdit 2: people are pointing out that what i said about it not being emotional is wrong. Well it might be but it was me who didn't find it probably because it wasn't presented that way.\n\nEdit 3: so ive made a few thousand people hate me, now thats something!"

But i had to rewatch all spiderman movies after no way home and boy i just cant seem to suppress my hatred for Mary Jane Watson that i have to make a rant post about it. And let me clarify that im just talking about her character only and not the entire movie. After spiderman 2 i had trouble thinking about watching 3 because I didn't wanna deal with her shenanigans. \n\nShe is a toxic, manipulative gold digger who thinks and wants everyone to fall in love with her. What did Peter Parker even see in her that made him fall head over heels for her?! She was a damsel in distress all the time and just ruined some things for Peter. Firstly she is dating a Flash knowing he is a bully. Then she slowly goes on giving peter the hints. Right after graduation she dumps Flash saying \"i don't need you ANYMORE\" which kinda shows why she was dating flash in the first place. She just wanted to have the sort of rich power guy in her hands. Next she dates Harry again very rich guy and while flirting with Peter. And cheats on Harry by kissing spiderman by saying \"do i get to say thank you this time?\" I mean wtf does she go on kissing everyone that she wants to thank or what. Thanking doesn't usually involves kissing ya know. Not to mention she crushed on spiderman just because he saved her life. Then she confesses to Peter in Harry's father's funeral which is just so inappropriate. \n\nSpiderman 2, she again talks to Peter about \"them\" and then proceeds to bring up that she is seeing someone else. She is actually anticipating Peter specifically to watch her play instead of Jameson, her current boyfriend. At this point she i just playing with Peter's feelings. Again another rich guy. Outside the theatre of her play she meets with her new guy and is still waiting for Peter. She also proceeds to accept his proposal possibly just to get to Peter. She is playing both her fiance and Peter. Then she asks Jameson to put his head a way so she can kiss him like the kiss with spiderman while thinking of him. And later askes Peter to kiss her when she is engaged like wtf! Also in the part where doc oct is drowning along with the whole platform and a windowish structure almost falls on her and Peter as spiderman saves her the first thing she says is \"so you do love me!\" Bruh! Dude is using all his strength to hold the thing that would have otherwise crushed her and instead of moving away from below the structure so he can finally leave it and take a breath, she continues sitting there with her lovestruck fantasy. Istg i was so exasperated in this part i almost threw away my device. If all this wasn't enough she tops it all of by running away on her wedding day leaving jameson hanging after hugging him till the day before when she knew from the start she never loved him or ever cared about him. She just used him to get to Peter. No finally when she knew that Peter is spiderman ie. A superhero, she finally gives in to him completely ignoring apl the future odds whose result we see in S3. \n\nSpiderman 3, im so done with her at this point that i don't have much to say here but she was somehow bearable here. Just that she starts getting annoyed at peter for not being there for her when she go fired from her job. But she never told peter that she got fired. how was he supposed to know that without her telling him. So when she brought it up peter talked about his success because he thought she was successful and with that they both could relate. And lets not even get started about going back to harry again and making out with him when she only had an argument with Peter. Well peter Also did kiss gwen but then again if MJ thinks its ok to kiss spiderman as she did then she shouldn't be hurt by that anyway. (Her words not mine) and once again the damsel in distress part ugh.\n\nAll she has done through the trilogy is manipulative the guys, cheat on them switch between them time and again and just use them mostly to get someone else. She's broke their hearts played with the feelings of all the guys and doesn't stop till the end. In conclusion, she is a toxic ass bitch that in a way ravaged the whole experience for me as i was so damn annoyed to see her everytime. But honestly she was the worst in 2 and most beatable in 3 for me at least.\n\nGwen Stacy, now that is a wonderful character.\u00a0 She was her own woman, strong, smart, independent and a really nice ,kind and likeable character overall. She knew what she wanted and made her own choices. She also supported Peter all the way and only cracked after Peter pushed her away multiple times and though it was hard she made a choice of breaking up and stuck with it until it was Peter that came back for her again. Their conversations actually felt so natural and fun unlike peter with mj who only talked about love and stuff like that. She actually helped spiderman multiple times to defeat the antagonist and died doing so. Not to mention the amazing chemistry with Andrew. Now that is the kind of female protagonist i wanna see. \n\nZendaya's MJ is also a really likable character. Very honest, also smart, savage humor, actually quirky and a bit awkward which makes the character feel very natural. She also supported Peter all the way even when the whole world was against him and also helped with spiderman stuff here and there. So yeah this MJ is also an example of a good female protagonist."

That girl has such a unique beautiful voice and is a really main vocal material but they gave her the kind of song that doesn't even showcase her voice at all. Actually yg should let Rose and Jennie write ther own lyrics because they really seem passionate about music. And if you take out all the glitz and glamour, i think she shines the most when she is just casually singing with her guitar.\n\nNow for Lisa's solo well firstly both lalisa and money's lyrics could really have been better. Because the current lyrics for money is just plain like how you don't know the ans to a question and fill the pages writing the same thing in different ways. And for lalisa well, while the chorus is kinda catchy, however i think the bridge part with the spelling out (l a l i s a) part and the (lalisa lalisa lalisa) part just feels awkward and just like a first draft you randomly write where u dont know what words to add to fill the missing gaps and just repeat the previous word over and over again to fill it.\n\nAnd since lisa is a dancer i wouldnt really expect her to write lyrics and produce music so this was teddy and yg's job to give her a nicely written song and they couldn't even do that. Plus this girl is a literal dance god and they gave her a simple and boring choreo that looks like a tiktok dance! Like what is yg even doing bruh they deserve better. i was really expecting some sick moves but yeah it was disappointing. Yg really doesn't know how to harvest talent.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/pmxw2t)"

                "body": "Alright, so I\u2019m currently playing Dragon of Icespire Peak with some friends, the other people playing are:\n\n\\-DM, I\u2019ll call him Ben, normally he\u2019s a player and I\u2019m DM but he wanted to run this game\n\n\\-Elf Rogue, I\u2019ll call him Luke, it\u2019s his first game, his character is a chaotic neutral stereotypical rogue\n\n\\-Aarakockra Monk, I\u2019ll call him Mike, he played once before, he is chaotic good I believe and kinda fucking around\n\n\\-and last session, another player joined, a Halfling Wizard, I\u2019ll call him Simon, he\u2019s also somewhat fucking around\n\nI\u2019m playing a Half-elf Bard, an opportunistic chaotic neutral merchant travelling accross the smaller villages in the Sword Coast to sell ores, travelling with a mercenary(Mike) and a good friend(Luke). When we entered the city, we sold the ores, and while Mike was fucking around, me and Luke where scamming a merchant and robbing him at night.\n\nHe suspected nothing.\n\nAfter that, we did a mission and told two dwarves at a dungeon to go to Phandalin because there was a dragon around. Then we went home, and at night, Luke robbed the mayor, that went horribly wrong. So the mayor ran outside, screaming that a demon was in his bedroom, then my character went with him back into his house to kill the demon, then I killed him, and ran outside, screaming that the mayor died sacrificing himself for the demon and that the demon fled with the mayor\u2019s money, and I succeeded. Then I rambled, saying that this could go on no longer, that Neverwinier would just send another mayor and act like nothing happened, while there\u2019s a dragon and demons around. And we should be independent, so they chose me as leader.\n\nThis was all a plan, I would rule as mayor, and try to make as much money from the city as possible, and when the dragon came, we\u2019d flee. I also sent a message to my contacts in Neverwinter, asking them to send mercenaries to aid in spreading our influence in the town(aka I\u2019d use them to kill our rivals).\n\nNext session, we met Simon, and Luke wanted to kill the two dwarves we saved to take their gold, so we went to their dungeon bc apparently they were still there. On our way, we crossed a windmill under attack by a Manticore, though initially we fought, we managed to get him at our side when the dragon would come(by letting him eat our enemies) and we\u2019d feed them the two dwarves we were going to kill. At that point, Ben said we should be chaotic evil, so we switched our alignment. And when we were at the dungeon, the dwarves were dead and four orcs sat around a campfire, Luke asked them if we could take the bodies with us, they said no bc they were gonna sacrifice them to Talos. Then I sneaked away with one of the bodies, but as we received two sending stones earlier, Luke said I should return to help him with convincing him, so I got a plan. I cast invisibility on myself, and when a fight was just about to break out, I retuned, saying that I was Talos and didn\u2019t want the dwarves to be sacrificed to me, and as a sacrifice I wanted the dragon. And as I rolled a 24 they actually believed me. So we went back with the dwarven bodies and fed them to the Manticore.\n\nThen we were back, and in the middle of the village, Simon had cast disguise self on him and slapped me, then we captured him and threw him in the cell. But, Simon and Luke had a plan, they wanted to kill me. Their first plan was to poison me, that failed as I suspected something. Then, when I went to sleep, they stabbed me in the middle of the night.\n\nSo now, my new character is gonna be the leader of the mercenaries that were on their way to the town. And he\u2019s gonna be very Ned Stark-like and bring order. I\u2019ll update the post when we played that session."

Spent hours planing it with my 14\u201d plane, and glued it up.\n\nOnce the glue dried I looked at one side and it was pretty decent, maybe a tiny gap, but nothing serious. Then I turn it over, and it is horrific. There\u2019s more gaps than there are clean joints. \n\nShould I break them apart and retry planing them and laminating, or should I try to find another use for this wood and buy straighter 2x4\u2019s? I really would prefer to use these if possible (am a broke college student). \n\nHere is the horrific underside.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/d3T7zF0"

Making the lust stronger and stronger causing inordinate affection.\n\nIn this case, when OP is masturbating, she's lusting over men's penises being all over her, something that's unclean, having sexual thoughts and high libido is normal God doesn't shame us for that, but it's very clear that the bible and God wants us to deathen those desires, not dwell on them. In case we do dwell on them, they come back stronger. \n\n**Also Matthew 3:5:**  \"But I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has committed. adultery with her already in his heart.\"\n\nPorn, especially for men, is pretty much getting off while gazing at women and sexualizing people you are not dating. Something that Jesus classifies as \"adultery in somebody's heart\"\n\nYes, masturbation is **not** directly mentioned in the bible and sure isn't classed with gross and serious sins such as fornication nevertheless IT IS NOT harmless and we can conclude from the context that it is indeed a-not-so-serious-but-still-important sin.",

I start from when I get there at 2 all the way to 5ish. Apparently the vitals are needed before 4:30 (4:30 supposedly being the latest), but I can barely get everyone done by 5 as it is, so I\u2019m wondering if anyone had ideas on what can make vital thing more efficient?\n\nI do also help with paricare and ADLs, so vitals aren\u2019t the only thing I do, but they are the most important. Especially being I\u2019m new (to the healthcare industry and working in general) this feels like a really big responsibility and I want to make sure that I\u2019m able to do it as well as possible. Plus, the ppl here are really nice about me being late, but I know they won\u2019t be for long, so I want to get better sooner as to not step on toes in the future."

She\u2019s just so self absorbed, which I get is a running thing about teenagers but gah damn she\u2019s annoying. \n\nLike this girl just cannot communicate to save her life and she\u2019s constantly complaining and ruminating on the smallest problems. Plus, even at her \u201cbest\u201d moments, or just not where\u2019s shes not internalizing her self causes drama, she\u2019s just flat out boring. Even when her friends are dealing with real LIFE shit that extends beyond just teenhood, she\u2019s over here like \u201chow am I FEELING about THEIR bad situation, gosh it\u2019s affecting ME so much. Ugh being a teenager is sooo hard for me.\u201d\n\nI heard everyone raging about how much they love her and I\u2019m curious, is it just from nostalgia value and personal relatability or is her character really that good? I feel like the only way I could end up liking her is if she ends up going through some major character development lol"

Because we casually met, I s presented them both and a few weeks later they are now dating. I\u2019m happy for them! But here\u2019s the little prank. \n\n\nSo for an extra piece of context; a few years ago I gifted Jay this monkey plushie. It\u2019s a medium sized monkey that has cute little sunglasses on. I gave it to him since I thought he\u2019d like it, and he did. \n\n\nAs in now; Mia texted me this picture of the plushie I gifted Jay alongside the text of \u201cDude, look what a cute gift Jay gave me!!!\u201d I texted Jay like \u201cdid you just gift her the plushie I gave you for your birthday?\u201d and Jay just goes \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I had to give her something.\u201d \n\n\nI got a bit mad because it\u2019s a gift I gave him for his birthday. It cost me my money and I thought it at least had some emotional value to it. Jay follows \u201cWait, are you mad? I\u2019m sorry\u201d and I was just like \u201cyeah, but it\u2019s fucking whatever I guess\u201d \n\n\nWhat follows next are texts in the line of \u201cit\u2019s just a prank bro\u201d from both Mia and Jay. They tried calling but I didn\u2019t respond either. Mia just goes \u201cjeez, so sensitive dude\u201d. I still haven\u2019t responded.\n\n\nSo, AITA?"
