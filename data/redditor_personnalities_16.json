I can also decide to not take one of my electives and instead have early dismissal. I am thinking I might do AP CSA (partially because the teacher for that class is really good). I'm not quite sure. It's still a while until I have to pick courses for next year, but I'd still like some help. I'll also take recommendations for non-AP classes for next year."

Nevertheless, I have to go to University and all the unis are in cities very far away, so I decided to rent a flat with 3 other girls there in the city. At first I was ecxited because there would be a lot of opportunities, like meeting new people and I was tired of my small town. Now I have been living there for 3 months and I can't stand it, the worst is the noise, I didn't know I was so sensitive to noise because in my house there was always silence, but here I have never heard silence, we live in an old flat so it is very noisy, each time my upstairs neighbors walk it feels as if an elephant were there, and they don't sleep at night so they wake me up every single night. Now each time before going to sleep I have anxiety thinking about how they will wake me up, then I also have a music school next to my  flat so I can hear them playing the guitar, I also hear a lot of car horns, bars, kids crying, people shouting, my flatmates... I've bought noise cancealing earphones and earplugs but the noise still wakes me up.\nAs I feel nervous in my room I try to go out but it's impossible to relax there because I find more people, even more noise, it is so ugly, all the trees seem fake. I need to go to the nature, to a place where I can look up and not see ugly buildings, there is not even sun because the high buildings block it.\nMy flatmates are not experiencing the same as me, they find the noise disturbing but at least they can sleep at night.\nWhy do I have to be so sensitive? I have to live here at least 3 more years because I want my degree but it's so hard.\n\nHas any of you lived in the city? If so what did you do to cope?"

I\u2019m currently a full time stay at home mom to a 1 year old and 8 year old. I\u2019m also a full time online student and will be finishing my associates in June and transferring to university to work on my bachelors next fall. We\u2019re being forced to move out of the place we\u2019ve lived in for over five years and rent has gone up dramatically. In order to stay within the boundaries of my daughter\u2019s school, we\u2019re looking at some places that are a bit out of our budget. So I\u2019m wanting to work but obviously have limited ability to do so without putting kids in daycare/after school care. My husband gets home at 2:30 so I could potentially do some retail job on nights and weekends but I\u2019m wanting to look for something that I could do from home before I start applying places. \n\nI know it\u2019s a big ask with a lot of caveats but does anyone know of anything I could do that would give us a little extra cash and that I could do either while watching the kids or on my nights and weekends from home? I don\u2019t have much experience (mainly retail and childcare) but my major is philosophy if that helps. \n\nMostly we just need a tiiiiiny bit more income in order to be approved for a new place. Like 15 hours a week at minimum wage would be enough! I know there are weird funky jobs out there and hoping someone might have an idea that hasn\u2019t occurred to me yet. \n\nReally appreciate y\u2019all!"

He says he cried a lot about it but can't remember the name of the comic. All he remembers is that the main character had a dog who was a police/detective dog. I tried searching it up but couldn't find much unfortunately.\n\nI was hoping i could figure out which comic it was, because his birthday is coming up and i'd like to give him a meaningful gift :)\n\nAny help appreciated, thanks!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: My dad is in his mid 50's, if it helps "

                "body": "(TW: body shaming, LGBT+ phobic, abuse mentioned)\n\nSo this is something that i have struggled with for almost 10 years now (23yo FAB) and it is a bit of a long story. \n\nCurrently writing this at 3am bc i got hit with the sudden rush of my life falling down on me and i don't think i can burden my friends with this. \n\nIt seems like all my life i have been an inadequate human being. \n\nI grow up in a well off family, at least well off enough to have food in my fridge, clothing on my back and a proper education all the way up to college. Technically speaking, i should be happy but i can't help but to feel like i am not good enough to be considered a proper human being. I was not severely abused by my family to the point of others have experienced it, so i felt as though my situation wasn't bad enough. In my head, i have no excuse to be upset about my life.\nMy parent aren't divorced but god do i wish they did. They constant break up and make up, physically fighting each other on one occasion and be all lovey dovey the other moment while making me choose who to side with. If i don't, i would be considered a traitor. Every kindness has an underlying motive to add to the kindness counter. If people are nice to me, i have to be on their side. Growing up, i never felt like i live in  a normal family. It's like i am inadequate to have one, like i was raised in something else that is not a family. \nI think the moment it became a solid realization for me was when i saw a normal family interact with each other and became genuinely confused and afraid for what they wanted. It's like ever from my birth, i was abnormal and disgusting. \n \nMy grandmother and mother constantly comment about my body. I was a chubby kid at birth and i was born with rather tanned skin, broad shoulders, tall and have thick hair, which is considered not feminine in a conservative asian family. I also hate wearing most feminine clothing, especially back when i was a kid, partially bc of my sexist father and that i genuinely prefer boyish things. But the other two would consistently reminds me of my tan skin and how i should stay out of the sun, how i should eat less to be \"prettier\" and how i need to straighten my hair out more. It slowly makes me stress eating and only eat once a day in a sort of self satisfying and self guilting cycle. Some days, i feel like everything i eat is tasteless and i just have to shove food in my mouth until i stop feeling sick. Sometimes, food is what stable my mood. Somtimes, i feel like if i stop eating, i might be less hungry. But i don't feel like i do it often enough for it to be an eating disorder. In my mind, it hasn't destroyed my life enough to be one. It's like with how i look, i am not good enough to have a disorder (which is stupid but it keeps coming back to me). \n\nAt school, i tried on many title, the \"rich kid\", the class clown, the quiet kid, the artsy kid. But whenever i try them on, i felt like i was lying to people. I was playing a stereotype that i made up in my head and not me. It felt as though i was a creature pretending to make the motion of a normal human, mimicking their reaction to gain peace and positive reaction. \nWhen i was younger, i took all my money, even stole some, to buy things for my classmates. In my mind, there is no way another human being would want to befriend something so unsightly and awkward as i was. \nThen i play the perverted class clown that makes sex jokes and too stupid to understand things but i did understand, and i did hear the things they saud about me behind my back. But playing dumb was easier than being vulnerable. \nI tried to play the smart kid, the artsy kid but it always felt as though i was overhyping myself to others and frantically try to get to their expectations. \nEven now, when i found friends that have stuck with me for 5-8 years, i felt like i never got attached to their degree. I can't imagine myself saying nice things to them in a sincere way unprompted or unyieldingly. When a friend is upset, i don't feel their sadness, just annoyed and try to make the problem stop so i don't have to handle their emotions anymore. I feel like a disgusting creature exploiting them. \nIt's as though i'm only wearing the human skin of what i want to display. A liar. I wasn't adequate enough to be their friend. My emotions and reactions were shallow and rehearsed, like i'm not even human in the first place.\n\nThen i started to discover my sexuality. I had a crush on many of my female friends from middle school to high school. However, only until i entered college did i actually thought of the possibility that i was bisexual. Before that, i always thought there was something inherently wrong and fucked up in me that makes me want to kiss and hug my friends and never let go, regardless of their gender. But then, i felt inadequate again. It felt like i didn't fit that somehow. There was something off. I felt like i was just jumping on the bandwagon of teen girls claiming they are bisexual trend (which was stupid but still). I felt like an imposter, ruining a perfectly good minority community. \"If i turned out to be straight, i would harm the community by being what biphobic people say.\" I thought to myself, and so i hid that label away, never publicly admitting to it until the recent years.\nWhen i came out as bi to my mother in secret, she tried to pushed me into thinking i was confused and just wanted to be freaky and try things... and a part of me held on to it too. I never truly allow myself to think that i was bi either. \nA few years later, i learned more about Asexuality and some of it clicked. As i take multiple tests and do months and months of research, it was clear that i was gray ace and biromantic, but again, that tiny voice in my head told me \"what if you were just not ready? What if you just want to be special? You were attracted to people before, right? So you can't be. Stop ruining people'scommunity. \" And so, once again, i felt like i wasn't good enough for that. \nThe same thing happened when i discovered about gender-fluidity. \"No matter how much disgust and dysphoria i felt about my chest and body parts, it's just a normal silly girl things, right? I don't dress in a nonbinary way or fit that group so there was no way i can be one.\"\nIt's as thought i am inadequate to fit in with anything. \n\nI dated someone for a year. She was nice, though one could also argue a but toxic as she tries very hard to have control of everyone within our friend group and prone to jealousy. After we broke up, my anxiety progressive got worse, not bc i missed the relationship or was jealous. The thought that i was a horrible gf was sinking it deeper every day. The thought of me not being loving enough or incapable of love crushed down on me. Am i an inadequate person to be loved? Am i inherently flawed to the point that i can't show love to another human being? \nI ended up flirting with many others but run away when it's time to solidify it. I felt as though i was fooling them, falsely advertising who i was. Illogical as it was, i both yearn for someone to be closed to but also disgusted of the idea of someone having to stay with me. \n\nI got officially diagnosed 2 years ago with depression and anxiety. I went to multiple therapists in hope that they will get to the core of my problem but they all seems to just tell me to understand how Illogical that thought was. But i know i was being illogical. It just doesn't shut up in my brain. \nEven with proper diagnosis, i felt like i was lying to them and in fact i do not have anxiety or depression at all. That what i say to people was bc i was desperate for attention and sympathy. \n\"I don't get panic attacks so i must not have anxiety.\" \"i don't yeet so i can't be sh-ing.\" \"i haven't commit not living so i am not suicidal.\" \"I don't break down crying in public so i can't have depression.\" \"My situation aren't as bad as others so i am wasting the therapist's time.\"\nIt was as though my situation was not bad enough to be anything. \nI am still able to wake up in the morning without wanting to cry. I am even the louder and carefree friend when chatting. I have never have a break down publicly, not even hyperventilating. It's almost like i can't even be anxious right enough to be considered as having it. \n\nThe only thing that provide me any enjoyment is probably art. I like drawing characters for DnD and other roleplay stuff. I also enjoy seeing the reaction of my friends when they see what i drew. But recently, i felt like i have become worse. Ofc  i stopped drawing multiple times in my life and it's natural that i stop progressing, but it felt like i can't adequately draw what i have in mind. It's all just mediocre. \nI don't even have a PASSION for the art. I don't do it bc i want to express myself or anything. It was for my friend's reaction. Without it, i don't even want to draw. \nSomething that i wanted to be as a child, being an artist, i ended up being suck at as well. It's like others are better at being artist than me, have better reasoning than me, more passionate than me, etc. \nI can't even be good at that. \n\nEver since covid happened, it has been having a toll on me. It wasn't a negative one, it was an enabling one. FYI, i am a teacher. I mostly teach primary school and secondary school kids and i have a side gig of being a home tutor. Recently, i have been feeling inadequate as a teacher. It's like i wasn't teaching them well enough. The kids progress poorly and constantly forgetting the things i taught them. I'm actually an impatient teacher and can sometimes be passive aggressive about repeating things that they should have known so- it's probably not good there too. It felt like i have the passion for the things i teach but not teaching. Now i felt like i am inadequate to keep my job. I have already quit my tutor side job bc of this. \n\nIt's like i'm not even qualified to be a human being anymore at this point. \nJust a disgusting creature trying its best to pretend to be one by mimicking what it thinks others do. But even that, i can't do right."

So as punishment, the Raven Queen turned their ears into raven's ears so she can only hear what she desire the warlock to hear and not be swayed by other's words. And bc of this, sometimes, the magic comes out weird since their connections are strained and off.\n\n  \nI basically stole the fun from the wild sorcerer. Sometimes, the weapon just comes out wobbly and weird looking. Sometimes, it comes out hot barbie pink. Sometimes it is on fire and deal 1d4 fire damage to the user and the enemy on the first attack. Sometimes, the sword moans when you strike an enemy. Sometimes, all that comes out are short swords. Sometimes, the weapon comes out rusty.   \n\n\nI have trouble with finding ways to make it legit and work in DnD world without multiclassing? I want to know how to handle this before asking the DM about it since i have been having this idea for a while and wanted to use it. Can you guys give me some suggestions for this?"

This has caused me to be mediocre in the efforts to grow in my career, let my hobbies die, and working only to keep up the bare minimum (bills).\n\nAfter two years, I'm tired of being sad. I'm tired of giving myself excuses, of letting the bad take me down, of wasting my time. There are many things that aren't my fault, but I do regret how I reacted to the events that led me here. \n\"I could've been better. I could've done better.\" I often tell myself, and it is true but I'm not going to drown in self loathing or grief. It's time to move on.\n\nHow I'm leveling up:\nI've contacted my professors so they are aware of my situations. I'm investing in the things I love once again like diving and martial arts. \nI've always wanted to learn Russian so I enrolled in a course and reconnected with some Russian friends I had made in college. I'm also enrolling in a career-related edx course from Harvard which will help me become more valuable in my field.\n\nI also build a work out routine and started eating right.\nI've been quite a passive user on this sub, watching more than interacting but I do thank FDS for giving me hope when I couldn't find any within me.\n\nMuch love to all the users and mods\ud83d\udc95"

I felt the pink clouds and all the anxious, romantic stuff for whole four months for my girlfriend. We got together eventually, I was the happiest ever. Our communication is like perfect,  we can talk about everything, there are almost no taboos etc. When we got together, I knew she still had a bit of attachment or like missing feeling for her ex, but I witnessed as it got better and better over the months, so I was really optimistic. Of course it hurt me a little, but I thought that in order to have a relationship to work, you need to make some sacrafice for each other. It was all okay, then after a while my pink clouds disappeared. it was like three weeks ago. Its a half- distance, half-close relationship as there are universities and such. Sometimes I get high bursts of love, sometimes its like I don't care . And although I always feel the care for her it's really creepy to think about it. I am a high overthinker and I really quickly get panicked. I am fearing if I've fallen out of love, if I will hurt her again like her ex, if I am lying to myself about my feelings. At the same time, I am think that if I put to so much thought into this then there is no way I am not caring and lost interest, if I am worried this much about her...  I am an INFP in the 16 personalities if this helps anyone lol. Would you people share your thoughts?"

We only talked about it a little before the breakup and she told me how all of her friends even were just superficial and only lasted a few months before she stopped talking to them. she treated literally every relationship superficially. Superficial meaning only jokes kinda friend, but you don't involve them in your secrets, \"real\" life, deep convos, and feelings. She said that I was the first person she had ever shared most her feelings with, and her anxiety especially. Recently she reached out to my friends to get into contact with me to talk as it's Christmas/New Years/My Birthday. We had a long conversation about it and I understand a little better, but I already have a hard time empathizing with people so it was a bit difficult. here's some text from it, I hope this helps:  \n\n\nMe: Just out of curiosity why did you have to end it?   \nHer:  It took me awhile but I just realised that I wasn\u2019t ready to commit to someone on that level. I wish I could have realised that beforehand. Like you said that\u2019s what you wanted and I knew that so I knew it was wrong to drag something out that may never go anywhere. And the longer you drag something like that out the worse it gets.   \nMe: What's so hard about committing to someone? It's not like your getting married   \nHer:  yeah but being with someone involves responsibility, like you need to communicate and be open about your feelings, you need to involve that person in your life, you can\u2019t just ghost them for a few months and then go back to talking (which is how I treat all of my relationships). and when you all of a sudden have to do all those things that you didn\u2019t have to do before and you\u2019re not ready to do you just feel trapped and stressed and awful   \nMe:  why didn't you let me help you  \nHer:  because you can\u2019t help me with that. that\u2019s something I gotta figure out myself :)   \n\n\nI really love her and I wanna get her back. I know if this wasn't an issue then we'd still be together. Is it even possible for me to help her at all? I know she is open to change but I don't think she knows how to do that. like just being there for her and being her friend will let her know that I'm not going anywhere maybe? I already asked all of my friends but no one really knows how to help. Some friends just said that it's on her, but I just can't really seem to accept that. I hate feeling powerless knowing that we could still be together right now."

Those that we see in social media, or the popular ones we know in school that we can't call as friends.\n\nThe way I see it, it's unfair because not everyone will post their negative, darkest and painful days. They won't be showing you the pain behind anything that they achieve now. People only show the world what they want to show. And apparently we don't want people to know our vulnerabilities, so we only show moments of success, our best achievements, our good and beautiful days, and the people following will think that's how it's always been for them.\n\nThat's why it's unfair, because we are comparing ourselves, whom we have all the knowledge of our own pain, problems, weaknesses, bad days, struggles, to their happiness or achievements. You are comparing your 20+ years of experience to their brief moments of success that they post.\n\nWhen you see someone with better art work than you, instead of thinking, mine sucks, she does it better. Maybe you can try to think, wow, it must have taken many years and time, and so many effort for her to be able to produce something like this now. She must have went through a hell of pain to improve her own drawing, that she's able to make a masterpiece like this. I can to if I put in the effort and time. I will do better.\n\nWell, of course, there's many counter arguments to this depending on the situation and people, but on a general note, we should realize that we are all struggling differently. Focus on your own strengths so that you become the best version of yourself.",

Just there's lots of obvious differences but we get each other probably due to me being dominant Ti which is her inferior, and her being dominant Fe which is my inferior function. It's almost like we are at awe with each other, and have a lot to talk about.\n\nAnd I also enjoy having conversations with INTJs. Super fun and chill. We can talk anything we want and have similar energy. I can be as blunt as I want with her. But when both of us are at our worse, we shouldn't go to each other. Seriously. It was a bad experience. But once I opened up to her and talked about all the things I dislike or disagree with her. And now our friendship is even more strong.\n\nWith my ISTP friend, hm. She's the best person to have fun with. Because we share similar humor, and she's the person I go to when I just wanna ramble stupid stuff and simple stuff. We share lots of similar interests like music, anime, jokes, etc. Fun cause both of us barely care about gossips etc. But not really the best person to go to when I'm vulnerable either. Maybe because I developed Fe already, while her Fe is like, a child level haha so sometimes I got hurt a lot too. but she's the coolest friend I have. Just that, she's super go with the flow kind of person and don't have plans for anything, which kinda frustrates me a bit since I love thinking about the future as it excites me more. \n\nMy ENFJ friend, hmm... She's REALLY extroverted and clingy. I only go to her when I wanna help her or when she needs me. She's the best person to go to when I need someone to go along with my emotional times. But she's too emotional... Like... sometimes I rambled some stuff, yeah it's sad but it's not like I'm too stressed out about it. She always made it sound like it's worse than it originally is. The emotions are just a bit too much, but still, cute friend. \n\nMy INFP friend, the cutest being. Seriously innocent cinnamon that needs protection 24/7. I do not know how she survived all these years. I almost take a role of a mother with her. But, she's the one who has been there the most, listening to my cries. The person I talk to about the deepest emotions. Honestly she's like my comfort pillow.

Im so scared im not sure what to do, my intrusive thoughts already make me a bit suicidal with how horrible they make me feel so im not sure if i would be able to handle another nightmare with them without breaking down completely. I've considered simply not sleeping but i have class tomorrow so that's out of question, anyone got any tips on how to not have nightmares?

It's about a man whose girlfriend finds someone else then breaks up with him, and along the song he expresses his suicidal feelings over what happened. If im not mistaken the song lyrics starts with him saying that he's inside the car at a party, then the girlfriend taps on the car window and tells him that they need to break up, i don't remember what comes after that but in some parts of the song he talks about pills, and how he doesn't know if he'll go to heaven or hell, there's also a part where he says that she takes him to their favorite restaurant and grabs his hand, while repeating the same phrase of how she found someone else. I also recall someone on YouTube made an animation of the song, i recall the animation having a lot of flower symbolism and depicting what happened in the song lyrics, but i can't seem to find that either."

He's severely autistic, and is almost completely nonverbal.\n\nMy brother has a little tablet he uses whenever he is at home, and as you'd expect, sometimes it craps the bed (whether it be due to it running out of power, wifi going bad, or some other reason). He's had many of these in the past, but he's broken so so many of them in fits of rage because he throws them and they sometimes brake.\n\nSo, whenever my brother freaks out when the tablet stops working, my dad gets pissed off. If my brother slams the door, my dad IMMEDIATELY goes into his room to yell at him to not slam the door - every single time I want to scream at my dad to NOT do that and he's only making it worse.\n\nOccasionally he will even bring me into it when I'm sitting and eating something. He will say something like \"no one wants to hear it\" and even will ask ME if I want to hear it. I always want to tell him I'd rather hear my brother have a tantrum than hear him scream anymore.\n\nOn top of all of this, _every single time_ my brother has a tantrum (no matter what causes it) my dad starts yelling at him to be quiet. He'll sometimes yell at my brother to go to his room.\n\n\nThis always makes me want to act out violently too - I have a history of self harm (which I REFUSE to talk to my parents about even though they know about it. I always shut down mentally) and I always wanna hurt myself when my dad acts like this. Sometimes I even want to punch my dad. I can't focus on anything else around me when this is happening, and I feel like I'm trapped. I can't even talk to anyone about this since this is really the only bad thing that happens at home usually. No one will take me seriously. \n\nI'm not the one even being g yelled at. I've always hid my emotions and I don't know why, but I can't even break through that when my dad is screaming at my _disabled brother_. It makes me feel weak and worthless, especially since I am so much older than my brother.\n\nI know it isn't okay, but just how bad is this?"

We have the browns, who are considered sketchy due to their filthy colour. And we have the pinks, who are outcasts of our world.\n\nIf I'm being honest, no one is treated like a human. You have to have an ID tag you have to carry around to get into shops to buy items due to some people trying to switch their colours. As a blue, it sickens me.

This is if we are willingly to give a general idea of our position or if it already has been revealed somewhat, and we need to see the other squads near us. I don\u2019t do this a lot though, but it can be useful in the right moment. \n\nDefinitely take this with a grain of salt though, I am by no means a seasoned valk main.

This was supposed to make all my current dragons on field be undestroyable and unnaffected by cards effects, and this works even if summoned on opponent's turn. But it does not. Happened twice.

But, he thinks that if he tributes MY monster, he can still use the draw 1 effect. I say that since he tributed a monster OTHER than his ahrima, he cannot do that and is obligued to draw a monster with 2000 or more attack. All because of that \"can\" in the text, insinuating that is optional and you can choose. I showed him a clip from YGO Pro showing hat as soon someone activates the effect tributing another monster, the ame instantly asks to search for the monster without presenting you the option to trigger the other effect, but he is too stubborns and says that the text on HIS card is more creditable than the game programation. who's righ?"

They recommended pick some competitive deck profiles and try to mimic it and making changes for what would be good against those decks. After researching some deck profiles and wathcing vids about good BE cards, I selected one deck to buy, to get started. That one was the kaiba deck from Legendary Box II, bc it was the one \"already built\" deck that konami sells which has the most cards from the decklist I checked. And, after aquiring it, I was planning to buy the other cards from the list that that deck does not have. But most of them were really expensive, so I picked only the ones i needed most to build a reasonable but budget deck. So, after those processes I come here with the result, asking for your oppinions and suggestions of monster I should replace or whatever, as long as I can keep it cheap.  \n\n\n\\-Monsters:  \n3x Blue Eyes W.

And I really don't want to just copy-paste a deck profile from youtube guys, or play with the infamous meta (I hear that meta is annoying to most players, and even more when it's about blue eyes).   \nMy prime objective is to be able to defeat my friends. One of them uses a really cancer Sacred Beasts deck (he bought yugi's and slifer deck and picked the OP spells and traps from them, like mirror forces, monster reborn, black hole, harpy duster, swords of revealing ligh...) and the other one uses Phantom Knights, and is planning to aquire the new Cyber strike, as well as Aromagic.  \nSo, the only thing I know is what boss monsters I want, and obviously, the Blue eyes itself, just don't know good support for them or engines to summon them quickly. And most important: How do I start? Which deck do I buy to have a good bae? Or should I buy card by card from scratch?  \n\n\n What I know it will be in the deck for now (alteration suggestions are welcome):  \n\\-Blue Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon  \n\\-Blue Eyes Twin Burst Dragon  \n\\-Blue eyes D x3  \n\\-Blue eyes alternative Dragon x2"

Especially not consistently and severely.\n\nThat, and \"love\" still doesn't excuse how insane the actions are in any scenario, inherently abusive person or not. \n\nA victim hearing this is incredibly dangerous as we have already tried everything to help them.

In 2020, the abuse situation worsened and we both drained our banks moving him to my state to save him, now over 1k miles away from his abusive family. We cut her off and anyone closely supportive or also abusive, too. \n\nFor these past two years, they have completely cut us off from speaking to his youngest brother, who is now 15; more than old enough to have his own number or socials to contact his own brother. We are still in close contact with other family and have ties to her socials to make sure that his brother is safe. \n\nShe has been arrested now 4 times over the past 2 years including this arrest, all for similar themes. DUI and child abuse, meth possession and child abuse again, assault, and now this fourth one. \n\nDuring her original arrests, she lost custody temporarily in 2020 until custody was supposedly returned to her. However around 2021, they moved out again with family members for their safety and maybe legally too. \n\nAt some point it seemed like she got her youngest, the aforementioned brother \"Bowie\" back, however became homeless and was house hopping and lost him again. He was staying with family members and she was furious, accusing her family of \"stealing him\" from her and saying \"they just should've given him to me\" while she was literally homeless. \n\nOnce she got a house again in these recent months, it seemed like he was living with her again due to the bitchfit she threw.\n\nThe lack of way to contact him combined with the multiple concerning situations we saw and were told about such as her still allowing extremely dangerous men in the house, the drug use and alcoholism, the violent fits of anger, and the physical fights she'd engage in random people with, were all massively worrying to both me and my partner.\n\nSo we compiled a report and made one to CPS. Next day, we were contacted by the police department and told she wasn't even supposed to have his brother and he was marked as living out of state with a family member. \n\nSo within 4 days, an investigation was done, a warrant went out for her arrest, and she was arrested for the fourth time. This post was made only after she was discharged after about a week and her son was again placed with another family member as she does not have custody. \n\nHer writing his name on her leg was a reaction of this; not only abusive, but peaking emotional incesty too. \n\nLastly, I want to say thank you to this community for the immense support you have given us over these years of abuse and giving us a place to tell our story and advocate. It will never go forgotten or unappreciated. \n\nAnd if at all you are going through anything similar, please do not hesitate to reach out to me for help or advice. Or if you have any questions, I will always be glad to answer. \n\nThank you all. <3",

She lost custody of her children twice, but we weren't entirely aware of the situation as we moved 1k miles away from them and cut her off. \n\nHowever, we found out his youngest brother (the one in the post) was still living there and that she was continuing to endanger him and there was drug use, physical fights around him, etc. So we were obviously very concerned for his safety.\n\nMy partner and I built a report and called CPS to make them aware of the situation. Next day, we got a call from the police station asking about the situation, and also notifying us that his brother was marked as living out of state and was not supposed to be living with her. She did not have custody.\n\nSo within a few days after that call, a warrant for her arrest was made and she was arrested. She was in jail for a good few days but was discharged for reasons we do not know. \n\nThis situation is never-ending, heartbreaking abuse. I share to tell our story and to help others in our shoes. As always, thank you for the support from all of these years I have shared here.

I am afab but I am nonbinary.\n\nI don't really want to write out my whole life story to justify this suspicion, so I'll try to keep it short. I've struggled with intestinal, stomach, weight and other issues from the time I was about 10. I've had three other people born women tell me that their stories were identical to mine, all of us getting invalidated by doctors, given a half-assed diagnosis for IBS, and only getting a legitimate diagnosis way later in life after much pursuing, persuading and after seriously having to push and fight doctors for one. \nAll of them have told me my symptoms and story is identical to theirs and that it is highly likely I have Crohn's too. \n\nThis, combined with the fact I had a colonoscopy a while back that only showed \"inflammation of intestines\" and that I recently learned my father has been told he has Crohn's led me to believe I do as well. \n\nI have not been able to push for a diagnosis or treatment recently, as I have a lot of other health issues I have been trying to pursue, but now as I am going into college and desperately trying to find a job, I've run into a large problem. \n\nDue to both Crohn's and a leg issue, I cannot stand for long and I cannot maintain a reliable schedule; the two things every no experience, easy entry job requires. There is literally zero remote jobs that would accept me either, and I desperately need one. \n\nSo I've opted for diagnosis and applying for disability instead. Could anyone please guide me through the process, and also tell me how much you get a month through disability for anyone who is applicable? \n\nThis advice would be especially helpful from anyone that was in similar situations to mine; like born female or diagnosed late. Thank you very very much for reading and for any applicable advice, it is all appreciated greatly.\n\nEDIT ----\n\nThis post is pretty much closed now as I think I've received all the advice I needed. If at all you have anything to add that has not been mentioned already in the comments, feel free to do so. \n\nAs for me and my situation, I will take one person's advice of trying to apply immediately post-diagnosis, then going through a lawyer to exercise my options. I cannot work otherwise. \n\nThank you all for the support and advice, it is all appreciated greatly."

However, her and his abuser (his mother) both kept his childhood guitar from him. For months, his Nana had said she had it (as he had left it at her house when he moved.) and would ship it soon. She kept putting him off as well as making excuses, and for a while we believed her. Up until recently where she told him she didn't have the guitar (she gave it back to his abuser apparently) and had to get it, and he told her either she can ship it immediately or he will be filing a police report against his mother for theft. \n\nSurprise surprise, she still hasn't sent it or even told him where it actually is and when it'd be shipped, so now we have to resort to filing a police report, but the situation is so complicated.\n\nHow do you file a police report from across the country? How would we send them the images for proof? What can we expect from this process? Any and all answers would help a lot. Thank you for reading."

Experimenting helps too, reaching out, making new friends, getting really good at things. There might be nothing but the more you are active the less time is spent doing nothing which is boring. Maybe take up trucking when you're old enough for your cdl, or something like walking if you live in a safe area. I don't know what else could help, everything's boring, you just gotta distract yourself enough that you forget that you're doing something. Stay busy",

                "body": "Me(18M) and my girlfriend(19f) have been dating long-distance for 8 months. Honestly as soon as we hit things off before we started dating and when we finally got together it's like something in my brain changed. I had always still looked at other people as potential people, or was stuck on my exes, ect.. but at the end of last year I had made a mental change, I was no longer reliant on relationships to be happy.\n\nSo when we got together, I actually learned to trust her, for once my eyes laid only on her because it was more of a choice. I learned that I loved her, I've wanted her more than anyone else, she's treated me better and with respect which I had never experienced before. I've always wanted to move in or closer because I miss her, she was not and is not ready so I had dropped it. Recently I've found myself wanting it again, I know not to try to force her, or convince her, that it wouldn't even be that great for her if it's not her choice.\n\nThe thing though is the difference. Texting is enough for her (or she's been saying she feels the same about wanting to move in the last couple months which surprised me) but for me I need the physical nearness, the connection from things like hugs. I know I made the decision to get into a long distance relationship, and I'll stick with it, but I don't know how long I can.\n\nWe call, we try our best to see each other, we talk to each other as much as we can. She says now that she wants nothing more than to live with me because the distance is hurting her too, she just can't get herself to because of her family. (She gives rides to school to her little brothers(14 and  16, older brother not wanting to get a license, 15 mile drive) and her parents need her for chores like taking care of chickens, she isn't fully ready to leave them yet either). Her telling me these things have made my hopes or emotions about it rise. I've always been willing to do things like move closer or have the financial burden bc she also wants to save up.\n\nShe wasn't comfortable with things I used to do normally with my friends, I gave them up because I wouldn't want her to continue something that made me uncomfortable (friends and I used to do sus things but only ever platonically like cuddling or \"flirting\" while gaming and I can see where she's coming from) but I've lost my friends, I'm not really intimate with anybody but her now and we see each other once or twice a month. I don't know how to continue like this. If she was here and I could have hugs and stuff from her like it'd be okay, but I barely have friends, barely have physical affection (platonically or in the relationship due to low visitation) it's like she's the only person outside of my family I talk to or keep up with, and even though she wants to be together, wants to move in, she isn't. She has a full family that's healthy and supporting, I don't. I don't have anyone near me anymore besides co-workers and family and that's not what I need.\n\nHow do I get past the pain of being alone while I wait for her to be ready? We had a move in date set to a day in January because of our 1 year anniversary, but she's saying she might have to stay longer to be able to keep driving the brothers. So not until May or June or July. I can't force her obviously, and I don't want to leave her, but I'm getting more depressed and lonely every day. I have an exhausting job; it's affecting my mental health to the point of physical health too and I'm lost on what to do. I've tried telling her how I feel and my situation to try to at least see her more. Do you have any advice? Please.\n\nTl;Dr - Me and my girlfriend are long distance, I could handle it for awhile but lately it's been too much for me mentally and I'm at a loss on how to cope with being alone while waiting for her to be ready. What do I do/what are my options?"

At an auto parts store job, obviously broken expensive cars can be a reason for someone to get angry, but,  when people came in yelling at me calling me stupid and shit. It brought me back to when I was younger. I went completely quiet and couldn't speak and could barely move and for hours I had to organize or stock the back because I couldn't talk to any other customers. In chdhood that was like, how I didn't get hurt is being quiet and alone.\n\nThe problem is my partners whe family is very loud and it seems like yelling is their language. I can't be around them.

But my friend was like \u201dI can\u2019t just be fuck buddys and talk this much to you bc I\u2019m gonna catch feelings\u201d. She told him that but he didn\u2019t really listen, he kept on texting her and stuff (just wanna add it wasn\u2019t like obsessive texting, my friend replied and they had normal conversations so it wasn\u2019t in a creepy way)\n\nAnyways when she understood he wasn\u2019t gonna respect those boundaries she told him that they have to stop hooking up because she\u2019s gonna catch feelings otherwise. But then he told her that maybe he would consider dating her. He has told her that he likes her, and not short after this whole thing they became exclusive, so obviously after this my friend thinks that he thinks that he is ready for a relationship and that things are hopefully heading towards a relationship. \n\nBut this guy has has told my other friend recently  (bc they are also friends aside from being f-buddys) that he is still thinking about his ex and that they are not gonna become a thing.

I also want to add that my friend isn\u2019t lying about this, she\u2019s not that type of person, and she doesn\u2019t have any feelings and she has gotten the ick pretty much from this guy.

My friend who told me this also has trust issues and she trusts me so I don\u2019t wanna do that, and it would also put her in a shit position. I\u2019m not sure if my friend has feelings yet but I\u2019m scared that she will get really hurt and she also has some other personal issues going on. I don\u2019t know if I should just become more and more negative towards this guy and point out more and more red flags and push her to push him to tell her what he feels and are thinking etc.\n\nEven thought this is really shitty of this guy he\u2019s really nice otherwise, and he likes my friends personality and I guess it\u2019s maybe naive but in my mind there\u2019s still a slight possibility that this guy will get over his ex and catch feelings for my friend so idk."

But I believe he\u2019s kinda a bit of a fuckboy and gets bored or whatever. \n\nAnyways, about a month ago I noticed something was up with his account and about a week ago I understood it was because he had deleted it, which I thought was a bit weird because he was on that app a lot. Then I thought that maybe he had gotten a new account and I have tried to find it but haven\u2019t. Then the thought came to me that maybe he has a catfish account. (I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a common though or not but I have certainly thought about getting a catfish account) and then I was like \u201cwhat if we are already friends or what if he has added me. Then I saw an account that had added me that matched all of the information. \n\nThe information that matches:\n\n-they\u2019re from the same country (and you can\u2019t change which country you\u2019re from or make people not seeing it) and maybe 4% of the people I come across on the app are from that country. \n\n-The account isn\u2019t verified, and no social media or anything stands in his bio\n\n-the guy on the picturea is someone you could easily find on someone\u2019s Instagram with a smaller following. My crush is probably objectively slightly more attractive but the guy is still kinda attractive ig and if my crush is your type then this guy is probably also your type.\n\n- so then we talked for a bit and they write pretty similarly, and he wrote to me first.\n- I asked for his Instagram and he left me on open.\n- you can watch lives on the app, and I have never seen this guy watching a live or being very active on the app, still he has either found my account by watching a live or searching for my account.\n\nLike it\u2019s not like I\u2019m convinced that it\u2019s him, and ig it\u2019s also a bit of wishful thinking, but is it really that impossible?"

I know it\u2019s maybe selfish but I would feel too bad, I\u2019m also like kinda in similar circles as him, so would like to not make him dislike me, even though I\u2019m almost willing to risk it at this point to make him stop talking to me. He has recently started to point out things that he doesn\u2019t like that I do (nothing toxic, more so that I\u2019m low key rude and never serious and that I take too long to reply) and that makes me so uncomfortable. I have (maybe stupidly enough) said that I will try to change those things, instead of being like \u201cthat\u2019s just me and if you don\u2019t like it then leave it\u201d but yeah\u2026\n\nDoes anyone have tips on things I can do/say to make him stop talking to me, without being too mean or having to say that I don\u2019t like him?"

I\u2019m gonna read a math class later which is apparently pretty difficult and see how well I do there (bc if I think that\u2019s super difficult I\u2019m probably not continuing with this idea)"

Story's name was \"*Skater Boi*\" I think. Story was about two boys named Kage Xender (?) and Ash... I think? (I don't remember his last name). Ash's female friend's name or nickname was V, I belive. Those boys were going at school, Kage was skater and was riding motorcyle.  \n\n  About a story... It will be chaotic because I don't remember much, there was one time when Kage guy draw graffiti on Ash's wall, he also fight with some people broke his hand, Kage's parent's were divorced, he was complaining that he will change place soon. What else... Oh, he had a friend named Blaze... Blake? something like this. There was a moment when when Ash, Kage, Blaze and one guy went... I don't remember where, but I remeber that Kage asked Ash boy to go in Blaze's car because he (Ash) was sleepy and it was dangerous for him to be on motorcycle with Kage. And he, in fact, fell asleep. I remeber Kage woke him and 4th guy with strong sound. There was some drama going on between them while they were there. And I remember that Kage was scared of worms, had a snake tattoo, and had greenish or bluish eyes.\n\nI think that's all I remeber. Can someone tell me where can I read it or how it goes and/or ends? \n\nThank you everyone!"

If I feel the \"surge\" of 10mg Ritalin very helpful for starting things I don't really want to do but need to, would that mean Ritalin would be better for me in general? Or would it be something like the precursor symptom of getting addicted/building up tolerance to methylphenidate?\n\nI am also on Effexor for comorbid depression, which I got diagnosed before the adult ADHD, if it makes any difference."

It\u2019s so weird too because even right now, saying that I can have sexual interest for women just horrifies my brain as if I\u2019m a terrible person or predator.\n\nIs this common at all?

I mentioned my previous relationship with my friend, which I guess came across the wrong way. I noticed she was a bit upset. She said it seemed like I cared more about my friend, seeing as it was bothering me so much and I had to spend time by myself instead of  time with her talking about it.

I feel like this was a good opportunity to give us a deep violet or dark maroon goddess (add some more shade variation in what is currently a limited godly pallet).\n\nI just feel that after all the waiting to see how Psyche looked as a goddess, it was anti-climatic to just slap some wings on her and then call it a day.  \n\n\nIs anyone else thinking Psyche deserved more? or is this a me thing."

However, the gist of it is that I'd love to have a family of my own: I had a difficult childhood (my parents were abusive to me and I no longer have any contact with them) and never got to experience having the warmth and comfort of an actual functioning family. I do visit my partners familly with him from time to time, and it's such a joy to see them being so loving, cohesive and kind towards one another and I would love to have that for myself as well. I'd also want to have a family specifically with my partner as I love him so much and I believe he'd make a great dad too. I feel like we both think it's rewarding and truly amazing to raise, teach, guide and love a child(ren) from being a newborn all the way up to adulthood and beyond. Furthermore, I'd like to experience pregnacy and childbirth at least once and just have that family life together. \n\n\n\nThere you have it. I'm very curious for your opinions/stories!"

I know there is a mod to research a cure, but that takes months in game I think, and I would like an option that's a bit quicker.\n\nI don't know, what do you guys think about it?"

I decided it was mcdonald\u2019s, it shouldn\u2019t be too bad and ate one. By the time I reached the second one, my jaw was already a little tired and I didn\u2019t wanna eat the second one. After debating whether or not I should politely ask for another one with my friend, I go back up to register. I waited patiently for the worker and she came over and asked me what was up. I just explained that my bagel was hard and asked if i could get another one if it wasn\u2019t too much trouble. She threw it away and told another girl to make a new one. I waited again and an middle aged woman with a pixie haircut comes over to me and starts talking. \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad if your food isn\u2019t right, you\u2019re the one who paid for it. We have to hand stuff back to them all the time.\u201d  My eyes widened a little, I had never met a true karen, but she had the dark roots with the short, blonde hair and the self righteous demeanor. I gave an awkward chuckle and she continued talking about how I should be more demanding with them. My new bagel finally reached the counter and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been happier to get my food and sit down. Anyways, it was just something strange that happened to me that I thought would be enjoyable on this here subreddit. I\u2019ve only ever been on the receiving end of Karen\u2019s BS, never the one she\u2019s giving advice to. I felt bad for the workers at mcdonalds for having to put up with her."

That\u2018s why I\u2018m neither aware of the struggles of packing, nor the feeling of using/removing one. \n\nBut I understand all of your reasons and some of them seem even a bit relatable. So, who knows, maybe I\u2018ll get into tucking as well\n\nAlso, concerning the post-op thing I said, my logic was pretty much the following: If a person gets bottom surgery, they can\u2018t just take off their dick every time they dislike having one. I didn\u2019t mean that tucking with a packer isn\u2018t just as valid. It is by all means. It just made me wonder why it isn\u2019t preferable to remove the packer, when that possibility is available.\n\nAs I mentioned in another comment, I was neither aware that femboys tuck nor did I consider the possibility of tucking for it\u2019s own fulfillment. I saw tucking as a (allegedly very unpleasant*) way for transfems to temporarily remove their dick if they dislike having one. Needless to say, that perspective of mine changed now and I\u2019m very grateful for everyone that helped me broaden my horizons.\n\nI\u2018m deeply sorry if my comments offended you or even made you feel invalidated. It really wasn\u2019t my intention. I was just genuinely curious.\n\n*All the people that I witnessed talking about tucking claimed that it hurts or that it\u2019s really uncomfortable in a way I cannot imagine\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m a dumbass, why didn\u2019t I think of that?

(Here\u2019s the [taimi wiki page](https://taimi.com/wiki/aboy-what-is-it-what-does-it-mean), since miraheze is currently down.) Either way, everything is better than people assuming I\u2019m female. \n\nAs for the legal gender options, there\u2019s 4 in my country: male, female, diverse or just removing the gender marker entirely.\n\nInitially, I figured that I\u2019d just let it get removed since that represents my gender the best. But recently I started worrying that people may see a missing gender marker as an invitation to assume it. That they might interpret \u201cI have no gender\u201d as \u201cI don\u2019t care what gender you see me as\u201d. \n\nAnother issue is that there\u2019s no gender neutral way to address a person formally. There\u2019s just the equivalents of Ms. and Mr. where I live. Which makes me wonder, what am I supposed to be addressed as? Obviously, I prefer Mr. but am I really allowed to write that in official documents? Do I really get to choose? What if they force me to go with Ms. unless I change my gender marker to male? \n\nSo all in all, here\u2019s my problem (TL;DR): I prefer removing my legal gender but I\u2019m scared that people might assume I\u2019m female and/or force female terms on me unless I change it to male\n\nWhat would you do in such a situation?"

It\u2019s been ingrained, albeit slowly, into the modern American psyche, as our kids are being taught to treat others the way they themselves would like to be treated (golden rule). \n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case back then, however, when growing awareness to civil injustices, especially racial inequality, were often dismissed by those whose self worth is dependent on maintaining the status quo (conservatives). \n\nThe problem we have today, then, is not of cognitive dissonance, but rather a language problem. Those \u201calternative facts\u201d people have corrupted our language and made \u201calternative definitions\u201d and \u201cmeanings\u201d to words like \u201cmorally superior\u201d and \u201cwoke.\u201d To be labeled any of those things is the equivalent of being \u201cuncool\u201d in their eyes. Kinda reminds me of high school culture, where the bullies, delinquents, and academically-challenged, instead of changing themselves, would rather dismiss the entire system as a whole, (sore loser mentality), and ridicule bright kids whose accomplishments make the dim ones feel insecure. \n\nSo, the next time someone calls you \u201cmorally superior\u201d as a form of insult, just remind yourself that their vocabulary is filled with \u201calternative definitions.\u201d No useful discussion can come from two people using different dictionaries. If they\u2019re old, it\u2019s unlikely that what you say will amend their wrong definitions which might as well be set in stone. As for the young, misguided people out there, I still have hope.",

Every day, I see ppl who are uninteresting to me carry out conversations successfully.\n\nI think they're simply rude for interrupting or ignoring you, but it's also possible that you haven't made it clear that you're invested in the conversation. Try to speak loudly and clearly, stand up straight, and make a lot of eye contact. For some ppl, starting/continuing conversations doesn't come naturally and it's a skill they have to learn.\n\nRemember that real-time overthinking about how the conversation is going is usually counterintuitive. Try to focus only on what is being talked about. Like *that's* what's important, and the rest are just distractions.\n\nOne of the best ways to start a conversation is to ask for a person's opinion on sth. Then you can extend the conversation by asking relevant questions. Let it branch out. (But try to avoid questions that are too personal, or they'll refuse to answer or give short replies.)",

The fact that you're yourself with him is a plus, cuz ISTPs don't like fake ppl. They like honesty and authenticity.\n\nI've heard many ISTPs say they think ENFPs tend to be... high-maintenance; that they talk a lot and ask for a lot of attention, and that they have to be too careful not to hurt their feelings. There's also the high Fi which might lead to clashes. BUT! It is absolutely possible for ISTPs to like ENFPs. I've seen users who wrote they were in an ISTPxENFP relationship or even married. I'm actually an ISTP who is usually attracted to ENXPs. The talking and high energy doesn't bother me at all, unless I'm in a very very bad mood, which I think is the case for most humans.\n\n>How can I be sure an istp guy likes me back ?\n\nThe \"dos\" vary among ISTPs, but I suggest that you avoid the \"don'ts\" as much as possible, since they're more common among all ISTPs. Like don't rush into it, don't play games or beat around the bush, don't get passive-aggressive, don't lie (ever), etc. I'm sure you can find more info on r/istp, this sub, and r/MBTI.

I was so scared of making mistakes and not being the perfect golden child I was raised as, that I preferred to avoid a situation completely, than to interact and not do sth flawlessly.\n\nBut it's been a few months that I've started to allow myself to make mistakes and to not always try to be the best. I basically changed \"What if I come off as dumb?\" into \"Let them think I'm dumb.\" And that drastically reduced my social anxiety."

Even though he didn't have any other symptoms, they tested him for Covid, flu A, flu B, and strep since they have been seeing a lot of those 4 lately. His test was positive for flu A. We just went through the same illness with my 11 yr old who was sick from Nov 16- 20. He had much worse symptoms and was never offered tamiflu. This Dr yesterday prescribed us Tamiflu for my 7 yr old and said he could go back to school if he took at least 2 doses. I was unable to get the med last night because the line for the pharmacy was 25 people long so I took my kid home and tried to go back but this particular location closes before the others and I didn't make it in time. when I was telling some of my friends about this, they said their kids had terrible reactions to tamiflu and that since my child does not have bad symptoms I should skip it.  I really want him to be able to go back to school soon and the Dr said that could happen if he took it, but since he has no fever and no other symptoms, I am really struggling to see the benefit.

It's by going through the trials their brains/bodies adapt and create the framework for one of them being viable to form a cure. Thomas was one of the most likely candidates they watched, probably along with Minho.\n\nTeresa was controlled a LOT by wicked in both the books and movies. It doesn't really go in depth in the movies but wicked could literally take over a person's body and force them to act or say certain things because all the kids had brain implants. \n\nThomas could communicate with Teresa telepathically on and off throughout the books, implied it was due to the implants. Teresa could also communicate with Aris, and Aris with Sonya. There's also a time where Thomas and Brenda talk that way. \n\nI highly recommend the books!",

I've never been to an event like this before and I'm so grateful I got to come home for the first time. \n\nI LOVED the silent disco, that may have been my favorite part of the entire thing. Next year I'm totally gonna camp the weekend and dance the silent disco all night. \n\nTo everyone that gave me gifts, you're magical and ily. I made kandi to give out, if you got any of mine I hope they bring you good vibes. I traded my first kandi necklace too, thank you forest fam, for making my experience great. I only got a taste but I'll be back for more next year without a doubt. \n\nSeeing porter on saturday made me so emotional and it was so needed. I went mostly solo this year and I have social anxiety so it's hard for me to meet new people. A really cool set of people adopted me for the day and I'm so thankful for the comradery and trust and love.  \n\nThank you forest fam. I'll see you all at home again next year. If anyone wants to adopt me for next year, or if any fellow solo'ers wanna make some new friends for next year, hmu. \u2764 I'd LOVE to make some new friends this year to go to more edm style events, but you have to promise to dance your heart out with me.\n\nedit: anyone going to north coast(?) in chicago?\ud83d\udc40 in september"

Is this true? Does it apply to single day parking and/or GA parking? What's the fee for day parking?\n\nIf so, does anyone wanna hop in my car Saturday so I don't have to pay that.

                "body": "So just a quick vent. \n\nI'm afab, 24, and just recently realized I'm at *least* genderqueer and possibly trans ftm. (I'm currently okay with any pronouns while I explore, though.) There's a lot I'm glossing over here, but I needed to scream something to the internet void bc I have nowhere else for these feelings to go. \n\nI've mentioned very very briefly to a close friend irl that I've been really questioning my gender. I've been questioning for years now, but finally admitted it to this friend. \n\nI had long hair my whole life until I realized I didn't feel like me anymore with long hair. So like two years ago I chopped it to my shoulders and that helped, for a time.. And now for a year I've been dying to chop it short. Like I want a 'boy' cut. \n\nI told the friend I wanted to do this, and his immediate reaction was to say, \"I prefer when you had your long hair.\" I didn't ask for his opinion in any way whatsoever, but he blurted this out when I had barely finished speaking. That.. hurt. I told him, \"But I don't feel like *me* with long hair.\" And he was aware of the fact I had been questioning my gender. I told him I wanted to change my name and pronouns.\n\nFast forward a bit, to yesterday. We're hanging out and I saw someone with the haircut I have been wanting to bite the bullet and get (but have been too nervous in case I get questions or attention about it. Also, I exclusively wear my hair up now, with it bunned in the back so in mirrors it looks like I have short hair. That's been helping alleviate dysphoria. I wear it up like this at work too. Anytime I forget or am lazy and wear it down *everyone* comments on how they like it down. This makes me so uncomfortable that I run to the bathroom and tie it back up). \n\nAnyways, I see this person with the haircut I have wanted for forever now. I point it out to my friend and say, \"Look! See that's the haircut I want. I think I'm gonna try to cut it this summer..\" and he, *immediately* says, \"I miss your long hair though.\" \n\n...\n\nAnd this is *after* I made him aware of how it hurt the first time he said this to me. I was so.. angry and upset and just.. done. I just wanted to shut down. It made me feel like I can never come out about this to anyone because if he, who's supposed to be a good friend to me, does this insensitive shit.. then what if everyone else does, too? \n\nWhy can't I just have a close friend that supports me through this? That reassures me and gets me excited about it? People that validate me?\n\nWhat I kinda wanted him to say was: 'Oh, super cool! I'm sure you'd rock that haircut. And if it makes you feel more comfy, that's all that matters and I support you. I'll have your back if anyone says anything shitty or intolerant. How you identify is valid and I'm here for you.'\n\nNot that it would have to be that.. in depth. Even just a, 'Oh cool, I love that!' would have been nice. \n\nI just.. don't have any queer friends irl right now so I feel like none of my friends are gonna understand. I'm not getting the support I need, that I'm looking for, from anyone around me right now. I know I shouldn't rely too much on others, but it would be so nice to have *someone* I could talk to about it and feel free to be *me* with. \n\nMaybe this is silly but I just.. needed to get it out. I needed someone to hear me. Thanks for listening."

Like, instead of thinking \"I will now start studying\" I think \"I'll stand up now, go to the place were my books are, take them, sit back down, open the right page, ...\" This can help, but like you might've noticed since I write this right now, it doesn't always. The only recommendation to motivate yourself to study you get is to listen to music, but that doesn't work for me since listening to any kind of music is a full-attention activity for me. There are some things I can do while listening to music, like for example cooking or baking or cleaning things, but it doesn't work for much. Another thing I want to try out in the future is have a habit of doing a specific thing every time before I study. Like watching a certain video, reading a certain article, whatever, and then always starting to study. I don't know if this will help, but maybe you can try this, too!",

Some time ago, I've seen someone tell that they were told to always look into the eye of the people they are talking to and that they took it literally which apparently confused the people around them. So if I don't completely misunderstand this, it would mean that when people say \"eye contact\" that they are talking about looking into the face of the person you're talking to. But I've also seen someone explain that they fake eye contact by looking at other parts of the face of the person you're talking to, which would mean neurotypical people actually look into the eye. So I'm a little bit confused, am I supposed to look at the face of other people or should I actually look into their eyes?"

However I still question my gender all the time, and I know with 100% certainty I am definitely not a boy, and recently I have started to consider that I might be a trans girl, but still in the process of fully accepting it. I have heard that it is fairly common for asexual people to later come out as trans and then realise that they only thought they were ace because they weren't comfortable with the thought of having sex in a body they were super uncomfortable with. And especially because I use the microlabel aegosexual this is really starting to make me think this could be me. So I just wanted to ask if anyone else has had a similar experience."

Initally when I started doing PVP for the first time, I slowly made my way up through the leagues at a fairly normal pace. After a few days I managed to make my way into the master league where things obviously became a lot easier because I could use any pokemon that I wanted. However, what I didn't realise is that you move back down to the great league at the start of every new season without the choice of being able to play in the other 2. When I first played in the great league, it was painful but I still maneged to win about half of the battles I did because at least I was up against other people that were very low level like I was at the time. However, now that I'm back in the great league it's become a huge problem because my PVP rank (or whatever it's called) is 18, so I am up against people of a similar level. I have played about 20 battles in the new season and I have lost every single one of them, because I just don't have good enough pokemon below 1500 CP. The only reason this wasn't an issue before, is because everyone else I was playing against was also inexperienced so it didn't matter that I didn't have any good pokemon. Now however, I'm starting to fear that I might not be able to make it into the ultra or master league for a really long time because i don't have any pokemon good enough to win battles against other people of my level. So the biggest thing I need to know is, do you move up the leagues just by playing battles, or do you actually have to win them?"

As of April this year, I have really been getting back into it, but of course a lot has changed since 2017 so I have some questions as to how things work now.  \n\n\n1. Shadow pokemon. Is there any advantage to keeping them, or is it better to transfer/purify them? I know that purifying a shadow pokemon gives it a CP and IV boost, but I've also seen a lot of people say that it's best to keep shadow pokemon the way they are, so I was wondering how I know what to do with them when I get one.\n2. How do I get Umbreon, Espeon, Leafeon, Sylveon, and Glaceon? I have evolved about 10 Eevees since I started playing again, and i just get the gen 1 Eevees every time. I can only conclude that there is a specific thing you have to do in order to get the others, but I don't know how. I already have an Espeon and an Umbreon, but it's been a while and I forgot what I did to get them.\n3. Sinnoh stones and poffins. Two items I find myself in constant need of, but I don't really know how to get them. Occasionally I get some from research tasks, but they are pretty few and far between, so I was wondering if there is a more sustainable way of getting them.\n4. Why are pokemon with low attack good for trainer battles? I always try and use my highest IV and CP pokemon for battles, along with the ones that have the best attacks. However, I have seen pretty much everyone say that the lower the attack IV is the better it is for battles. why is this?"

                "body": "It's been roughly a little over two years since this happened. Earlier that day I had taken a tab of acid and went to school and had a really fun time just messing around in my graphic design class and kinda zoning out in english. I got home around noon and decided I wanted to really trip and have a good evening. I had done dxm once before, roughly half a bottle of delsym but I wasn't really sure on the dose. I decided I wanted a bit higher of a dose so I would aim for the third plateau. For those unfamiliar with the plats, 1st and 2nd are the most common doses and are like a psychedelic drunk feeling. 3rd plat is where it becomes like an actual trip with closed eye visuals and 4th is like the dxm khole. I looked up the dose I would need for a 3rd plat trip and the website said about 900mg. I had mostly come down from the acid so I didn't think it would affect my trip much so I proceeded to swallow 60 dxm only gels and turned on some tv for the come up.\nI think I'm a bit sensitive to dxm so I think I took more than I needed and I also think being on the comedown of the acid made it a 4th plat trip because a half a year later I took a smaller dose and it was how 3rd plat is normally described.\n\nAs soon as I felt the come up I instantly knew this wasn't like the last trip. I felt so nauseas, I stumbled into my bathroom downstairs and proceeded to puke my guts out. I kept puking even when there wasn't anything left, and just kept dry heaving. My stomach hurt like it had a knife in it. I was feeling super dissociated, I rested my head on my toilet seat. My head felt like it was on fire, I could barely move my arm to scratch my head, and as I scratched it felt like knives dragging across my scalp. At this point it was hard to keep my eyes open and behind my eyes glitchy computery visuals covered the backs of my eyelids while a white noise washed up and filled my head. I felt like I was watching a glitched out windows 95 screensaver. At that point my consciousness collapsed into a single point that was moving along a line of computer circuits that were my brain and I knew as soon as it reach the end of the line I would die. I thought that the geometric lines was the kill code that my brain was executing and I would die. My nose was filled with a smell that I had never smelled before. It smelled like chemicals and just terrible, and I knew that was the smell of death. I would go in and out of consciousness and I remember seeing my dad standing over me, apparently my dogs had found me and started barking so he came down to see what was happening. He tried to talk to me but I was so gone I could barely understand anything he said. All I remember saying is \"I think I'm dying\". I fell back into the computer world of shapes and the next thing I knew I felt myself say an answer and then I'd come back into reality and the paramedics were there, and they then asked me a question that I had just said the answer to. Two of them held me by the arms and helped me up my stairs and into the ambulance. I could see everything that was happening before it would happen and then I had to follow that path.\n\nOnce I was in the ambulance they started driving to the hospital. In the ambulance I asked the paramedics if I was dead, and they said no, then everything just kinda stopped and it was like there was a scratch on the dvd of my life and this one second kept repeating but getting more and more glitched out and I felt my consciousness drift and I became the ambulance. Then suddenly I felt myself fall upwards and jump into a new body, I knew it was about to die because it was hooked up to all these machines in the ambulance. Everything felt so different and it didn't feel like my own body. Then I fell back into the world of shapes.\n\nI was dying and reality was collapsing like a computer program. I was just a color moving in a conveyor belt of other colors and shapes moving in a specific pattern and I could feel myself squeeze through the other colors. I heard a voice tell me I'm going to be ok. I saw myself being looked at through futuristic medical equipment while all of space was falling and being reloaded with the incorrect textures and then I fell back into darkness. After a while of just falling into darkness I fell back into my body but it was hooked up into life support at the hospital, at this point I knew all of life was just experienced in some kind of simulation inside the hospital but I was out of the simulation because I was dying. I would die and just come back into another body right on the brink of death and I was stuck in the hospital forever. Then everything zoomed out really far and I saw hundreds of rooms of other patients all in some kind of confinement. It was all part of some futurist anti-dxm tv commercial and my whole life was just to show other people how taking dxm would kill you and destroy your brain. Then I fell back into my body and I was alone on the hospital table, naked, and hooked up to some beeping machines. I had double vision that was so bad it was like there was a giant slice missing from the middle of my vision and everything was blurry. I thought I was going to be stuck like that for the rest of my life and I had actually fried my brain. Then my parents came in and told them I was so sorry, my words slurring and barely understandable. Soon a nurse came in and said they were moving me to the normal hospital rooms now and I would be ok. At this point reality was coming back to me and the nightmare was over. I asked what time it was and it was about 5-6 hours since I had dosed. So most of the time I was blacked out or in the world of darkness and shapes. They moved me into a room where I would stay the night and I tried to get some sleep. The next morning they let me leave with a giant hospital bill.\n\nI tried to write everything I could remember and describe but I'm sure some memories were forgotten, especially the parts where I would enter the world of darkness and shapes. It was also hard describing the experience because to this day it was the most intense thing I've ever experienced. I've done Dmt, ketamine, lsd, and others and nothing compares to what I experienced there. I had some ptsd for a while but with the help of acid and ketamine it's pretty much gone now. I'd like to try that dose again with a better set and setting and with a trip sitter to see what it would be like properly but I don't think that will be for a few years. Anyways thanks for reading my story."

There are 2 cards in the center of the table between the two players and the other 20 cards are split up into 2 stacks of 10 on each side of the two cards. The players play their face-up cards onto the two cards in the middle, one higher or one lower like in speed and can flip over crds under the ones they play and move them to fill empty spaces if they use all of a column.

He's very kind to pretty much everyone and overall good looking, and while he's at the first year of high school, i'm at the last one of middle school which separates our break (09:40 - 10:00 for me, 10:30 - 10:50 for him).\n\nWhile we do have friends in common, he's still somewhat distant and we never really talked to each other (besides from the one time when he asked me to sign a petition for a project). What complicates that even further is that his father is quite literally the mayor of the city (small/medium interior mountain city so the high class isn't necessarily separated from the rest like in the big cities) and I'm pretty sure he's right-wing leaning, so maybe he's homophobic. I have absolutely no idea about what to do or how to approach the guy helppppp \ud83d\udc80"

                "body": "Hi all,\n\nI have a 2010 Volkswagen Jetta with \\~70K miles on it. I have been the sole owner of this vehicle. \n\nAround 45K miles or so, the original stereo died and, after a while, I had it replaced with a non-VW stereo. This coincided with a dead battery.  (I can't remember which exactly came first, but the stereo started acting up around the same time I replaced the original battery.) I've also had off-and-on issues with the automatic door locks not locking or not unlocking. Then, around 65K miles, my second stereo died in a similar fashion to the first one. (Blipping on and off, making a \"ticking\" noise, then completely dying.) I acknowledged its untimely demise and my husband removed the fuse to make sure it wasn't able to impact the battery.  Most recently, I let my car sit for a few days while we were out of town and I came back to another dead battery.  \n\nI've down some research and, as far as I can tell, these electrical issues are common to 2010 Jettas but everyone seems to be struggling to get help from the dealership.  I've seen online references to it being a grounding issue and, separately, a wiring harness issue in the door lock. Could either of these be the root cause?  \n\nAny thoughts or expertise you may have are much appreciated. (And thanks for being mechanics!  We would all be lost without you!)"

I will likely try to schedule a J&J shot under medical supervision as this is okay per CDC.  \n\nUPDATE #2:  It took a while to find a safe location (doctor's office) for proper monitoring (after that first experience), but I received a J&J vaccination approximately 6 weeks later and had zero allergic reaction and all side effects were normal (chills, fever, and fatigue that lasted about 24 hours).\n-------------\n\nHello all. I'm 39F with interstitial cystitis, IBS, anemia, and rosacea. I had my first Pfizer dose yesterday morning and, days prior to the shot, I had been working on a gut protocol for h. pylori and large intestinal dysbiosis. (I put it on pause for the shot.) I also have several food intolerances and suspect an autoimmune disorder, but have not been diagnosed with anything yet.\n\nSymptoms: I felt okay during the 15 min wait time but started to feel a little weird on my drive home (sensation in the crook of my arm, a little tired). At 30 minutes post-injection, I started with abdominal pain that immediately turned nausea and vomiting.  I also spiked a fever so quickly that I busted out in a full-body sweat and needed to remove clothing to help regulate. At one point, I also got hit with diarrhea and was vomiting while on the toilet. (Sorry for TMI.)  This continued for about 1-1.5 hrs. The rest of the day, I had normal-ish symptoms, albeit moderate, like sore arm, moderate fatigue, mild chills, etc. \n\nI wasn't expecting to do well because I'm aware that my immune system is a over-reactive, but that was pretty scary and I was taken aback by what happened.  I'm now afraid to get shot #2, but really want the greatest immunity I can get. Any thoughts and or advice on that front would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks and congrats on getting vaccinated!"

Apakah karena sistem yang lebih rumit (E.g settlement T+2, transfer keluar yang rada rumit and etc). Satu teori yang saya pikir juga adalah jumlah Investor/SID di Indonesia masih sangat sedikit -> less news coverage.\n\nGara - gara kejadian yang baru ini aku juga penasaran kenapa Biometric/Hardware 2FA belum menjadi standar atau setidaknya menjadi opsi.\n\nOiya sebenernya aku bikin thread ini karena pingin discuss topik ini  dan mendengar opini para Komodos.

And if so, how severe it will be?.  What kind of attacks that might happen to older iPhones?\n\nI am considering buying a new iPhone if it's security implication are crucial but it will be a waste since my iPhone 7 is still working perfectly without any lag or major issues.\n\nI also had practiced several good OPSEC practice (trying to at least haha) so this post purely asking  the security of the iPhones it self instead of the user/human.\n\nAny experience or insights are welcomed,  \nThanks in advance."

                "body": "Wanted to ask and start a discussion about BCA Optima Insurance as recently I had call from BCA and asking me to join insurance (sigh), after lots of arguing I managed to deny it and I noticed some red-flags which are as follows : \n\n1. Cannot/deny ask for buku polis/product detail reference, while BCA clearly has a website of reference [BCA Optima](https://www.bca.co.id/en/Individu/produk/Investasi-dan-Asuransi/Bancassurance/AIA-Optima-Accident-Protection), first time got offered insurance through call and is this normal? Usually I met the agent on person and can ask tons of information which most agent happily do it.  \n\n2. 75% of capital will be returned after a certain period, which I presume this is a unit-link insurance?, Tried digging information but still don't get clear idea. Personally I already have various kinds of investment therefore for insurance I want maximum protection and doesn't expect the capital to be returned.  \nI already had insurance personally, but suggestion and recommendation is welcomed.  \n\n3. Apparently this is a BCA \"exclusive-insurance\" and can only be registered for BCA customer, uh okay ..... but when I insisted registering in through the nearest KCP BCA the caller insist that it is only available through phone.  \n\n4. Unclear benefits/protection that is offered, I have read website but still not sure about the detail. Do you get the benefit after death (Asuransi Jiwa) or the insurance bear the cost of the treatment process (Asuransi Kesehatan) ?\n\nWhat do you guys think about this? God-dang as an introvert I spent 1-2 hour getting drained because of this call and my day is ruined. Now I have no energy left except for browsing reddit.\n\nOh ya for fellow BCA Optima user perhaps you can elaborate more specifically for point No.4.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance, \n\nBest regards."

My idea so far is to buy Legion 5 w/ Ryzen 7 + GTX 1660Ti/RTX 3060 and install Linux (Ubuntu is my choice rn, but I might change later) and Windows for some work application and games , So it's a dual-boot setup. Even-though the majority of the time I will be using Linux.\n\nI was wondering if anyone would like to share their experience. Pros and specifically cons/issue since i might learn a thing or two from you guys. After some research i will feel at home when using at Linux for my workflow since i come from a Software Dev perspective but my biggest concern is the software driver (GPU, CPU, Mousepad, and etc) which i heard is be a deal breaker. Do you think Lenovo Legion with Ryzen processor will fit with Linux well? Any feedback is welcomed\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance !"

This type of false connection is tenuous because, as you said, it relies on maintaining hatred and negativity to persist. If one person begins to set boundaries, be more loving, or question the judgment, the entire connection will crumble and fail. It is by definition a toxic relationship. \n\nSadly, many emotionally immature parents don\u2019t know how to connect with themselves or others and they pass their toxic habits like this one on to their kids. Some psychologists call this \u201cemotional incest\u201d: when parents share negative information and seek emotional support in developmentally inappropriate ways from their children. \n\nMy mother was the same way. We have no relationship now because she is in a cult and all she knows how to do is lie, manipulate and judge other people.

I loved how heart-wrenching some of the storyline was, and the ways the characters created deep community with one another. I loved how honest the main characters were and how they really cared about each other over time, even going from rivals to friends. \n\nAre there other shows like these? Maybe by the same or similar writers and directors? Ones that show the unfairness of life with characters that build real friendships and community and help each other through dark times? Ones where characters develop and change for the better? Where they show mistakes and consequences and how they deal with them? Social issues are brought up in realistic ways? Ones with idealistic characters too? Great dialog and acting from an ensemble cast? \n\nI feel so sad to finish these shows\u2014 I wish I could forget them and watch them like new again.

This surprised me because Cash App specifically says that the Cash debit Card can be used internationally and even gives a list of countries where it can be used. Of course, this is an issue so I reached out to Cash App support through their app to find out how to fix this issue\u2014I had friends and family send me money in the app before I left and I want to be able to use my card to spend it\u2014this is a perfectly reasonable expectation of any financial institution. \n\nWhen I tell you they are the worst, I am not speaking from a place of having American Express customer service (arguably the best) expectations. Talking to their support was like talking to the most awfully programmed bot. At a certain point I believed I was talking to a bot because the responses were so far out of left field I could not imagine a human being giving that particular canned answer to every question, repeatedly asking me for the same information. Once I asked if I was talking to a bot, the representative became rude, condescending, and crazymaking. \n\nOne example is that I said I tried to use my card in a physical store and the transaction was declined and they asked me to attach a screenshot of the transaction. Wtf kind of human being would ask that in response? So I go online on my computer to try to use the card just to get a screenshot to send, and I send it and they respond super rude telling me I should never send my financial information electronically after they literally asked me for a screenshot. Another example is that I had said the card was \u201cblocked\u201d as figure of speech because it wasn\u2019t working, and the person/bot was like \u201cwhat makes you say the card is blocked? The card is not blocked.\u201d Lmao! Like , I\u2019m, yes it is blocked if it\u2019s being declined for every transaction. That\u2019s literally what blocked means.\n\nAnd at the end of giving me completely unrelated non-answers to the questions I asked, like telling me Cash app pay can\u2019t be used outside the US when I had made it clear my issue was with the Cash app debit card multiple times, they would of course end with \u201chave I resolved all of our questions and is there anything else I can help you with?\u201d. \n\nI was never rude to this person but an hour into this when they ask me to send screenshots again for the third time, of course I was frustrated because my questions had not even been addressed at all. At the end the representative told me if the Cash app can\u2019t be used outside the US, that applies to the debit card as well, which directly contradicts what Cash App says about the Cash card in the app *and* on their website. \n\nApparently cash app doesn\u2019t train their cash card support people to resolve international issues, and they can\u2019t see the full list of transactions. If the card is declined there\u2019s no way for the support people to see that, they can only view successful transactions, which isn\u2019t helpful for resolving problems related to the card not going through.\n\nApparently Cash app support also has a policy against saying \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d  Nobody knew the answer to my problem but they simply responded by telling me to stop asking the question and go away and then talking down to me like I was an idiot. Through all this I was very patient and polite because I used to work in a call center and I get it- sometimes people ask a question you don\u2019t know and can\u2019t figure out. I did give some feedback that talking to the person was frustrating because they weren\u2019t actually addressing the questions I asked, and it felt like I was talking to a bot because they kept giving canned answers that weren\u2019t related to the issue I had originally asked about.\n\nI eventually asked to have my request escalated. Some manager named Yazm\u00edn came on, talked down to me by saying to just try all my failed transactions again, and then completely stopped responding.  I even asked if she could provide me contact info for the bank that partners with Cash app because perhaps that\u2019s where the issue was coming from. No response.\n\nThey as good as told me that if I can\u2019t use my card outside the US, I just need to wait till I come back. I\u2019ll be gone for 6 months so that\u2019s not a good enough answer. They never offered me any solutions, and could only give canned responses that weren\u2019t actually related to the issue I had. Then they became rude like I was an idiot for bringing a problem they didn\u2019t know how to solve. \n\nI googled to try to find out how to file a complaint with Cash App for this because ultimately I do want to get the issue resolved, OR I want Cash app to update their card policy to say that the Cash debit Card cannot be used internationally. You either *can* use the card or you *can\u2019t*. If it\u2019s not working, they need to figure out why and be able to see enough information to resolve it. I only have been to countries on their list of approved countries, which I also told the support advocate multiple times (although they ignored this and kept directing me to check the list repeatedly), and my card has still never worked outside the US, even online, even using a VPN. The Cash App website says to file a complaint with them I need to contact support through their app! What the eff?\u203d if they are ignoring me, that means I can\u2019t file a complaint, obviously. \n\nThis was the worst customer service I\u2019ve ever experienced, where they as good as said that if I ask a question they can\u2019t answer I should just go away or they will ignore me. \n\nSide note, **how can I file a complaint?**\n\n**Can anyone give the customer service contact info for the bank that partners with cash app so I can get to the bottom of my issue?**"

Others that come to mind are Abraham asked to sacrifice his son, Jephtha's daughter, and God's commands given to the Hebrews through Moses to kill entire cities people in Numbers, including the children to offer to God. I imagine there are more.\n\nIn the churches I was raised in, these were (with much cognitive dissonance) explained & rationalized away. We were told Abraham was never *actually* going to have to kill his son, he just needed to be *willing* to (???). Jeptha's daughter stayed a Virgin forever (???)). The babies in Canaan were somehow evil and corrupted due to being not Hebrew so killing them was better since babies go straight to heaven (???)... Jesus was basically intellectualized into an archetype and symbol, somewhat ignoring he supposedly *literally died* died and we were supposed to be eating his skin and drinking his blood to be saved from God's wrath...\n\nNow I realize these are shoddy explanations, but as a kid, I believed. Most Christians openly claim human sacrifice is evil and god never wanted it. They won't admit the Bible's god demanded human sacrifices multiple times. They obfuscate it in intellectual rationalizations and sometimes in outright contradiction to the text.\n\n*What cognitive dissonance did your church use to explain away these human sacrifices? Did your church explain them away, OR were they honest that god needed human lives and blood spilled to be appeased?*\n\nThis should be good!"

                "body": "Reading bell hooks book **All About Love** clarified this for me. I don't believe love is simply limbic or emotional attachment, I think its more complex and deep than that. In the book, bell hooks contrasts love and 'cathecting', where cathexis is an emotional investment (attachment) in another.\n\n>\u201cWhen we feel deeply drawn to someone, we cathect them; that is, we invest feelings or emotion in them. That process of investment wherein a loved one becomes important to us is called \"cathexis\".\n\nI believe what most people call love in modern times, including for their children, is actually cathexis. bell hooks goes on to define love:\n\n>Love is not a feeling. Love is an action, an activity. . .Genuine love implies commitment and the exercise of wisdom. . . . love as the will to extend oneself for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth.....true love is an act of will that often transcends ephemeral feelings of love or cathexis, it is correct to say, 'Love is as love does'.\n\nShe also delineates care, and caregiving from both love and cathexis. It is very confusing because, at least in English, we use \"love\" interchangeably with care, compassion, enjoyment, affection, fondness, cathexis, possession, attachment, and all sorts of words that mean very different things, so people can even confuse *abuse* or *neglect* for love because we use the word love for everything! We are taught to assume love is automatic between parents and children. And \"love\" in English has no universally agreed upon definition. So in her book, bell hooks sought to actually parse out what is *love*, and how is it unique to all these other things.\n\nThis book really clarified for me and helped me come to the conclusion, as bell hooks also shared in her book she concluded: *my parents and family did not love me*. My parents (and hers, and possibly yours) were emotionally immature and they did not have the skill or capacity to truly love themselves or anybody else, including me. They didn't even know what love was! In fact, they probably had never experienced love before. Their parents did not love them either. That is how they were able to emotionally neglect me, abuse me, and disregard my needs and still feel they \"loved\" me.\n\nBecause my parents were not committed to their own soul's development and emotional growth (i.e., they didn't love themselves), they never progressed to a place where they could love me or anyone else. To this day they would say they love me, but I don't have to believe that because I understand that they don't know what love is.\n\nIts hard to process at first, and I definitely recommend reading the whole book because there is much more depth and beauty in it. But reading and understanding this also gave me hope because it helped me see that this is a boundary for me in any close relationship. I will not stay in any attachment with someone who doesn't love me, meaning who isn't actively investing in my growth and development of my soul. I am learning how to actively love myself and others. And I am not willing to accept cathexis in place of love. \n\nI have committed that I will not call cathexis love anymore. I don't say my parents loved me. I correct people who tell me that my parents loved me. I want to be loved in the way bell hooks described, and I want to truly love othera as well. Some people never get there though, and that means those people aren't for me, including my family of origin."

If not feel free to remove.\n\nI see a lot of posts on this sub and other subs (like r/raisedbynarcissists) about estranged children struggling to navigate allowing their children to have a relationship with their abusive, neglectful, or narcissistic grandparents. They may encourage their partners or siblings to talk to the estranged parent(s) without them, send baby photos, arrange grandparent visits, or  allow their kids to go alone on vacations with grandparents that they don't speak to.\n\nI am no contact with my parents and  presently childfree although I had a dog years ago. My golden child sibling often would leave her dog with my parents when she traveled and said her dog loved being there, so once in a pinch of time and money, I asked my parents (after being LC for 4 years) to watch my puppy when I went away for a day trip.  At first they refused, but when I brought up how they watched my sister's dog all the time they agreed. \n\nLong story short, when I came back from my day trip, I found my puppy tied up in the rain in the mud outside my parents' house looking completely demoralized. I was incensed! I cried when I saw him and felt so hurt which I expect was their intention. My dad- an abusive pedo-narc when I confronted him had no remorse, he looked with dead eyes like he did nothing wrong. My mother defended my dad and said in the future I should just board my dog. \n\nI knew at that point that my parents would treat any creature, or any future child of mine exactly the way they felt about me, except that a puppy or child would have no agency to defend themselves or understand why they were being treated so abusively. My parents are *abusive people* -- that's their *personality*. Yes they had hard lives and yes they were victims of abuse. But they *choose to be abusive*. Imo they are not *owed* any semblance of relationship with any children I ever have simply because they are my parents. Growing up, watched my parents be abusive to my neice (I was a child still bc my brother is a decade older), badmouth my brother and his wife in front of her, and try to indoctrinate his kids into the cult they are in. My older brother used my parents for childcare because they had my neice in high school and couldn't afford daycare. My parents even cut my nephews hair before he was 1 year old one day after their mom expressly told my parents not to. \n\nAfter that, my brother and his wife continued to send their children to my parents house to visit for years even though they didn't speak to my parents because \"the kids should have a relationship with their grandparents\". Once my neice was old enough, she refused to visit. My brother never asked her why.\n\nI have been very confused by my brother, and also reading this subreddit, why people who are NC with their abusive, neglectful parents continue to insist that their children should have a relationship with their abusive grandparents, and why they send pictures, or give partners permission to talk to their parents and share anything about their lives? It feels like cognitive dissonance to me. \n\nWhy are these terrible parents owed a relationship with our children? *They are not safe people.* Our abuse and neglect was not a fluke. Our parents personalities don't change just because we have kids. We are NC because of egregious violations of boundaries, emotional neglect, gaslighting, and cruelty. Why do we think our parents personalities will change, and give them access to vulnerable children who can't defend themselves just like we couldn't?\n\nThis is a genuine question because I don't understand. I want to hear the reasons. I will never have bio children, probably because of the damage from the CSA I experienced, but I have considered adoption and I am very curious why most people would suggest that I let the child(ren) have a relationship with known abusers."

Some people in my community organized a fundraiser to help get me housed and it has been overwhelming to say the least. In just 24 hours, the fundraising goal has nearly been met. I was not prepared because I did not expect to even get close to the goal. Nobody I know has any money.  Everyone seema stressed and stretched. I just didn't expect the generosity.

I've been doing somatic work for two years all centered on Trauma and pain. I've hit nothing but obstacles until today. Its overwhelming.\n\nI'm so grateful but I didn't know getting support doesn't just hit refresh, that has to be something learned also. Any advice welcomed."

This is how cycles of abuse are allowed to continue. \n\nThese enablers do things like share photos of us without our consent, or share our phone numbers, social media posts, and location with our abusers behind our backs. They may evem or undermine our kids and tell them \"grandpa loves you\" behind our backs. They don't respect our boundaries and expect us to not speak up. They make us dread family gatherings and repeatedly guilt trip us to \"reconcile\" with abusers to keep the peace.\n\n**Its ok to cut enablers off and go no contact even if the most they have done is not stand up for us.** Even if they say they love us and tell us we are important and they want us in their lives. Even if their feelings are hurt, rhey cry and tantrum, and they blame us for being stubborn, selfish, or intractable. *Emotional safety is just as important and physical safety.*\n\nAnd if we can't completely go no contact due to being reliant on them for basic needs like housing, we can grey rock. We can refuse photos, and not share information with them. We can refuse to engage in family gatherings.  We can block or unfriend them on social media..We can choose to be an impenetrable fortress to their prodding for information to share with abusers under the guise of \"caring about us\". \n\nBe liberated to cut off anyone who enables or denies abuse, including their access to our emotional labor, creativity, gifts, information, and support. This is Self-preservation!"

I also am realizing how remarkable it is that I left so early and young.\n\nI know a kot of survivors can't watch the documentaries or listen to the podcasts because they find the information too triggering. Somehow I find that its comforting to learn how various groups worked, even though I understand that documentaries are intentionally sensational and extreme. I just want to understand, mostly, how people get recruited and manipulated so I can understand how that happened to my parents who then raised me in a cult and shunned me when I left. I believe they will die in the group and I will spend the rest of my life without genetic relatives in my life. Even though I grew up in the cult, and I understand the rules, their behavior seems so extreme and foreign to me. Hearing these stories has helped me understand them a little better."

I don't know the laws in France, so I don't know what is legal to discriminate on. If he was never convicted, does it show on his criminal record, and can employers deny employment based on an accusation where he was not convicted? In this case, I hope so. I would argue that even though he wasn't convicted, there is a history with a long-standing employee, and I would not want to hire someone who would cause tension at work.\n\nI am so, so sorry this happened, and you have every right to request a ban in place, but without telling someone, it will be impossible. You could wait and see if he is ever hired and then address it or talk to someone now. If you are willing to leave your job over it, I would totally understand. \n\nIn the US, they teach us to inform security of any outside conflicts that could escalate to workplace violence. I think this would count. You don't feel safe with this man around. You could request that he not be allowed on the grounds.

My husband presents with disorganization, taking on more than he can handle, easily overwhelmed with details, and needing constant stimulation. \n\nUsually, our symptoms fit together really well. He is great at juggling bills and planning time for when things need to happen, esp leaving the house on time. I am great at building organization systems for the home and planning our social lives. It works for us very well. \n\nWe have been together for a decade and only last night discovered something about him. For weeks (months?) I have been reminding him to take things to the basement. We have a small space and have to stay on top of clutter. Otherwise, it is not usable space, and I get massive anxiety. It never seems to bother him, though. He always shares the workload around the house, but it genuinely perplexes him why clutter is so stressful for me. \n\nMost of the stuff that needs to be put away are things he has brought up from the basement for some reason, or new stuff he bought that need to go down. Whenever I am doing laundry or whatever, I grab a few items and put them away, but it is the holiday season, and there is just too much crap to keep up with. \n\nSo last night I asked him again, please put away all the things. He honestly said, \"I know this frustrates you, but I genuinely don't know what you mean. Can you tell me, what things are you talking about?\" I was so shocked, I just started pointing to everything and rattling off a giant list of stuff sitting on shelves, counters, the floor, his office, the living room ... all that junk that has been stressing me out.\n\nHe just blinked and said, \"Oh. Yeah, you're right. All those things do belong in the basement.\" We then had a heart to heart that he literally doesn't SEE clutter. It isn't that he was ignoring me, or that he prefers a messy home. It is just that the visual cue doesn't exist! It doesn't even register in his brain that an object is out of place. \n\nAll our other symptoms coexist really well, except this one. Staying organized is how I manage myself. It is a coping mechanism that I need. Otherwise, it triggers frustration, which then turns into emotional disregulation, which then affects productivity in all aspects of my life. (Work too, since I work from home.) His office is a sty, and he has tried many times to keep it tidy. His side of the bed always has tons of junk on the bedside table and floor. If I make a system, he can follow it ok, but I can't manage everything. \n\nI know many of the supportive folks here struggle with organization, so I thought I'd ask you all: what things help you stay on top of the clutter? Is this common for someone to simply not see an object right in front of them? Anyone else have a similar situation?"

Many of these difficulties you face come from your environment and society, it\u2019s not just you. \n\nHuman interaction can be downright exhausting for you if you don\u2019t know how to have fun around people, if you feel anxious or uncomfortable easily. You can\u2019t avoid it or else you will lose all your social skills, but you can\u2019t force yourself through every interaction, or else they will lose quality and nobody will enjoy talking with a pessimistic downer. We have a responsibility to ourselves to take care of us even when we\u2019re at our worst. And our job is to make sure our energy levels don\u2019t stay at zero. When you are feeling down, it becomes very obvious what lifts your energy up and what brings it down. Go into every interaction, leave and examine your thoughts/feelings down to the root cause. When we have scarce energy to share, we know the people who we can count on the most. For me, that\u2019s my mom, because she always reminds me of how inspiring it is to stay optimistic and smile through your worst days. Nobody likes staying around pessimistic people who talk about themselves, are boring. If you think other people don\u2019t like talking with you, make an effort to figure out what they want to hear from you. You got this.",

Exploring is definitely underrated, and I think not enough people decide on a build they like and [enhance] it. I think the reason is because different levels in different areas require us to use different builds. The development you put in your INT stats you have pre-early game are emphasized based on completing missions clearly rather than exploring the lore extensively, lore which I hear a lot of us speculate in mid-late game. The reason exploring builds fall off by mid-game is because balance builds begin dominating the meta since they spend a lot of time consistently investing in skills and abilities they frequently use. \n\nYour play style now should be the one you wish you played better in previous levels.

I have invested in some personal skills in athleticism like stamina and kinesthetics that don\u2019t make me gold in the real world. In a RPG world where everyone is investing for a bruiser build and I\u2019m customizing my character for health, I can\u2019t help but feel like I have no offensive or defensive capability. \n\nI play in premade randomly assigned groups and have not found a team that I enjoy playing consistently with. As of now, I have forced myself a little to stick with some teammates I found tolerable, and I realize they don\u2019t reciprocate the same enthusiasm towards me. \n\nI have a lot of gold to invest in skills over time, but I have a [window browsing] debuff and a [impatience] debuff that makes concentrating on the future pretty hard. \n\nIn my lvl 30s I hope I can find a stable source of gold generation to keep my character alive, a team to stick with for the rest of my life. Currently, I\u2019m investing time in skills and specifically my building capacity is spent on meeting players around the local map and adding them to my \u201conline friends list\u201d.\n\nTo make my character better equipped for making a team and keeping it alive, what are some tips/observations/advice that other higher leveled players can give?"

There are many instances in the Bible that are divination-esque and many times God points us at other ways (not just saying divinatory type things) to honor Him.

Personally, I feel you took a quick look at my \u201cbio\u201d (again you don\u2019t know me so how can you say I\u2019m not what a \u201ctrue\u201d Christian is??) and drew some conclusions based on my response to fit your rhetoric in response to my comment. \n\nAt the end of the day, everyone on Gods green earth is a sinner and there is no hierarchy to sin in Gods eyes (your equally a sinner as a serial killer is\u2026 I know a lot of people like to see it as what\u2019s a worse crime but sin is sin is sin..), so I kindly will take my understanding of God and my relationship with Him, and continue to let others know that you can be a Christian and still read tarot or astrology for advice\u2026 it\u2019s when one looks to divinatory tools as THE higher power that it becomes unChristian-like in action.",

I truly appreciate this subreddit, Mods, so continue your great efforts with this page. \ud83d\ude43 If others want to continue giving more advice and stories pleaseeeee do bc this has been so helpful to my mindset.\n\nOk, all\u2026 I (30F sub/brat/collared) and my Dom (and fianc\u00e9 30M) were in the middle of oral sex. He was eating me out and as I came, I\u2026 tooted. \ud83e\udee3 He didn\u2019t even act like it happened, but noticed how mortified I was and told me \u201chey, stop it.. I love you\u201d and continued. We enjoyed the rest of our time together and went to bed, aftercare etc. \n\nThe thing is\u2026 I know he didn\u2019t care and that it\u2019s just a bodily (mal)function in an extremely awkward intimate moment. I love that my Dom is so loving and supportive and again, it didn\u2019t even stop his desire for me. So\u2026\u2026.. why am I still absolutely mortified by it and now super self conscious about receiving oral again? \n\nWe have since had intimate moments and all those times have been perfectly business as usual (not to sound unsexy bc it has been sexy lol). So this silly incident really isn\u2019t something that has put a damper on anything\u2026. Except my view towards myself. \n\nAdvice?!?! Thank you so much for any support and comments!!"

                "body": "Hi All!\n\nI just was curious about Trance Mediums / Shamanic Trance practices, specifically where a spirit guide (perhaps many) is made known to the medium/psychic (and maybe even for an extended period of time/months/years) as benevolent and can essentially \u201ctake the drivers seat\u201d of the medium\u2019s body for a period of time. \n\nGeneral knowledge?\nHas anyone experienced this? Or witnessed this in some form, preferably with someone you know you can trust to be truthful?\nWhat was it like?\nWhat did you/they experience? Before? During? After?\nDid you/they have any physical symptoms after? Positive? Negative? If so, what? \nDoes this frighten you/them?\nIf you/they have a partner/significant other, do they know about the spirit guide(s)? If so, How do they feel about them? Have they interacted with your guide(s) through you as a middle person, or directly through trance mediumship, or both? Does it help or hinder your relationship?\n\nThank you to anyone who answers any, some, or all of these questions!!!!"

It\u2019s been very weird and confusing trying to wrap my own thoughts and tendencies around my head but I feel that this is something I want or maybe need, as I\u2019ve been feeling less confident in my identity and when left alone to my thoughts. It may be because I have been consuming lesbian media recently and have observed myself being inspired to have such thoughts where I am in a romantic and sexual relationship with a female as myself being a female. It is certainly a more attractive notion than other permutations of a relationship to me. But it\u2019s just so weird that I want this and cannot understand the dynamics of this. How? Why? What? How do you classify this? Is this possible? Anyone else feel like me? And how do you get this dream to become real? Because whenever I think of this, it\u2019s just a breath of fresh air and I really want this more than anything because I\u2019ve been really feeling down lately and this is the thought that seems to cheer me up and become more hopeful despite the challenges to actually make it work due to my environment.

It was something vaguely about a guy and a girl who were forced to live in a spaceship together because the Earth was now frozen or destroyed or something along these lines, the male protagonist had flashbacks of his family celebrating something at one point. \n\n\nAcross the space they meet different aliens and in an episode a blue one asks the guy private questions about his and the girl protagonist's relationship (she was sort of a love interest but acted like a tsundere throughout the show, I recall) the male protagonist assumed the alien guy was into her. At the end of the episode there was a plot-twist that the male blue alien is a hermaphrodite and turns into a girl at certain periods of the month and he/she was actually into the guy. The ending song of the anime was super catchy.\n\nI've found so many cartoons and animes I never thought I would hear of again and now I really need this one but it seems hardcore level I don't even know why. If I find this one I will honestly start crying. I might remember a lot of things wrong but the hermaphrodite alien part is correct I KNOW it, it marked me as a kid."

I started a MBTI meme page on IG (link to the page in my bio) not that long ago and looking to start another one for rock/metal memes so I\u2019d be ecstatic to find someone who wants to jump on board. Gender doesn\u2019t matter, but preferably someone close in age at least. \n\nAnyways, a bit about me now. I love listening rock, metal, punk, post punk, and indie music. I play an exotic instrument.. well actually I\u2019m still learning, but I\u2019m getting there. I\u2019m into dark and dry humor so steer clear if you\u2019re easily offended. Lastly, I am an INTJ and a Virgo if you\u2019re into those sort of stuff. So yeah, hoping to meet some cool people here and I\u2019d be seeing you in the DMs."

Most places only have them starting at 39 or even 40. I tried to go around this by looking at children's shoes, but it seems like most of those have, at the very maximum, 35 (which, despite being only a size too short, is terrible for my feet).\n\nThis appears to be the case with all kinds: boots, trainers, dress shoes, etc.\n\nDo cis men just straight up jump from a 35 to a 39 during puberty? Where are all the 36-39 shoes? And most importantly, does anyone have any advice on how to find shoes?\n\nAny help appreciated!"

After presenting a rebuttal to each of their arguments they just brought up a previous one and the conversation felt like an endless loop, with us mostly disagreeing on which side science is really on.\n\nAt the end of it, we each decided we would compile studies defending our position and send it to the other so we can have a more educated argument next time (since this one came up pretty spontaneously and neither of us was prepared and with sources at hand, as this was face to face).\n\nI know of a few studies and pages I am used to link others to online, but there are a lot that I have read but not saved. I will do my best to track them down, but I also wanted to ask if anyone could share any really good links to studies, articles and research papers they've come across that might be useful in educating someone who is willing to change their view.

You might say i am overreacting, but, in my opinion, people play video games to have fun, and, when they have to fight to possibly gain your enjoyment, there is a problem with the game itself. Lately, this is exactly what i feel when there is a doomfist on the enemy team. The game stops being fun. An enemy doomfist just doesn't let you play casual anymore. You either switch, or, do your own and hope he kills your team and not you.\n\n\nI know it might sound silly, but, I feel so offended whenever i see someone getting  random oneshot by a doom. I have spent more time on than any of the other game combined, and, I absolutely love the overwatch universe, and, story. Long story shot, i am too connected to this game, But, the fact that this game allows this hero to perform the way it is, to me it feels like a personal attack. Howcome, me as someone how cares so much about this game is feeling like he got slapped on, real hard, by the very thing he loves so much?!?\n\n\nI am legit on the edge of quitting this game. Not because of the lack of new content, but, Because of this nonsense hero. I apriciate you blizzard team. I really do. But, please!! fix him or Remove him. He is no good for the game. \n\n\nsomeone please hear my begging and help stop this nightmare of a hero ):\n\n\nEdit: why me as a gamer is supposed to struggle with a doomfist trying to kill him to have fun, instead, of just enjoy it?

We need 6 stuns, to look at the sky and hope that maybe we can stun him before his bullshit abilities insa kill someone. Playing sombra allso doesnt work, because, he can land on the supports kill them and leave faster than the time to hack. \n\n\nThe most upsetting and annoying thing i have ever witness in any game i know about. For fuck sake, i just want to mess around in qp and play hanzo or something, but, i have to change to allow my teammates to play the game. Its absolutely awful design. \n\n\nPls Blizzard! Do one thing for me and for this community. Change doom and make him less annoying to play against. I dont want to see anyone getting random one shot by a hero falling out of the sky. I dont to counterswitch every time. And, if you cant do that just remove him. \n\nI love this game more than any other game, but, when dooms get in the picture its just upsetting me, and, making me keep wanting to quit the game.\n\nDoom has Cool looking design, cool story, fun gameplay, but, against him is auful.

Seeing the teasers made me change my mind because it seems like we'll actually get new content, not just the same boring stuff we've read before. Also I'm a sucker for the guys POV. I can definitely see how this would be tedious for a lot of people and I totally respect that, but I have mourned the loss of the FBAA book 1 dynamics (ESPECIALLY book 1 & 2 Kieran) and I'm so excited to be getting that back. VoFaB is not one I'm excited for necessarily, but mainly curious. Though I don't particularly care about anything from Willa's POV (We barely know her as a character. Come on JLA!). I think it would have been smarter to release the Cas POV book, FBAA book 5, and then VoFaB after including Willa more in both previous books. However, I think her release strategy is great from a cash-grab standpoint. She's trying to stretch it out as long as possible before she finishes Casteel and Poppy's arc, because once she finishes that, a lot of people won't bother reading the add-ons and novellas, but people will read anything she puts out when they're desperate for even a crumb of their favorite characters. (I know I would lol.) Sorrry I wasn't expecting it to be this long, and most of this is probably information you did not want, but those are my thoughts.)",

I support people's freedom to wear whatever they want and I know that clothing doesn't have a gender.

                "body": "I just messaged one of my childhood friends, and found out one of our other (past) bestfriend moved\n\nFor some sort of  background, in elementary I became friends with this one girl, G, and through her I met my other (past) friends, L, M, S, and A. We were best friends, and stuck together (my school had two classes per grade for native spanish speakers and we were all in the same spanish class through out, except G, she was in the other spanish class), then in 6th grade, we all only had one class together but hung out during lunch. More into the year, they started bringing their new friends to the table we sat at (they were long table rows) while I never had any new friends so while at the table my friends were surrunded by their new friends and I wasnt able to be near them as much. \n\n Then suddenly I had a period where I \\*just didnt care\\* about anything. My mom was working more so I didnt see her much at home, my sister moved out (my other sister, the oldest moved out when i was in elementary) which took a huge toll on me since she was a huge support, my cousin ( in her 20s and her daughter about 6 at the time) were living in my room as well (they left before my sister did, it wasnt a long period of time), I didnt have my friends like i orignally thought, i had joined online platforms as an escape as well as reading a lot more both online and offline, I met a girl who became my online friend/ later lover but we argued constantly, she intoduced me to like 3 other people who quickly came and went with arguments, through her I found out i wasnt completely straight, and soon also found out that my parents wouldnt be supportive and ive just now started suspecting one of my sisters isnt and that she probably thinks im just going through a phase , I also joined online chats and joined a fan group i am currently on even though it is pretty dead right now, I didnt care how i dressed or much about hygiene, I joined two after school clubs to not have to go home right after school along with the fact that the school librarian was really sweet and nice to me when i needed it the most. Over all ended up distancing myself from my friends. So sort of a period of depression aswell\n\nThen sometime during mid 6th, I met my current best friend (?), N, and stopped overall hanging out with my past friends (i dont remember if i hung out with N during lunch, I think I was just reading instead) During 7th, I didnt have a class with any of my past friends, I had two with N, and had some acquaintance since we werent really friends, I just sat with them during some classes. Then Covid happened. Ill admit, I had no motivation, and was online most of the time, just reading or being in chatrooms. During summer/ 8th I started talking to N more, and we easily became bestfriends, we both talked to each other everyday and vented our problems and were there for each other, then reccently, Ive started to think that i might have developed feelings for her that im very sure she will never return, and even if she did, Im not sure if I would want to have an official relationship since my last one ended badly. \n\nThen we started highschool \n\nI feel like its going down hill\n\nI only have one class with N on W days and two on B days, we can only sit next to each other in bio which is a class we have on both W and B days. During lunch on the first day, we couldnt find eachother and an acquaintance/sort of friend found me so i ate with her and her friends for the first day. On the second we found each other. (a bit more of the lunch topic later)\n\n I made a friend during gym on the first day, but I think its one sided. she (K) loves to talk and while im completely fine with that, whenever I try to talk, she doesnt always acknowledge me/engage like i do with her, which upsets me, but I cant really back out since I dont know anyone else in the class and think it would be awkward if i just ignore her. \n\nThen I was paired up with D for one class, we were okay with each other as we also knew eachother from elementary and sat next to eachother for that class. Later that day or the next, Im not sure, she joins me and N for lunch, specifically N as she didnt want to be alone for lunch. Then later that week (or the next school week, my memory is terrible) E, joins us (E is also Ls' cousin) for lunch, because of N as well. D and I dont talk to eachother much during class if at all. Me and E sometimes talk, and me and N dont talk much during lunch because she is usually wrapped up in a conversation with D. Im staring to feel left out. \n\nWhich brings me to me starting to believe that N is only friends with me currently out of pity/familiarity because of a few things\nI have a lot of,, weird(?) interests, I like collecting rocks and big sticks, plushies, key chains, pins, patches, anything shiny i find on the ground, little gnome statues, I like owls (she finds them creepy), during bio we took apart owl pellets and I was excited for it because we were also told we could keep any bones we find, I like 'odd' fandoms like Camp Camp, South Park, Homestuck, occasionally horror movies and the most 'normal' fandoms im in are The Owl House and She-ra, all of which I infodump/talk alot about randomly, even though she usually has no idea what im talking about, Which while it sounds like im just r/ notlikeothergirls im mostly listing stuff that- whenever we talk- i feel like she thinks im weird because of them (obviously not all of them) mostly the bones part.\n\n I also think another reason shes friends with me out of pity is because im not the best socially. Its hard for me to make friends, especially with the people in my 'academy' because none of them have the same/similar intrest as me and I dont interact with anyone outside of the 'academy' (other then my gym class) and usually keep to myself. \n\nD and E are more so friends with N rather then me so i dont fully consider them my friends. N is more social and easily has friends around, she knows that K is the only person outside of her that I talk to. \n\nand one most last thing as i went way off topic, \n\nas my first sentence stated, \n\nI messaged G because our school got a shooter threat eariler today and wanted to make sure she knew, after that, she asked if ive talked to L lately, I said i havent and turns out that L moved. L moved 6 months ago and I didnt know at all. G also mentioned that L asked her to be their 'dama' for Ls' quince, I also found out that G visted L yesterday. \n\nIt hurts for some reason because I know im the one who distanced myself, I know i should have kept contact, but i also know that L didnt message me either.  And now, G is still in Ls' life while im not, im not jealous, just hurt even though i know i shouldnt and that its selfish of me to be. I guess its just everything feels like its crashing down, like my cycle of distancing myself to not get hurt,that the cycle of feeling replaced by new people is happening again and im once again losing a friend that ive planned my life with. and i know that thats just what life is, and moving on is a part of it but i dont feel like i can do it again. and ive started thinking about talking to my ex (the one mentioned) again because i want someone like them to talk to, because i feel like they would definitely understand me better then anyone else but i feel like thats just so unfair to them, and either ways ive lost my method of communication with them last week because i got locked out of the account i used to talk to them. \n\n\nanyways, this is a long off topic rant/vent/semi self loath post that i wanted to get off my chest, thanks so much to those who took time to read this if at all."

Most of their riffs are quite simple (at least on sheet,playing some of them can be tricky),but they create a mood for the song. Lyrics only add to established atmosphere. And I think Favourite Worst Nightmare shows all the colors their songs can have and does it amazingly. All the raw energy on faster is still present here in spades,but it has this new,darker feel to it. Slow songs have that new sense of maturity and introspection that wasn't really present before.\n\nAlso,I think the tracklist is extremely strong. The only song I can admit is a bit weak is The Bad Thing,but even that one grew on me a lot. At its highest, it has some of the best songs they ever released-Brianstorm,Teddy Picker,Only Ones Who Know,Do Me A Favour,Old Yellow Bricks and of course 505.\n\nHumbug would expand on the atmospherics this album introduced,but it won't have the same energy and attitude that FWN has. Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not has more of youthful drive and charisma,but lacks that sense of maturation that FWN showed. So FWN remains for me that sweet spot,where they have done everything right.",

I am biased here,because FMB is my favourite Gizz album,but for me it had a lot more energy overall than KG has. I will be fair and say that it was probably their intent,but it still slightly disappointed.\n\nBut let not judge an album just for its ties to a fantastic album,is it good on its own? Yes,I will say it's great. First half is more subdued and relaxed (I get huge Paper Mache Dream Balloon vibe from it),but the songs grow on you pretty easily. Second half is a star of the show though. Run from Ontology to The Hungry Wolf Of Fate is spectacular and shows different modes of the band,while connecting in an unexpectedly seamless way. \n\nOverall,I would say that it is a worthy Part 2 and a great album on its own.

Even more on that, he was willing to let Sirius die despite knowing he was innocent, and vindictively ruined Remus's career by outing him as a werewolf. I also think it was more of a two-sided rivalry rather than just bullying on James's part, but even if it was just bullying, Snape has negatively impacted the lives of many because of bullying he was subjected to at 15.",

(And I won't have to)  \nThis kind of test is unavailable anywhere near me in the UK and I am confused where to book \"day 2 only\" by post and also confused how does it work once you booked it (Where do I send it to? Which site do I order it from?)  \n2. One pharmacy near me offers \"Fit to fly PCR swab test\". You can book it on any day you wish. I thought of choosing this and booking it on my day two to get the booking number to my Passenger Form, but I wonder if it's the right test to choose? I mean a lot of websites state it's perfect when you fly out of the UK and I'm going to arrive, hence confusion.   \n\n\nI was wondering what you did in this situation and which one did you choose?  \nAlso, wondered if anyone knows if it's illegal to choose the \"fit to fly\" one in my case? (it would be easier to do that's why i'm asking)  \nThanks for all the info in advance!"

                "body": "I'll probably get downvoted but I don't really care I just wanted to express how much I think this adaptation is badly done.  \n\n\nEvery single writing choice was bad. I dare you to objectively says this Joel and that Ellie are faithful to their game counterparts. (or Billy and Tess or anyone I guess)  \nIt's simply a lie to say it's the case, the changes are simply too important (and smh stupid imo) and in total contradiction with the original characters. And I shouldn't even have to say this but obviously I have nothing agaisnt the two actors, I did not know them before the adaptation and I even think they're good actors in this serie I just think their characters were badly written.\n\n  \nThe first obvious change(but note that those changes are just the most evident ones, but it's always like this at a different levels) is when Ellie stab the FEDRA soldier because he was gonna discover she's \"infected\".   \nWhy ?  \nIt changes a lot about Ellie's but also Joel's character. First, the fact that Ellie does not apologize is a catalyst to show how this Ellie is not as innocent as the one from the game actually was. Ellie from the game is kinda mature for her age but she's still a kid and a nice one too. She's about to throw up when she kills for the first time to save Joel, and it's so hard for her that it's one of the rare times she's \"angry\" at Joel for his reaction.  \nThe Ellie of the HBO show is just not the Ellie from the game, except being vulgar I don't see any similarities.  \nNow on Joel's side, the fact that they made it a PTSD moment is such a weird choice too. First on a strictly writting choice, it's very ponderous that early. But on a TLOU perspective it's just ridiculous to turn a very simple Joel thing(and Tess) into a sentimental one. During those 3 episodes I never had the feeling Joel was an hardened survivor.   \nTbh, I hope I'm wrong but the simple fact that he seems to still being on good terms with Tommy scares me for the rest of the serie. I'm getting the feeling that Joel will not be a \"bad person\" in this serie.   \n\n\nAnother change is Ellie and Joel's reaction when Tess dies. In the game Ellie tries several times to apologizes and in the serie she's like \"I don't give a fkc, it was your fault\".  \nEven Joel's reaction is so OOC.   \n\n\nAnd for episode 3 I just have one thing to say : I don't understand Bill's last message to Joel, cause it seems to me that it's in total contradiction with the Joel(and his evolution) during the game. He would always be against suicide. Like he said \" **...No Matter What, You Keep Finding Something To Fight For.**\"  \n\n\nAnyway, this is getting way too long for nothing. I swear to god, I can't comprenhend how anyone can seriously think Joel and Ellie are well done in this serie. And I wanted to rant, you can downvote me or answer, give your opinion it can be interesting to have some replies."

                "body": "Hello Everyone! I am very new to PC Building, I literally have no idea where to start at all lol. I was considering getting an ASUS Zephyrus m16 gaming laptop, but one of my friends told me that because of its battery issues and heating, it would be a bad pick for me going into college, and instead should get a separate laptop for school, and a separate gaming pc for home and more intensive tasks, like gaming, video editing, and 3d software. I would like your insights on what I should do, please! Also, regardless of whether or not I'm going to go with a gaming laptop or pc, I plan on buying 2 monitors and making a double monitor setup, so any suggestions for monitors would be great!\n\n1. \\>\\*\\*What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.\\*\\*\n2. I will mostly be playing Valorant, Overwatch 2, Minecraft, Elden Ring, and any other possible triple-A that might pique my interest in the future (Hogwarts Legacy). I am just about to graduate high school and want to go into computer science, so something that can help with that would be nice. I'd also like to learn stuff having to do with 3d software with some video editing on the side as well. I might stream occasionally\n3. \\>\\*\\*What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?\\*\\*\n4. Somewhere around $2000, excluding costs for monitors, a desk, keyboard, mouse, etc.\n5. \\>\\*\\*When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.\\*\\*\n6. I plan on building it near black Friday so that I can get any possible deals possible\n7. \\>\\*\\*What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\\\\)\\*\\*\n8. Literally everything, however stuff like monitors, keyboards, the mouse, Soundsystem, and a headset I can buy at a later time\n9. \\>\\*\\*Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?\\*\\*\n10. NJ. I do have access to a microcenter\n11. \\>\\*\\*If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.\\*\\*\n12. Nothing\n13. \\>\\*\\*Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?\\*\\*\n14. Maybe sometime down the line, im not sure\n15. \\>\\*\\*Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)\\*\\*\n16. I need this pc to be able to work on wifi. I would also like it to run intel, however, I can do amd if it suits me better. I would also like an SSD with a lot of storage. I have no idea what CUDA is, but from a quick google search, it seems nice. Keep in mind that I want to go into computer science and programming, so anything that can help with that would be good. I might also go into physics, so something that can help me make a good physics engine would also be sweet\n17. \\>\\*\\*Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?\\*\\*\n18. I don't really mind, I'm willing to cut costs on aesthetics if it means the actual pc itself is good\n19. \\>\\*\\*Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?\\*\\*\n20. I would need one, but i have no preference\n21. \\>\\*\\*Extra info or particulars:\\*\\*\n22. I do own a ps5, idk if its relevant but i plan on using both if i happen to get a pc (PlayStation exclusives). I would also be using this pc on wifi, so a pc with wifi support would be neaded!"

I've been looking everywhere yet I cant find a single logical reason why I should keep on living. I've attempted multiple times before, one of which was this past mother's day (I know call me a jerk but it was sort of a revenge) and still havent died. I'm not grateful I didnt die, looking back i wish i had. Every single reason I've come up with for living I've thought up of a greater counterargument as to why I should kill myself. I honestly cant take this anymore and want it to end but I'm so pathetic I cant even kill myself correctly. All I'm asking for is one logical reason that I dont have a counterargument for, that's all yet I cant find it anywhere so the logical answer is for me to just end myself."

It's ok, life happens and things that need to get taken care of sometimes fall by the wayside. What you should focus on is getting your home back to a safe baseline. Safe meaning, it is a physically safe space for you to be in, no tripping hazards or biohazards or anything. Nothing that would hurt you. You deserve to have a safe space. And it can take however long you need it to take to get there. I would recommend the book How to Keep House by Downing by KC Davis. It's a favorite around cleaning subs. It's a gentle approach to cleaning and keeping house. I love the way it breaks down cleaning though. It goes as follows\n\n1. clear any trash\n2. gather your dishes and place them where you wash them; do not wash the dishes (they can be tackled at a later time)\n3. gather your laundry and place it next to the washer (but again do not do the laundry)\n4. pick one corner or section of the room and start to put into place the items from around that corner; move to the next corner or section until you're done\n5. finally, put away the items that are now out of place\n\nMaybe focus on the first 2 steps for a while. Just take it easy and get that trash out. Get the dishes out. Make sure those biohazards are gone! That's the baseline of getting your home safe again. Then focus on laundry and getting one corner done. Once you get that done, REVEL IN IT! YOU HAVE DONE A CORNER! Show us before and after pics if you feel like it, we love to see them! Work in 20/10's if you need to. Never overwhelm yourself. And don't judge yourself by your old \"neat freak\" habits. Just get it to a safe baseline for now. You deserve that for yourself. It seems like a lot, but we believe in you! You absolutely 100% got this, OP! We are cheering you on!",

I'm just now learning to take things into my own hands and just do. I just had my first cleansing shower the other day and man did it up my mood! Wow! After being raised in a strict Christian household, I am just now really coming to terms with the fact that I am probably an agnostic theist after thinking there for a bit that I was leaning on the more atheist side. I still am figuring out what I believe though. I recently discovered Iris, Goddess of Rainbows (!) and am thinking of dedicating my altar to her! I was already going to have a rainbow alter anyway, but this is just too perfect.\n\nI love reading, so I have quite the library of witchy books. Have I read them all? No. But am I actively acquiring more to further my knowledge? Yes. Right now, I practice under the idea of placebo witchcraft, though I am open to the idea of it becoming more. I'm more interested in spells to work on myself and my own wellbeing. I haven't decided on a path yet, though I love the moon and her cycles and I do seem to have an interest in crystals, astrology, and green witchcraft. I love celebrating the Sabbats too! I'm so excited for Ostara, kicking off my favorite season of the year when everything is bright green and lovely.\n\nI'm open to the idea of email and instant messaging and maybe snail mail, maybe. I have to type everything out first and it takes a while for me to convert all that into writing. I have been known to disappear for a month or two when my depression really gets me, but I always come back. I just like to put that warning in there. I try my best not to ghost people. I have a pinned post on my profile where you can learn a little bit about me more in general. Please message if you think we would be a good fit! I love the idea of having some witchy friends to discuss things with!"

I'm a (nearly) 28-year-old from Georiga, soon to be Alabama! So, if you're interested in the southern US, hey y'all. I am really worldly and love learning about new countries and their customs and cultures. It fascinates me. So I am welcome to people from around the globe!\n\nA few things about me, hmmm...\n\nI'm very crafty. I love arts and crafts so much. I don't do much \"DIY\" stuff per se, but I paint and I do origami and I crochet. I love to talk about what I am making and sometimes when I send packages to my current penpals, I'll include some art. Right now I am making a bee out of the biggest yarn I could find. He's going to be very lorge\u2122.\n\nI'm also an avid reader. I mostly listen to audiobooks because they let my ADHD brain focus on two things at once, for example, dishes and listening. (Did I mention I am neurodivergent? Totally am) I love YA contemporary and chick-lit. I would say I like adult romance books too, but the s\\*x scenes! Bleh, no thank you! (I'm also on the ace spectrum) But I am always up for recommendations. That, and I am always ready to vouch for the same 5 books over and over again because I totally read them over and over again.\n\nI'm also a lover of all things kawaii and rainbows. I plan on having a rainbow craft room when I move. I've always had a huge interest in Japan though, even went once. I read manga every now and again. Mostly magical girl stuff at the moment. Reading Sailor Moon for the first time and Tokyo Mew Mew for the second. I want to read A Man and His Cat next, I have heard so many good things about it. I'm also working on watching all of Maison Ikkoku though I might have to switch over to Uruesi Yatsura since they are making another adaption of it due out this year.\n\nI'm mainly looking for email penpals because it's so much easier for me to email than to write. If I write I have to type out what I am saying first and then write it all down, which can take days because I like to send long letters. But I do like to exchange little packages and cards sometimes if you're in the US. I'm still experimenting with sending cards and things internationally.\n\nIn the past few months, I have been caught up in life, so I might go missing for a month or two, but I will always come back.\n\nI'm looking for anyone who is willing to let me learn more about them and wishes to continue mailing back and forth for years to come! Preferably 22+, unless you need a motherly figure. I play the role of advise giver very well, but I can be mean about it at times. Still working on that. Please feel free to comment or DM if interested!"

                "body": "I think your math wiz needs to do a little research. The math he is thinking of is a modern convention. He should do research on what was actually medieval mathematics. A quote, to give you a general idea:\n\n>Medieval mathematics was on the whole far removed from anything that we think of as mathematics today. Indeed to study this period at all you need to be prepared to enter a world whose preconceptions, political, religious, or mathematical, were very different from our own. There are texts that are recognisably devoted to arithmetic, geometry, or occasionally algebra, but most of the writings that were later described as 'mathematical' were concerned with astrology and astronomy (the distinction between the two was often blurred). Others border on philosophy, natural philosophy (or early science), and even theology. https://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/students/research-guide/medieval-early-modern-mathematics\n\nNow, your math wiz friend could be a true savant, maybe the \u201cNewton\u201d of his day. But then maybe his \u201cspells\u201d should reflect Newtonian mathematics. \n\nThat said, I would say that the hard math should be \u201cin the book.\u201d That your math wizard\u2019s spell book is a series of bizarre equations and short-hand that to a modern eye would look like physics or quantum mechanics, and that your math wizard has learned to deconstruct verbal components to the frequency, instead of chanting a verse, he can hum a note, that he has been able to boil down material components to their alchemical roots (meaning his material components would be, say small vials of carbon, sulfur, etc in discrete proportions to replicate the source - all of this hand-waved by his component pouch, and that the spells are a result of his formulas combining the distilled essences of the verbal, somatic and/or material aspects. I would also give him a skill in alchemy, because alchemy was part and parcel of medieval mathiness. Maybe create a custom background, because I can certainly see skills in astrology/astronomy. alchemist kit and religion. You could also play with the idea that maybe he has a set of crystal Euclidean solids - which you can actually buy on Amazon, and would give your math wizard physical props. \n\nYour math wizard should remember that specializations as we know it didn\u2019t exist. Most \u201cmathematicians\u201d were polymaths and dabbled in many divers fields. I would also give him a pass at RPing, basically going with a more passive approach: \u201cMy wizard grabs a pinch of (distillate of spiderweb, or whatever alchemical whatnots you choose), and humming a low frequency, traces a geometric pattern, and I cast Web!\u201d The mathematic RP, so to speak, would be in downtime activities: \u201cAs the group is resting, you can hear math wizard mumble to himself \u2018curious, if I substitute the coefficient here, then this should result in a more effective output (meaning \u201cI just learned to upcast a spell\u201d). You could also have him role play the math bits when he learns new spells. Also, given that a lot of what the Western would would come to understand was math, came from the East, so you math wizard could have learned his unique spell casting from far away. Here\u2019s a link to medieval islamic mathematics for inspiration https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world\n\nThere\u2019s a lot *you* could do with a Newtonian math wizard: unique spins on existing magic items, new ways to describe spell effects. An entire role play system for how your math wizard distills his material components, maybe based on alchemy: https://blog.prepscholar.com/alchemy-symbols\n\nI guess my tl;dnr is that trying to play 21st century math nerd wizard in what is ultimately a fantasy setting seems to be causing issues for all parties, but by embracing \u201cperiod\u201d mathematics, and leaning into all the diversity it offers, your math wizard, you and the rest of the table now have a lot of very interesting happenings.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with this article: Newton, the Last Magician. https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/januaryfebruary/feature/newton-the-last-magician",

                "body": "So, our house was built in 1919, long before the rest of the development was a development. It\u2019s not a lovely house, fairly small and the last time it had seen any home improvements was in the 90s. \n\nI admit, we were not responsible homeowners, and now pay the price. Many years ago, we had a large limb fall on the house, which caused major water damage. We didn\u2019t discover the extent until we had the siding redone two years ago, where the entire wall, 2 storeys, had to be reframed (that was a $7K addition to the cost of the siding). \n\nA lot of this water damage ended up impacting the kitchen, so I knew that at some point, when we were looking at a kitchen remodel - it wasn\u2019t going to be a remodel, it was going to have to be bringing it to the frame and repairing any outstanding damage. So we knew any kitchen remodel would have a major additional cost (so a 10K kitchen may be 30K). Now, we have a bit of equity in our house, having bought it for $229 back in 2000 and never touching the equity. But we wanted to get a ballpark of what to aim for, because we have other projects we have to do AND I don\u2019t want to be in the same shoes as my father was - having a 300K mortgage at 70 years old (which is how my mother lost the house when my father died). I\u2019m 56. \n\nA friend of mine recommended Home Depot, and when we went to their kitchen design group, we *told* them this was not going to be a simple renovation. They said they\u2019d send their recommended contractor out, have him give us some ballparks so we could figure out the financing.\n\nThe guy shows up Friday and immediately complains about our driveway. I apologize for it (the driveway got washed out a few years ago and we need to have it redone) but no matter what, it is a long, narrow, curving driveway as our \u215b acre property is long and narrow, with the house set very far back and the cesspool is in the front. So the guy complains he can\u2019t get his truck up the driveway, even if it were a decent driveway. He couldn\u2019t get the dumpster up. Now, I heard the same thing from the folks we contracted for the siding, but their sub contractors managed just fine, just using smaller trucks. \n\nThe contractor then heads into the kitchen and starts to ask what I\u2019m looking for. Yells at me for not already having a budget. Then stops cold and completely loses his shit about the floor, the sloping, the old water damage. He never lets me get a word in edgewise to let him know about the old water damage, or about the repair to the wall that was already done. He drew a square and took some quick measurements, went into my basement, then told me Home Depot won\u2019t take this job and I need to find a private contractor then left. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong - I understand the takeaways. It is likely the entire kitchen needs to be demolished and rebuilt, with the floor reframed and a new sub floor put in. And there is possible foundation issues. I was expecting something close to that given all the water damage we, as idiotic homeowners, didn\u2019t address properly and now pay the price. But the guys who did the siding, didn\u2019t freak out. They just showed us the damage and quoted us 7K to fix it (then went above and beyond to refinish the closets along the wall AND re-level my door). \n\nThe problem is - I still *need* some kind of napkin math estimate and the contractor left me with nothing. So now I don\u2019t know what my next move is. I still don\u2019t know what a worst case would be for a kitchen of my size. I don\u2019t know what a reasonable amount of equity to get out of the house. My husband was thinking to take all the equity, pay off the windows, doors and siding and use the rest for the kitchen, then the leftovers for the driveway and fireplace. \n\nI\u2019m waiting to hear back from Home Depot. I\u2019m also thinking of reaching out to the guys who did the siding and reframed our wall, because they already saw the state of the kitchen (and didn\u2019t freak out). I only went with Home Depot because I can\u2019t see in my head, so I can\u2019t envision how I want the kitchen to look and need a professional to layout a decent kitchen with the space I have available. \n\nSo what do I do next? How can I get an estimate to secure a budget if I\u2019m supposed to have a budget? When we did the siding and the windows, the company we used told us the cost, then helped us secure the financing. It looked like Home Depot was going along the same path, but now...I just don\u2019t know what my next steps are, but something HAS to be done. The dish washer leaks, so the sub floor is severely compromised. We must get the kitchen done and a project of this magnitude is way out of my wheelhouse."

All the replacements we found were either too long or too short for our nipple, which leaves us in the unenviable position of trying to jury-rig a solution by making a 4\u201d spout connect to a 3 \u00be\u201d nipple.\n\nIs there any way to find a \u201clegacy\u201d replacement for this size spout, or a way to lengthen the nipple to fit? The tub area is this acrylic \u201cbath fitter\u201d installation, which would make replacing the nipple a far more complicated job than we hope for at this time, and we\u2019re trying to avoid having to cut the nipple down to accommodate a shorter spout - both efforts being a bit out of our wheelhouse.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be most welcome.\n\nEdit: I contacted Delta. They do not support products from 1996, but they pointed me to an adapter and a replacement part, both really inexpensive.\n\nHowever, my husband ended up going to Home Depot and picked up a Delco replacement based on u/upstateduck\u2019s comment that a standard spout should work, and it did. My husband spent more time preparing to replace the faucet than in actually installing the replacement, which simply screwed on.\n\nI\u2019m looping back on this in case there are other people who have a similar issue. It looks like the generic replacement spout will work on a slightly smaller nipple, as long as the pipe\u2019s diameters match."

My parents won't teach me to drive or let me take driving lessons, yet constantly complain about having to take me to and from church for activities. I'm not allowed to go out with school friends, run errands, or go out on my own, with the pretext being that there are maniacs out there who want to do bad things to me. It's gotten to the point that when I managed to persuade them to bike to the corner store the other day, I was REALLY anxious and paranoid about being on my own. \n\nI also have ADHD and they have done nothing to help me with it, despite my efforts trying to find a psychiatrist. My grades are tanking because of it, and it's been affecting me to the point that I forget to eat some days. It's a MASSIVE problem in our house and no matter how many times I've brought it up with them they STILL refuse to get me help. What makes me angry is that I know I have the capacity to do great in school. I'm fairly smart and all my teachers say that I need to try harder in my classes, but even though I try my hardest I still can't do well. \n\n I'm almost an adult, for crying out loud, I'm sick of being babied, being viewed as a freak by my peers because my mother stayed the whole time for a band rehearsal, I'm tired of my parents breathing down my neck my every waking moment, and every time I bring this topic up with them they proceed to shift the blame on me, make empty promises of how things are going to change around here, and proceed to do nothing. \n\nI turn 18 in November and it's rapidly approaching. I never got to live out \"The best years of my life\" thanks to their helicopter parenting and COVID. I'm scared when I have to go out into the real world."

I'm not sure how it's supposed to feel if I do this right. I'm also not sure how to work with it, like if it leaks or how to open it without the overwhelm. If anyone has any resources or experience with it, that'd be great. Thanks in advance :)"

                "body": "Hello all,\n\nIt's been awhile. I'm doing better since last I posted. It wasn't pretty for most of the time, and involved lots of isolation and crying. Crying in my car, on my breaks at work, at odd hours of the night, at social events...\n\nNot that it was all bad. I moved to a smaller, more affordable apartment, and have been enjoying making it a place I can call home. I have plans for my career and future. I switched doctors, and found one who takes my health issues seriously, and is helping me get better. I joined an online role-playing group, have been enjoying my adventures with them, and this past week I laughed like I haven't laughed in a long time and I didn't feel bad about it. I've also been getting better at recognizing unhealthy behavior in other people, and having better boundaries myself, but it's not perfect, as you'll see.\n\nSo here's my problem. I finally went NC with my Nex after much deliberation and several attempts to try to be friends with him. But this also meant changing things with our mutual friends, who had already semi-exiled me from group events. I was allowed at things like movies, where it was dark, he and I could be far apart, and potentially there'd be no drama. It was embarrassing and heartbreaking and felt a lot like how my Nex had treated me, making me out to be the problem and putting the burden on me to cope with it. Some of them would meet up with me, or message me, just not as part of the group, and certainly not to my Nex's knowledge. And that felt kind of wrong, like I'm some weird mistress. Even though they've all expressed some dislike or disinterest in hanging out with him, he's the one that gets to see them regularly.\n\nThey also didn't treat me too kindly when I was going through hard times, especially with the divorce. It fell into two camps. I either wasn't allowed to talk about the divorce or what I was going through at all, or I could talk about it somewhat but I still had zero support. They didn't want to seem like they had taken my side, or had contributed to the divorce in any way, since I was the one that filed. \n\nAnd they still don't seem kind. I've spent a lot of time and energy worrying about what kind of friend I am, and what to talk to them about, and what activities we can do together, and have lately seen some 'progress' with these friendships when I don't speak of my past or of certain troubles at all, and keep things light and superficial, and cater to them. Or I keep topics relatable, like stress with work or money. Yet in the past, they've picked fights over me not being open enough, or not sharing troubling things with them. And I've picked fights with them for not actually being there for me, and then it gets twisted into how I don't think they're good enough. \n\nAnd recently, I was told to 'not be crazy' when rekindling a friendship with another member of the mutual friend group, meaning to not confront that person on why they haven't really spoken to me during this whole mess. I ended up saying why I hadn't really spoken to them instead because I felt something needed to be said about it. It was acknowledged, but they quickly changed subjects afterwards.\n\nI'm quite confused on the whole thing. For now I've put more distance between me and all of them while I try and sort things out. I figured posting on here wouldn't hurt either. My Nex drilled it into my head that I was toxic, that I ruined his friendships with these friends, that I'm the problem. I've apologized profusely in the past to mutual friends for this, but they said I wasn't toxic. They seem to want to be friends with me, but something seems off. I don't know what sort of dynamic they really have with my Nex, but it seems weird. Maybe they want to get back to some sense of 'normal', but I don't think sweeping it under the rug is going to work. \n\nAny thoughts?"

I had thought I'd moved past things on my own (reality: just bottled it up), that I didn't need any other support (reality: I do), and that even if I did post no one would take me seriously (haven't tried yet, so...).\n\nI'll probably post more details about my background at later times. I know two of my N's use reddit, so I'm using a shiny new account specifically to post for this kind of stuff. \n\nFor this post though, I'll say that I have made a lot of major life changes in the past year, including: getting a divorce, changing jobs, moving, going NC or VLC with N's, and living on my own for the first time in my life. I've also lost friends due to the divorce, had a loved one pass away very recently, and had health and financial issues. \n\nSome days, it seems hard just to breathe, let alone do the things I want to do or know it'd be good for me to do, like volunteer at an animal shelter, find a therapist, go to the gym, join a tabletop RPG, get back in touch with the creative side of me, or date someone new. When it comes to these things, my mind immediately starts in with how I'm not capable or deserving. I sabotage myself, get so anxious I get sick, or spiral downward. I have very few people in my life that I trust now, and some of them don't really understand what I've been through. Heck, I'm still trying to understand what I've been through, why I feel like I don't know who I am, the role I played in all of this, what I could've done differently. I've read Pete Walker's books, Anne Katherine's 'Boundaries', some of Bancroft's 'Why does he do that?' and Vanderkolk's 'The body keeps the score', looked at DBT and IFS therapy manuals on my own. I've read posts that I can identify with, ones that talk of abuse and neglect.  \n\nBut I feel stuck now. I've read plenty, been in my own head plenty, but not reached out to those who might understand. So, I'm hoping someone reads my post, and can give some encouragement or advice. "

                "body": "Education, as i know it, is when people learn various things.\n\nThose things can range in subjects such as english, mathematics, botany, etc.\n\nHowever, as of late, I've lost faith in that concept. Yes, it's good to be educated. Yes, it's good to be knowledgeable of various topics.\n\nSadly, nothing lasts forever. I'm at my early 20's now and I've spent a sizable chunk of my life going to school. However, at this point, i have pretty much forgotten most of things taught to me, with the basic parts of the subjects that i learned being the exception.\n\nI can read, i can write, i can do calculations with the aid of a calculator. Any subject from school that i didn't apply to my daily life had already been long erased from my memories. I don't remember advanced geometry, i don't know what I've been taught in botany, and i certainly can't recall anything in geography. \n\nAt this point, i ponder. Is this truly the education that all youth has to undergo to? Is this way of acquiring knowledge effective? Is this education truly worth the time, effort, and money spent?\n\nI think not. \n\nI'm already at college, i wanted to pursue the arts. I thought that i would finally be able to focus on what i really wanted, on what i'm really interested in. I thought i can finally be able to happily invest my time where i think it matters most.\n\nI was, once again, wrong and utterly disappointed.\n\nThere was no difference between college and the rest of the grades. In the end, even though you are enrolled for what you signed up for, you still have no choice but to take subjects that have little to no relevance to what course you chose. This is especially vexing for me because i struggle to keep tabs on multiple subjects.\n\nAs of writing this post, I've already flunked four subjects due to me not being able to pass the requirements on time. And for some reason, i do not feel uneasy. Rather, i feel as though i have long accepted failure. My schedule is tightly knit. Every week, all the subjects will be giving out a task for us to do, with the deadline being the same day next week.\n\n(ex. there's a task in history given out on Tuesday. The deadline will be on Tuesday next week)\n\nEvery once in a while, i think the teachers have forgotten that they're not the only subjects that we have to deal with. \n\nIn summary, i feel as though i barely have enough time for myself. I guess i do if i were to sabotage sleep (like i'm doing right now as i write this). It's as though the school that i've enrolled in expects me to live my life as a student, that the things that matter are the tasks given to us; anything else is unnecessary. \n\nUnfortunately, i don't think you can find an academic institute that does not do this. I think that each university, each academy, each institute are the same; every. single. one. \n\nWhich brings me back to the very question that drove me to write this at 1:00 AM in the morning: ***why are we doing this again?***"

I feel like i just got scammed to toil away much of my youth to unnecessary things that not only will i mostly forget in less than a month but will also stress me out in desperation of having expectations met. \n\n***I hate it.*** I also hate the fact that when it comes to school, i look forward *not to the classes*, but either to a natural disaster like a flood or an earthquake to cancel classes or to the teacher not showing up. That's honestly really sad. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I'm scared of the future because i don't know what lies ahead. ***Will i be rich? will be living on the streets as a homeless person? Will i finally be happy? Or will my life end abruptly?***\n\nI'm not looking forward to anything. I wish that everything would reach a peak where I'm at my happiest and stay like that forever as if time stood still. \n\nBut sadly, ***that's not how the world works, right?*** \n\n***TLDR; i was asked to imagine how i would see myself in the future, i can't.***"

One of those is a map (well two in fact, because I gonna need both a continental and a city map).  Technically I already made a continental map in PS which has a few important thing already (like continental shape, general location of mountain ridges, bodies of waters and even climate zone/biomes). It of course more functional for me than for the reader and also doesn't really look good (except the shorelines and the general shape.) And while I'm thinking about buying Wonderdraft (plus some assets because I don't really like the look of the mountains) I'm also thinking about the pay someone else do to a map for me (or just trying to improve the one what I made it previously). So before I decide I want to heat some other people who used this software for this purpose before."

Although I'm not sure how this works and what kind of map would I get for my money.\n\n\\- I can also buy some a program and do it in (like Wonderdraft).

This is new behavior, never had this from either cat before. Strange? Two days in a row, poops. WTF?\n\nAnd, one was about to vomit this morning. I assumed he had a hairball. Long-hairs, right? But it's been months without hairballs, since starting the anti-hairball dry food. \n\nThe house has two litter boxes, one large, one medium. Tonight was litter night, I empty them on the trash take-out schedule, twice a week. The medium one, which happens to be in the master bathroom (adjoining my bedroom), was absolutely FULL. This NEVER happens. Half full, sometimes. Never this packed. Well ok, no wonder they're pooping the floor during the night, when I keep them in the bedroom? But this nonsense started 2 days ago, so... it's been that full for 2 days? I literally emptied it 3 days ago. THIS NEVER HAPPENS.\n\nSo I was talking it over with my fiance, because now I'm worried. What are these cats eating? Where is it coming from? They don't have new food, nor more than the usual food. And it's not diarrhea, just the rabbit type poops. This is weird? Are they eating trash? \n\nHe suggested, perhaps one of them's been keeping a large volume of poop in their bellies, and it suddenly came out. Like, constipated. \n\nAnd then it clicked. The knock-off brand metamucil fiber junk. See, I've been having constipation issues, so I try to drink some every day. One night, I'm feeding the cats, then turn around to make myself some metamucil before sleeping. One cat, the perpetually hungry one (with the hairball problems) was under the kitchen table eating his food. He literally dashes in ASAP when he hears the food being poured. I'm stirring this cup, and I have a clumsy, and spill it. Some of it lands on the floor, and a little on the cat. Didn't seem like more than a drop on this cat. I figured, I'll mop it up later, and the cats can clean themselves.\n\nIt's orange flavored. Citrus and cats don't mix. So, I feel confident the cats won't lick it, until I get around to cleaning the floor, right?\n\nNext day, I want to mop, but it's clean already. Ok, someone in the house mopped it already. Cool, one less thing to do. \n\nAlso, the orange one has a sticky spot where the metamucil landed. Aww! But I figured, it'll come out eventually. Next day? No sticky spot. Cool, the cats took care of it.\n\nIt dawned on me that this perpetually hungry cat probably licked up the fiber, and unloaded all the poops he had been accumulating in his body. \n\nPS. Cat tax. [One](https://imgur.com/a/esbqecQ) and [Two](https://imgur.com/leHx1qa).\n\nTL;DR I spilled metamucil, the cats licked it up, and pooped everywhere."

                "body": "So, I've started telling my [Tales](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/quhsui/tales_from_tumblr_swtor_rp_1/) already, but today's Tale comes from Black Desert Online. This tale brought to you by: 1) [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/tfe8d8/is_it_only_my_impression_or_are_some_roleplaying/) and 2) Several topics coming up about polyamory, both IRL and on Reddit.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, BDO is a Korean MMORPG. After several years of pure grind, I found myself more interested in the idea of getting back into RP than more grinding. So, I migrated to the RP server. Fast forward a bit, and I was in a position of looking for an RP guild to join. This is one of many tales from that guild. We shall called the guild hmm... the Marauders. And their GM, MaraudBitch. \n\nFor the record, I made many mistakes while in this guild. There were like, a parade of Red Flags flying around, but I just sorta thought I was being judgmental or paranoid when I noticed them. Ha, no. \n\nLet's start with Day 1 of joining their guild Discord server, after joining their guild. MaraudBitch described the guild as \"like family to her.\" And, like its counterpart in job interviews, that's a warning sign. I *really* should have paid attention to that. Within moments of joining, some rando PMed me. We'll call her Liz. Liz described herself as \"mother's problem child\" and assured me that \"If anyone gives you a problem let me know! I will beat them up.\" Looking back, that's a [missing stair](https://geekfeminism.fandom.com/wiki/Missing_stair) warning, but hindsight is 20/20. (Like I said, communist parade up in here.) \n\nA little about Liz. Liz is one personality of a DID person. Liz is a trans-woman. She disowned her own family, and via RPing with MaraudBitch, as her daughter, came to think of herself as her IRL daughter. Adopted, so to speak. MaraudBitch encourages this. (Like I said, some colorguard flag-waving up in here.)\n\nMaraudBitch opened up about herself on the Discord. Turns out, she's a \"recovering\" borderline personality disordered person. Note the quotes. \"Recovering.\" Self-described empath, and very proud of it. Married, in an open relationship with her husband. I eventually discovered, one of her highest ranking guild officers (let's name him Sylvester) was also in a relationship with her. And, Syl's ALSO in an open relationship with his wife. And Syl was planning on moving cross-country to live in MaraudBitch's house. One big happy family, no?\n\nSo this is all background to the main plot of today's Tale. (Is the popcorn done popping yet? Go get it!) \n\nOk so, worth mentioning, in BDO there's a mechanism to declare war on other guilds. This is mainly used for territory disputes (a la \"Quit KSing my mobs!\"). Here and there, an RP guild will declare war on another RP guild for plot reasons, because RP. It's rare though, and usually staged well in advance. \n\nSo imagine my surprise when Marauders Discord was talking about a declaration war on some dinky guild I'd never heard of. Dafuq? So naturally, I ask what's going on. (With my witch's quarterstaff sharpened and ready to go fend off a territory dispute.) Oh, boy.\n\nRewind 3 years earlier. So MaraudBitch was in a much larger, more popular guild, let's call them WheelHouse. WheelHouse was known for its big, weekly RP parties that they publicly host in major cities. WheelHouse had an officer, Kevin. Kevin was a notorious ERP playboy. So MaraudBitch and Kevin were talking together about arranging an ERP between their characters. \n\nAccording to MaraudBitch, Kevin was insisting on sexually harassing her character, Emma. Emma was \"child-like\" and \"innocent\" and \"pure of heart,\" but definitely an adult, ok? (Totally.) IIRC, Emma was a shai, a race of fae similar to gnomes. (For [reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u64XCHPvgmM&ab_channel=EvianSinkarion).) She told him no repeatedly, so he retaliated by spreading rumors about her in the guild. Ultimately, she was kicked from the guild as a result of those rumors. Apparently, sometime later, he met his girlfriend via in-game ERP. \n\nFast-forward a bit. Because I was dubious, I investigated these claims. According to Kevin, and other members of the guild, that's not what happened. Kevin claims she came onto him. He found the character too child-like for his taste, and declined her advances. From many eye-witness accounts, she showed up at a public WheelHouse event, quite upset. Kevin and his girlfriend were in attendance, and upon seeing them together, she blew up at them both. Very obviously jealous. She got booted for causing drama.\n\nBut let's return to the declaration of war. Turns out, Kevin had a dispute with WheelHouse leadership over the direction of the RP plot, so he broke off with his GF and a small handful to create his own RP guild. Literally, the moment MaraudBitch caught wind, she wanted to declare war on his new guild. See, WheelHouse was too big to declare war on, so she waited until Kevin was vulnerable. MB had been planning this, apparently. She had a \"sister guild,\" run by her best friend, that was building up their characters for war-like purposes. The sister guild declared war, at MB's direction. Marauders were being tasked with keeping tabs on the movements of new guild, so whenever they emerge from safe zones, they can be ganged up on by the other guild, who we were coordinating with. Liz and I were tasked with attending WheelHouse events, pretending to be there for RP, but actually notifying the sister guild when they left the party. A task that Liz threw herself whole-heartedly into, gleefully \"protecting Mother.\" Meanwhile, publicly, Marauders deny all knowledge of any involvement.\n\nLike I said, it seemed dubious, so I held my tongue and started looking into this nonsense. Didn't help that they all referred to Kevin's GF as The Whore or The Slut or The Bitch. That was a good clue that something was *very* wrong. \n\nLong story short, I managed to pull both GMs into a chat with me, and convinced them to stand down and quit this nonsense. I forget how, I have deleted those receipts. IIRC, the most convincing argument was that no one's fooled about this ruse, and MB already has a reputation in the RP community, and if she wanted to increase recruitment and activity, she'd have to show good faith to the community. I think I threatened to leave, also, as this was drama I wanted no part of. (**I REALLY SHOULD HAVE**.) I think she knew that once I was gone, nothing stops me from telling the story.\n\nSo here I am, telling the story.  I hope you enjoyed this Tale."

                "body": "I might make a series. We'll see. \n\nToday's story is partly inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/qqwace/gay_men_and_misogyny/). Also, I responded to an ad about SWTOR RP, and while it's exciting, part of me hopes I don't run into any of the people involved in any of my Tales. (Filed under things that kept me from sleeping today: anxiety about running into Those People.) I don't even know how to flair this. Venting is definitely what it is, though.\n\nLong long ago, in Tumblr community far far away, I had an RP friend, we'll call them Alex. At the time of the story, Alex was still going by their AFAB name, married to a straight man, with kids, living in a rural town in the USA, and exploring gender-fluidity. Stuffed in the closet, basically, and peeking out. Last we spoke (this, also, years ago), Alex was divorced, undergoing hormone treatment, transitioning to male, living with his girlfriend, but still being/feeling feminine. TL;DR version, Alex is an efeminate bisexual trans-man.\n\nElsewhere in the community, was someone we'll name Ese. Ese was a gay man, but a misogynistic, transphobic one. Alex and Ese both tended to follow M/M pairings, especially porny/erotic ones, bonus points if there's character art. Alex had started RPing with a pair of very popular M/M RP writers (who did extensive character art, of the NSFW variety), so Alex's blog started getting reblogged by the more popular writers. Thus, Ese began to see Alex's content. \n\nAnd then shit began happening. (I suspect Ese was jealous that someone was getting RP that he wanted.) I had other people I followed, some of them LGBTQA, some of them porn addicts, people just kinda followed everyone else and you'd see the same reblog like, three billion times. So, I saw a reblog of Ese, like 3 billion times, vaguing about being \"tired of seeing white girls fetishizing gay men and writing them badly.\" Details were thrown in that anyone who knows Alex would be able to identify, so it's not exactly very vague. That passive-aggressive shade, tho. \n\nAlex was the kind of person that used RP to play-out their exploration of their sexuality. They'd RP a gay man as a way of trying it on. (The IC/OOC blurring was its own sin, and perhaps a Tale for another time. There's a reason we no longer talk!) They had an M/M RP going, with Alex' efeminate gay OC that was in a monogamous relationship with a more masculine gay OC. Angsty drama, suspicions of cheating, insecurity, jealousies, la dee da like that. \n\nA younger, more naive version of myself somehow got caught in the middle of Alex and Ese's nonsense. A la \"How dare you talk shit about my friend!\" I did manage to word it more civilly, but there's no way of calling out such nonsense without being somewhat aggressive in nature. (An older version of myself might have decided that there's no reasoning with fools, and being in the middle of crossfire just gets you fired upon.) Ese had his own ally, a straight (misogynistic and transphobic) man we'll call Kyle. Kyle was a very popular RPer, his writing was SO GOOD, according to many. So when Kyle jumped in, and everyone's seeing these things on their dashboard x4 (or 5 or 6, it became a whole dog-fight at one point), it sorta blew up.\n\nA little about Ese (as stated about himself and his beliefs during this debaucle):\n\n* He's a Real Gay Man\u2122, unlike those stereotypes\n* Real Men\u2122 are not monogamous.  \n* Monogamy is a thing invented by Straight Women\u2122. The only reason straight men are in monogamous relationships is because women trap them into them.\n* Real Gay Men\u2122 aren't restrained this way, so they are free to be as promiscuous as they want\n* Real Gay Man\u2122 are Manly Men, not girly boys. (Insert lament about how eVerYoNE stereotypes gay men as girly)\n* Real Men\u2122 don't display their emotions. \n* Jealousy is both an emotion that's displayed AND a reflection of monogamy, so Real Gay Men\u2122 would NEVAR do that\n* Straight Women are NOT ALLOWED to RP M/M because they write gay men like girls instead of REalIStiCallY\n\nOy.\n\nMeanwhile Kyle's position goes something like this:\n\n* Alex is a Straight Woman\u2122 pretending to be a trans-man in order to write fetishizing gay porn.\n* Real Men\u2122 aren't efeminate in any way. \n* Again, Real Men\u2122 don't display their emotions.\n* Alex's OC is obviously a Mary Sue self-insert (this is true enough)\n* The OC behaves like a straight woman, and is just a way for Alex to pose as a gay man to fetishize other gay men\n* And that's WRONG (or it would be, if true)\n* And policing *moral correctness* and *perfect RP etiquette* is the job of RP elitists like himself \n\nOy, pike off, would you guys?\n\nSo, many unfollows, blocks, and black-listings happened afterwards. The feeling's mutual, dudes. Good riddance, I'd say. And that should have been the end of it.\n\nNope.\n\nSo for years afterwards, Kyle would send friends of his to follow my blog and check up on me. And report anything/everything I post. They wouldn't follow me for my content, just to keep tabs. For YEARS afterwards, I'd get PMs or see a reblog or otherwise hear about them talking about me on their blog. And it was always characterizing me as homophobic, or a fetishizer. (Dude, I don't even care about M/M porn.) Or, you know, the random Anonymous comment in my inbox. Meanwhile, Alex torpedoed their blog, opened a new one, and made the RP partners swear secrecy about the new blog. (I can't imagine it was very secret for very long.)\n\nHere and there, new RP partners would approach me very cautiously, and eventually relate the Rumors they heard about me. *Oy, pike off, would you guys?* all over again. Oh! And \"Let's keep this RP in the PMs or on Discord or on Skype, I don't want it publicly known that I RP with you, because they'll unfriend me and drop RPs if they know I'm following and/or RPing with you.\" *Pike. The. Fuck. Off. Dudes.* \n\nOk, vent over. I hope you enjoyed this Tale."

Thanks. \n\nI feel like I've gotten over my childhood house that felt like home. I did that work and grieving last year, so thank goodness it isn't regurgitating now. Meanwhile, I've had abusive relationships in my adulthood, and have had to abandon places that I felt attached to. I don't really miss the people, so much as the place. \n\nStrangely, I've also found myself developing odd attachments to fictional places, like the houses for my characters in an MMORPG. I found myself feeling like those were *home*, moreso than the (honestly incredibly unsafe) places I was living in at the time. And since I don't play those games anymore, I miss them. Or, more accurately, the life in them. The pseudolife, anyway. \n\nI miss the apartment I had before. The one that contained my ex, but I don't miss him, or our life together. Just the place. And not the whole place: I never felt the bedroom belonged to me, or that nook where the ex set up his man-cave. But the living room, the window to the porch, the couch that pulled out as a bed, my desk set up there. There was a rectangle of space that belonged to me. I chose that decor. I remember the squirrel that used to visit me. That couch was my comfort place. \n\nI miss my \"house\" in that one game. A house in a small town overlooking the sea. I picked and arranged my furniture. There was a \"garden\" where I grew vegetables. I cooked there, and brewed potions. I had a job as a Magical Girl that killed monsters on a schedule of my own choosing, and death was not the end, just a mistake. The townsfolk treated me like a hero. It's nice to feel like I contributed to a sense of community, making the world a better place, and able to pursue hobbies as I saw fit. \n\nI ended up typing stuff into Google, and found this article: [Saying Goodbye to a Home](https://whatsyourgrief.com/saying-goodbye-to-a-home/). I found myself relating to the article (and crying), but also a little jealous of an author that has only had normal life experiences and a happy home to mourn. I almost need to mourn the idea of never having one of those, too.\n\nAnyway, since I'm not sleeping, I might as well share, yes?"

The enemies can include all the jerks and bullies who had hurted me so much in kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, high school. Those who had sexually harassed or bullied me gets a special place on it. Anybody else who had severely been toxic against me like making rape threats because of things like politics on Twitter, Tiktok, Reddit, Facebook, and so on. Not to mention Wiki which many editing users regularly hounding or ganging up on anyone due to small disputes. Any repeat trash talkers, spawnkillers, teamkillers, liars on roblox, amongus and COD which I feel too personal of are included.\n\nWith it, the bomb threats should be issued daily non-stop as long as the flights keep coming to Belarus. If it become too saturated enough then putting small-fire causing cola cans into the planes that only results in emergency turnarounds and landings should refresh them again. This will only stop when the airplane operators suspends flights to there because of safety reasons.\n\nThis would not absolutely stop Lukashenko from playing the dirty trick, but it will make it much harder. Sometimes we have to go an eye to an eye to make him blush. That Luka boy only respects force so I have to be Cruella enough to make him piss his pants if I have the will."

                "body": "I have an shower thought-y idea when I had a meal, where bomb threats if done many enough, can be used to disrupt any air travel to Minsk, chiefly from Middle Eastern nations, Belarus so that Lukashenko can no longer play that dirty trick of weaponizing migrants' plight to overwhelm EU's border like a gangster.\n\nIn this literally crazy and big plan, if I am in charge of that, I will issue all these bomb scare messages against any flight from Middle East to Belarus by way of hacked VOIP accounts, hacked social media accounts (like Twitter and Facebook), hacked websites, online free calling platforms and throwaway email accounts made with Tutanota, while behind so many layers of proxy networks up to TOR browser. \n\nIf VOIP and free phone calling websites were used, I will use some voice changer software obviously.\n\nOptionally I can put the name of my enemies as a 'signature' of these threats, or maybe use their name as usernames of throwaway email accounts. The enemies can include all the jerks and bullies who had hurted me so much in kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, high school. Those who had sexually harassed or bullied me gets a special place on it. Anybody else who had severely been toxic against me like making rape threats because of things like politics on Twitter, Tiktok, Reddit, Facebook, and so on. Not to mention Wiki which many editing users regularly hounding or ganging up on anyone due to small disputes. Any repeat trash talkers, spawnkillers, teamkillers, liars on roblox, amongus and COD which I feel too personal of are included.\n\nWith it, the bomb threats should be issued daily non-stop as long as the flights keep coming to Belarus. If it become too saturated enough then putting small-fire causing cola cans into the planes that only results in emergency turnarounds and landings should refresh them again. This will only stop when the airplane operators suspends flights to there because of safety reasons.\n\nThis would not absolutely stop Lukashenko from playing the dirty trick, but it will make it much harder. Sometimes we have to go an eye to an eye to make him blush. That Luka boy only respects force so I have to be Cruella enough to make him piss his pants if I have the will."

She is super caring and loves to play, loves everyone and so on.\n\nThe problem is that yesterday night I decided to give her a haircut, and I admit I wasn't the kindest while doing it. She didn't like it so I would grab her so she wouldn't leave, but I never hurt her or hit her in any ways, just a little of a struggle sometimes.\n\nThe thing is that after I let her go, he completely changed her behaviour. She  stayed in her bed all night, didn't want to play, not eating, etc. I figured she was a bit resentful of me and I was expecting her to come back to her old self this morning which didn't happen. She is still the same.\n\nThe thing is last night and this morning we had her regular walks, and she acts perfectly fine when we are outside. She pulls, wants to jump into other dogs and people, but as soon as we arrive home, she is back to her depressed state.\n\nSee I don't think she feels bad physically, because nothing really changed yesterday, only that I gave her the haircut...but I just have no idea of what to do regarding how she is acting. Should I worry that something serious is going on? Have you had any similar experiences in the past?\n\nThank you so much"

To make matters worse, the representative told me there was no way of knowing how old the oil was because they pour them from a large container. They will not refund me because it has been more than 60 days since my order. I feel like that is fair enough, but I had no idea the oils expired and I am yet to see that documented on their site.

At first I thought I wanted to move back to my home state, but after being here for the summer I have fully accepted that I will never be happy living here. I\u2019m currently on the east coast, but want to take a contract on the west coast for a year and then hopefully go perm. I worked for Advanced Travel Therapy for YEARS, but once they were bought by AMN, I have seen nothing but negative changes and will never work for them again. \n\nSo I\u2019d love to hear from current or past travelers! What companies have you had positive experiences with? What made the company good to work for? Were the contracts fair? How were the benefits? Was there opportunity to go perm? Etc etc. Any information you\u2019re willing to share is much appreciated! If you don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing in the comments, please feel free to PM me. Thank you!!!"

ASHA is proposing that new applicants who are not native English speakers must prove their language proficiency in English in order to obtain their Cs. I have linked ASHA\u2019s survey regarding this above. It is only 3 questions long. Please take this survey to voice your opinions regarding this.\n\nPersonally, I am VERY against the proposal. The USA doesn\u2019t have an official language so forcing applicants to be proficient in English serves no purpose. Also, having another required test in the application process is just an extra expense and an additional barrier to our field. In addition, this is blatantly discriminatory being that only non native speakers are required to complete this step of the application. Our field requires so much more diversity than it currently has, and all this will do is prevent diversification. I feel this requirement is not only discriminatory, but also both racist and classist. I would like to prevent ASHA from continuing it\u2019s legacy of discrimination. \n\nWhether or not you agree with me, I hope you choose to take the survey to allow your voice to be heard."

At the top, a massive liquid morkite cargo rocket platform (or for a pallet swap, nitra). The usual additional three geysers are at the bottom of the mountain, allowing the players to create grind pathways down the mountain slope.\nPerhaps each geyser could be in their own side chamber with themes, like a Nausica-style cavern garden full of beer-related plants. Another could be a random side material like pearls, compressed gold, whatever. The third could be full to the brim with bugs and praetorians. \n\nThe challenge would be to keep the whole mountain pumping during a time period (30m normal, 60m gauntlet). Along the slope are assorted objectives from ebonuts to mini mules. Perhaps some new objectives like collecting kegs or forming red sugar crystals with some lasers or something. \n\nHere is the kicker: no nitra. Instead, and this fits with the idea of nitra geysers, a supply can be summoned every so often for free. This rate can be increased with a sub objective of fracking crevices that arch between the lower geysers. \n\nThe ultimate payoff of this mission could be an increased credits and a corporate gift of a special one-off brew on the menu that gives an irl week buff to experience, credits, or whatever.\n\n\nOr like a blanket 25% discount on the market. \n\nHow could this be made better?"

                "created_utc": 1652176187.0,
                "body": "Why I think this is unpopular: I see so much \"kpop slander\" these days, how everything is worse than it was back in the days, and no one seems to remember that the good old back in the days did many of the same things or had many of the same problems.\n\nLet's start with the lip syncing.\nIt annoys me too, I love live vocals, I love imperfections, but its not a new disease. In the early 2010s the same thing was going around. So many songs were full of over the top autotune cos it was a trend at the time, that most performances were lip synced cos humans just can't sound like that. Now today the trend isn't extreme autotune, but extreme dances, where its equally impossible to perform the song live.\n\nLip syncing also obviously isn't just a problem of 4th gen groups, which seem to be always at the receiving end of all the hate, it's just a trend rn that nearly all artists have to participate in. Even the ones praised for real amazing vocals a few years ago have most performances lip synced today, likely because they are just forced to by their company. Like taeyeon or mamamoo. So let's not pretend like it's just the newcomers bcos they can't sing.\n\nThen the next thing: repetitive concepts.\nPeople looove to complain how every boyband sounds the same nowadays, how every girl group does girl crush and they miss the variety back in the days.\nMeanwhile the variety back in the days was so so so many cute concepts, that F(X) could be created by SM because there was such a huge gap in the market for anything non cute.\nCute and sexy concepts were like the only concepts girl groups were allowed to do for well over a decade, so I can't be mad for a lot of them trying out different things now that it's widely accepted and popular.\nAnd even then, there is far more variety in concepts nowadays than there has been 10 years ago. So if you're sick of a concept, it'll be worth the time to look around and find another group with something more to you're liking, there's always something different.\n\nThen, the \"4th gen is just a dance competition\" as if previous gens didn't also have insanely intense choreos where dancing was put before vocals, and the performances main selling point was the hard choreo. \nFor the dance intense groups, look at bts, seventeen, infinite, nct, Monsta x, wanna one, long list. GGs are hard to find for this because... There were a lot of cute concepts... Gfriend did amazing choreos and would be my first choice for the gg section, but it's hard to match an intense workout choreo to a cute concept.\n\n\nLast point is the most difficult one, because this very likely just came to be as a chain reaction.\nThere already have been waves of idols interacting more, them getting insane hate and attacks from opposing gender group fans, then interactions going down, and then later resurfacing only for the pattern to begin again.\nAnd when we look at the amount of dangerous things sasaengs did to idols for a simple rumor, i am not surprised they try to prevent that from happening.\n\nWe have less fun interactions from idols to look at, but luckily we also have less news of idols injuring themselves on razorblades hidden in letters, being poisoned from fan gifts, attacked onstage, the list is long.\nBut yeah unfortunately it's not new that idols try to prevent rumours, happened already in early kpop stages, 2000-2010.\n\n\nSo to sum this long essay up... This all feels very familiar to the boomer statements starting with \"back in my days..\".\nIt's normal to idolise the times when you were new at something and excited about everything, and in general we remember the good things of the past more than the bad, but I would just wish that people would tone down their complaints. Cos at the receiving ends are real people, real idols, who do their best, and more often than not end up seeing these comments of people that are essentially just reminiscing the past by insulting current kpop.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/umezk4)"

If a group doesn't have many fans, it doesn't matter how good their music is, they don't get the votes.\n\nI think this much is clear to most fans. But what just irks me, is when people debate about their favourite artists or songs and bring in wins.\n\nFor example how ppl say twice's music is better or more beloved than black pinks, because they have so many more wins. Ignoring that they also have about 5 times as many comebacks.\n\nOr ppl comparing BTS to.. Well anything. I haven't met a single kpop fan who has ptd, butter or dynamite as their all time favourite song, yet they are the most awarded songs from them.\n\nSo I don't get how people can still argue about a groups musical quality, when their only argument is \"oh yeah then why do they have zero wins\"\n\nBecause they're from a small label, don't promote properly, or have too few comebacks.\nWins are a good way for the fandom to see how its growing, and how their group gains popularity. But that's it.\n\nThey shouldn't be used as a sign of quality or.. Catchiness.\n\nAlso proven by the amount of songs that were an absolute hit and you couldn't escape them at the time, but because most ppl didn't have them as their favourite groups, or they just went up against massive comebacks, they didn't get a single win.\nMinute of silence for Pentagon's shine, taemins move, svt Aju nice, the list goes on.\n\nI think this is unpopular because I see it brought up on so many different platforms all the time, and no one seems to argue against it.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/u12z9y)"

When I started therapy I was severely depressed, and didn't have any interest in sex, like its been for as long as I can remember, so I crossed the last box.\n\nThen during our sessions, we talked a lot about sexuality, my fears, my real needs, and last year I discovered that what really described myself was Asexuality, and she helped me a lot to get to that realisation and showed me some communities and forums to find like minded people, and it's been a life changer for me.\n\nAnd now yesterday, we had our last session. And as part of the final comparisons and my progress, I filled out the questionnaire again, ticked the same box as two years ago and added a happy smiley face.\n\nAnd when we went through the results, she smiled at the happy face and counted it as 0 points, so a healthy answer, and told me she is rarely that happy about a before and after answer having the same result, and that she's proud of me :)\n\nShe also gifted me a rock as a final parting gift, it looks like a tiny universe and it reminded her of me and I should always remember the progress I made and my life is as limitless as my little universe rock.\n\nIt's been a really emotional goodbye for me and I couldn't really share it with anyone, so I just had to let someone know :)\n\nThank you guys for being here, I'm happy I joined the crew"

You aren't able to conclude the relationship on your own terms. It hurts. \n\nDo you have a lot of time left between now and the final date? Please share with your T how all this has made you feel. Hopefully your T can help you to process your grief. You may ask if it will be okay to write to her after termination, like a life update once in a while. This may help you feel less like she is just gone. Also ask if she would respond to that kind of letter.\n\nYou may consider what you can do to help prepare for this change, and to gain closure with your T.

Often in this kind of situation, there is a deeper meaning. Sex can represent vulnerability and intimacy. So if someone had a dream of having sex with their therapist, it could mean they are feeling more comfortable being vulnerable in therapy. A sign that it is working! \n\nBasically, the safe space of therapy should be a place for a client bringing in anything they need to, and don't have to worry about the T's feelings.

It is perfectly natural to want to show appreciation to your T, although it is not an obligation nor required.  Whether or not you are interested in giving your T a gift is your own personal preference. \n\nTherapists will have their own preferences and boundaries around gift receiving.  The safest thing to do would be to ask your T beforehand if it would be okay and if they would accept a gift.  Some therapists may have a dollar limit, only accept certain things, or some may not accept any gifts.  When a therapist has this policy, it means in their opinion it is what is best for their clients. Sometimes a T may not accept a gift because they are worried about how their use of the gift may make the client feel. For example, a T could not display your art piece if it would break confidentiality, and may worry that could offend you. It is best to talk to your T to know what their stand is. \n\nIf your T is okay with receiving gifts, typically it should be something of low monetary value.  Examples of pretty safe gifts (but check with your own T first) could be a card, poem, or something you made yourself. Some therapists may also accept something edible for them, and/or that could be shared with their office mates."

I thought, this material is so rich with in depth explanation that I just have to recommend this resource to everyone. \n\nEpisode on Spotify:  [https://open.spotify.com/episode/0RrnKEZ1kIa9GwsCGSvXMX?si=1fd92b0888fb4736](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0RrnKEZ1kIa9GwsCGSvXMX?si=1fd92b0888fb4736)\n\nSome people don't realize that they have feelings of transference. Some people know they have transference feelings, but don't know that that it can be described by transference. And some people have transference feelings that they are aware of, but are at a loss as to why they have them or what to do about it. This episode gives a fantastic explanation of what transference is, how it could come to be, and how the therapeutic relationship can heal it. \n\nHere are some points/the gist from Dr. Kirk's lecture. \n\nDr. Kirk received an email from a patron. She had fear and anxiety around men.  For the first time she was seeing a male therapist. Soon she started to have nightmares about him, in the role of the abuser, which were terrifying.\n\nHe defines transference as a defense mechanism, and a form of displacement and projective identification.  Basically, \"we transfer our difficulties that we have internalized from our early relationships onto our therapist. In other words as we grow up we experience difficulties with our parents, we internalize the difficulties, they become internal conflicts, and then we transfer, reenact, or displace them onto our therapist.\"\n\nFor example, if someone's mother abandoned them as a child, they may displace those feelings onto their T. This may cause them to feel like their T doesn't really want them as a client, even though it's not true.\n\nThe patron realized that as she started to deepen her relationship with her T and become familiar with him, she started to feel more vulnerable around him. When someone is vulnerable around another person, there is greater potential to be hurt by them.  \n\nHowever in relational therapy being vulnerable is a good thing.  \"A good quality, competent T will live up tot he hope of the client by not hurting the client. By valuing that vulnerability and respecting it. Through relationship therapy, people can begin to heal the wounds of the past... The relationship between T and client can prove over time experientially to the client that they can trust someone. as they learn to trust someone they learn many things on a visceral level not just cogvgnive.t they can learn they can trust someone, they are worthy of being treated humanely.\"\n\nA T who can navigate those waters with their client can prove to their client that at least one person can be trusted. This is felt on a subconscious level. One can believe it is true.\n\nHe also went on to say that children who are abused by their parents utilize a defense mechanism.  Children believe their parents are invincible and flawless, because they have to be.  Children are very vulnerable and their parents must protect them. So that means if a child is experiencing abuse, it is because they have done something wrong, not their parents. \n\nThe patron was able to talk about what she was experiencing with her T and is working through it.  Talking about our feelings is a powerful thing. A competent T should appreciate when someone can share their honest feelings and will value that discussion.\n\nHe also makes some points about why relational therapy is effective for CPTSD, compared to cognitive therapy.  Cognitive therapy can help, but relational therapy can reach those deep, guarded wounds. \n\nThis is the end of my summary of the podcast. For a clearer picture, I recommend others to listen to it, if they can find the time."

I have some questions about some of the logistics, background, and what the behind the scenes stuff is like.  For instance:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. What is it like to do notes?\n2. Do you have any preparation tasks, or rituals you do to get ready to see a client? \n3. What is it like to talk to your supervisor?\n4. What is it like to be a part of a group consultation?\n5. Do you get pressured from people in director/executive positions at your workplace?\n\nTraining Questions \n\n1. What was it like to get through your masters and/or doctorate program? Did you have to write a lot of papers? What are the assignments like?\n2. How did you decide if you wanted to specialize in something in particular, or practice a certain modality? \n3. Do you end up bonding and becoming friends with your classmates? Or maybe you noticed that people would share a common interest?\n4. Is it difficult to be in workplace conversations with your social circle? I get because of HIPAA you aren't able to give away a lot of details.  Maybe there are general things you can talk about?   \n\n\nFulfillment Questions \n\n1. What is your favorite part of being a therapist? \n2. How does it feel when you receive positive feedback from a client? \n3. How does it make you feel if a client can graduate therapy and feel as if they successfully completed their treatment with you?  Does this happen often? \n\nThis is a lot of questions, so it's okay if anyone would like to answer only some of them!  I just think therapy is really cool and wonder a lot about what the role is like. \n\nThanks for being therapists and supporting our society!  I have so much appreciation for you.  T's save lives by healing the invisible wounds people try to  hide.  You truly make the world a better place by encouraging us to actually believe in ourselves.  You're amazing."

I don't post on insta, while she does (yet another thing to fixate on as a difference) - like it's- I get frustrated most of the time when I watch her stories cause of politics, so it would be best if I just ignore her insta stories - and then she posts something I agree with and I find myself wanting to see *more* of what she has to say.\n\nI guess like what I could do to deal with it is just talk to her but I have no idea how to approach her.

My illegal name is Trojan (as opposed to my \"legal\" name that I keep because I'm just terrified of having to explain to my parents or family members if they see the change in documents)\n\nI have a very complicated relationship with gender - so much frustration that for the most part the label that has given me any semblance of comfort is \"arsongender\" - a disconnect from gender and a desire to burn the social construct to the ground.\n\nAnother label I liked ages ago was \"cassgender\" - feeling your gender is not important to your identity. But that label could never fit me in a society that insists on gendering me. I don't want it to be important, but it's forced upon me.\n\nI get so distressed when I have to have talks about gender. My 20th birthday was a few days ago. Instead of getting birthday wishes someone insistently mocked my chosen name - distorting it into a feminine version and I fucking spiraled. I demanded she stop. She persisted and I was crying.\n\nI hate being identified as female. \n\nShortly after that name mockery fest I got a text message from my mom greating me for my birthday - in my language **all adjectives and verbs** are **gendered**. I hate it. I hate it.\nIt was a pain reading her birthday wishes in the feminine. The cherry on topple was her calling me \"young lady\". I thanked her for the wish numbly and asked her to not call me \"young lady\". I'M A YOUNG PERSON - NEVER A LADY.\n\nAnd this freaking woman. \"Your [gender/sex] (these words are the same in my language it will kill me one day) is a lady. What you want to be called is an entirely different topic. I'm sorry.\"\n\nDisgusting, I was quivering. I wanted to literally just curl up and cry. I had told my mom ages ago (well 2 years ago when she moved out) that I was \"trans\" - that I at the very least didn't identify as a \"woman\". I loathe that coming out. Not only did she trample on my bodily autonomy, but she has the gaul to forget my coming out. \"Do whatever you want with your body, but first give birth.\"\n\nNever, never, never FUCKING NEVER.\n\nI have other like uncomfortable talks about gender - like having to explain to a friend that I'm not fucking genderfluid after the fucking name mocking fest. AFTER THE NAME MOCKING FEST SOME CHICK DECIDED TO ASK \"How can you be misgendered if you're genderfluid?\"\n\nHOW??? BLOODY HOW?????? I'LL TELL YOU HOW - I TOLD THAT BITCH TO STOP MOCKING MY NAME. AND ON TOP OF THAT - I AIN'T FUCKING GENDERFLUID.\n\nI identified as genderfluid as the first step on unraveling my gender - when I was around 13  I found out about trans people and genderfluid people. I told myself \"No way I could be a boy- I mean atleast not permanently- it's much safer where I am to play it like I am shifting between what I want and what is expected of me\"\n\nI don't know what I am - not because of anything else but because society made gender so complicated. I want to burn it. I want none of the opression, the objectifying glances, the way I get treated for bits of flesh, the way I will get treated if I get rid of those bits of flesh.\n\nI do want to end this ramble on a better note tho.\nGender is complicated. But xenogender and neurodivergent people showed me how beautiful that complicatedness can be. I myself am neurodivergent, but was forced to accept the narrative that \"I'm a normal kid\". So at the start of exploring gender I overlooked xenogenders and even watched people mocked them.\nBut then I decided to immerse myself in a xenogender community. These people are inspiring. Some people think it's weird to have a gender based on aesthetics - I feel it so much better than essentialists perspectives that my AFAB ass should subject myself to torture. They know what they feel - they may describe it differently (soft and warm, not \"feminine\" whatever the fuck that means), but they know and I love them for it. \n\nI want a world where people can express themselves.\nPeace,\nTrojan (he/they)"

I just want it to be easier to learn about this stuff in school, we have student vote, and I know so many people under 18 who know politics better than some people who are over 18 who wont register to vote. While most are living with their parents at 16 its so much easier to develop a habit of voting with your family! I hate how most of the adults I know literally just pick who seems okay at first glance, or the other candidates they didn't know much about, or hey this local guy is my dad's friend let me choose him! I hate it and I hate where these people's sources are from and making us high school students recieve that opportunity to vote seems like it would immensely help our social studies courses and actually help students become more involved!",

I have to be honest, ive had puppy crushes but this has lasted almost 5 years and i think i really love him. Ik i dont wanna rush stuff, but its so weird, its being able to have fun and actually hang out with him.  its the fact that i geniunely enjoy his time and opinions, but i feel stupid cause ik i shouldnt feel this way at 16 and im probably overreacting. Its just weird cause it always felt and still feels like he'll always be there every step of the way, but i just feel like, idk im really dumb for thinking like this, people tell me its impossible to love and stuff but at the same time everyone can see how i feel about him, im just confused."

Could there be any other solutions? \n\nI'm making a small game, and I'm not sure if implementing these would fit in the scope. It is a 2-8 player board-like game and there is basically only one winner. (...which means more players will be in this situation) \n\nAnother problem with the progression system is that I don't plan to maintain servers for the player data, so  it would be stored locally. I don't know, if there is any game that exists like this, but then the players could just download a file to replace their progression. \n\nSo, are there any other ways to solve this problem with discouragement? \n\n(Also, a broader question, generally what could incentivize players to play more matches despite winning or losing?)"

The only problems, I am having is not being able to get my phone number transferred to me sadly, I went to Rogers (I live in Canada), and they said I'll need to ask the owner of my account to make that change which is my N-father, and I don't want to change numbers but if any one of have any idea what could be done that would be helpful! Even my boss at work was fine and assured me that no information would be given to my parents if they tried contacting the company.

I got another job in September and my relationship with my parents got slightly better until they started acting like they used to. My past two weekends were horrible due to what was being said to me and the threats of violence. After crying myself to sleep on Saturday I told myself I would escape soon. First things I did was get the required documents I needed, my N-mom has my passport but I know how to get it back, I applied for many rental adds and asked work for a job letter which I got today and I\u2019ve let work know as well that I\u2019ll be moving out shortly. Now since I live in Canada I\u2019m not sure about two things, if I want to apply for a no contact order or restraining order how may I go about that? I do not have much evidence on my mother threatening me (i can try if it happens again) and I need a landlord reference for which I don\u2019t know what to do. Please let me know what would be the best options and any other tips will be much appreciated. Thank you all so so much!!"

They will banter and share jokes with me about the most random topics. Students have said to me that I'm their favourite teacher because I let them be themselves and listen to them when they talk. Some of my colleagues are also really funny, and we will often joke around together during our breaks. \n\nI laugh very easily at the smallest and dumbest things, and especially at myself lol. You don't even have to know any special technique or comedic jokes, just be real and share in the humour with others around you (okay I'm kind of lame....I do this even when I'm alone by myself. One time I was cry-laughing for 10 minutes straight after I saw a side profile photo of me taken at a bad angle, it looked like I had no neck or chin lmaoo). I get my humour from funny scenes and dialogue in movies/tv shows/books, sharing childhood stories with my siblings, watching TikToks, and mucking around with my husband where our (sometimes gross) sense of humour is one of the biggest factors to our bonding.\n\nThat being said, your sense of humour needs to be genuine. Don't force yourself to laugh at something you don't find funny. Your humour should also not be hurtful to others; don't laugh at the expense of someone else (I love sarcasm but never use it towards anyone). It also goes without saying not to bring in race, religion or politics. \n\nLaugh openly and with a heartfelt feeling, it makes you feel better and releases feel-good chemicals such as endorphins. It also relieves stress, relieves pain, and improves your immune system. Another bonus I've noticed is how flush and radiant it makes your skin look and how your eyes sparkle. \n\nDon't always take yourself so seriously, find the humour in the little things of everyday life. \n\n(Also please share any dad jokes you know, I want to use them in a conversation next time so everyone can sigh \ud83e\udd13)\n\n**EDIT:** My post does not contain any mention of what attracts/doesn\u2019t attract men. It\u2019s about increasing your radiance and forming your own sense of humour, not about trying to out-joke someone or make it a competition. I\u2019ve observed it time and time again that people who can share a sense of humour and have a laugh with others \u2014all men and women\u2014 are considered more charming. That\u2019s the purpose of this post lol."

                "body": "So you have got your wardrobe all set, you have dyed your hair, gotten facial treatments, managed your weight, and had any other obvious physical features sorted out including your teeth, makeup and maybe cosmetic procedures if you got that done.\n\nBut, my dear ladies.\n\nAnd I know this may sound very obvious, but there are some features you may overlook in your glow up, or more often, in your daily/weekly beauty routine. Here is a list of the following to keep in check so you're always neat, clean, glowing and polished:\n\n\u2014 Get them callouses filed away! So many times, I've seen women all done up and dressed to the nines, and they're wearing lovely open shoes but then...dry, cracked heels. Callouses and ashiness, sometimes even yellow and chipped nails. It ain't a nice look. Your feet deserve your love, too. Make sure you exfoliate them weekly at least with a pumice stone or foot file. Apply body butter afterwards and focus especially on the toes and in between, and finish with a lotion.\n\n\u2014 Apply nice smelling lotion or body butter/yogurt when you get ready for the day, and keep hand lotion in your bag to use throughout the day so your hands stay moisturised and supple.\n\n\u2014 If you get your nails done, make sure they are maintained and not chipped. If you keep them bare, they should be neatly trimmed and filed to shape, with a clear or coloured nail polish on top. Do not however, ever, let dirt cake underneath them. Yes you see children with nails like this, but I've also seen it on grown professional adults. It's one of my biggest pet peeves and looks as though you never wash your hands...which sadly may be the case for some of these people.\n\n\u2014 Make sure you're checking your shoulders after doing your hair. Dandruff can be present on there, so brush off your shoulders and arms. There was a colleague once who had a lot of dandruff on her shoulders and back, it was obvious even from a distance. Brush off your shoulders!\n\n\u2014 Likewise, get rid of any dandruff or dry skin flakes visible in your hairline. I have a dry scalp in winter and this problem shows up, so I oil my hair more often to hydrate my scalp, and comb my hair properly in front of the mirror when getting ready to make it tidy and clean.\n\n\u2014 Keep your breath smelling nice and fresh with some mints in your bag or a breath freshener spray. Use the spray discreetly though, not an elegant look when done in front of others! Also make sure you are regularly brushing your teeth and getting dental check ups when needed, this is a given of course.\n\n\u2014 Don't walk around with crusty cracked lips. Keep a lip balm on hand to touch up when you're out in the cold or just drank water/ate a meal. I use a tinted Burts Bees one and it feels nice on my lips, plus doesn't make that white ring around the edges.\n\n\u2014 Be mindful of how you eat. I'm a messy eater at times, I love digging into my food and relishing it, so I always make sure there are tissues nearby to clean my mouth and hands of any spills. Another story of a colleague who was eating a chocolate bar and it crusted on their lips because of not using a tissue. The crust was not removed all day. Please don't do this. Other people WILL notice that food stuck on your mouth, teeth or anywhere else but not say anything about it.\n\n\u2014 Be mindful of the expressions your face makes unconsciously. Especially your \"concentration\" face. My sister pointed my one out once, how my eyebrows tend to bunch together, and now when I'm reading something I make sure my face is neutral, because the lines your face makes will stay there over time. This doesn't include your laughing face though, smile lines are completely normal from movement. One of my relatives makes a really exaggerated squint when she talks or is out in the sun, and those lines are still there when her face is neutral. Even my husband used to do these expressions until I pointed it out to him and now he is also aware of it.\n\n\u2014 Keep a straight posture. This may be a more known tip, but slouching and walking hunched not only doesn't look good, but shows a lack of self confidence. I watch a lot of videos on Old Hollywood/Bollywood actresses, and a part of why they exude so much radiance and elegance is through their straight, poised posture. Practice walking in front of a mirror to improve your posture, and also when holding a bag or phone in your hand.\n\n\u2014 Make sure your makeup is neatly applied. Don't let eyeliner collect in the corner of your eye, or lipstick crust on your lips. This is the reason why I do my makeup close up and right in front of the mirror so that it's applied evenly and I can clean off any debris with a q-tip, tissue or fluffy brush. I love wearing lipstick, but it's definitely harder to manage during the day. Keep a few lipsticks but of high quality ones that apply smoothly and don't dry out your lips or leave a ring. Satin formulas are the best for this and most easy to manage. Liquid is the toughest so I only wear that occasionally and will touch it up with normal lipstick later on.\n\n\u2014  Always wear cute, pretty lingerie underneath your clothes. The set should be matching, but also be comfortable to wear. It's a cultural trope that you only wear lingerie for a brief period of time when with your partner. Don't treat it that way and start wearing it as a part of your outfit underneath. Only you know you're wearing it, but the confidence you feel will be on another level. Also check if you are wearing the correct size, the calculator over at r/abrathatfits/ is the most accurate one for your bra size. If you have back or neck pain, if your straps slip down and there is gapping or squishing in the cups, then you are most likely wearing the wrong size. Bras should be comfortable and give support. Wearing the right one will achieve this, and also look way more better under your clothes. I actually enjoy wearing a bra now once I found my proper size, because it fit me properly for once.\n\nAnd that's it for now! This is all I can think of at the moment, but if you have any other lesser known beauty tips please comment them below <3\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your comments!

                "body": "Hi all, I have been browsing this sub lately and came across this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/comments/t70g3n/i\\_know\\_this\\_is\\_problematic\\_but\\_nothing\\_will\\_ever/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/comments/t70g3n/i_know_this_is_problematic_but_nothing_will_ever/) \n\nI can feel OP's pain, and as someone who has been on both ends of the spectrum, here are my thoughts, tips, and ways to prevent it from happening. \n\n**Appearance**\n\n\\- Back in high school, I was the nice friend, but not one of the hot popular girls. That was okay with me, but I never received much male attention(which I was also okay with at the time, as an introvert I didn't like attention).  Physically I was very skinny, but also had bad acne on my face and back. My hair was a messy bush, and got greasy quick. We all wore school uniforms so that was the same for us all. I'm a WOC, and at the time the beauty standard was being tall, athletic and blonde. The girls who looked like this got a lot of male attention. \n\n\\- By the time I started university, I was doing my brows, and got laser to remove facial hair, but my fashion sense was still atrocious, and my skin still wasn't all clear. The worse however was my hair, it had began to fall out a lot after a treatment at a salon(don't know if that even directly caused it), but it was now short, frizzy and thin. I spent most of my time at university being by myself because of social awkwardness, and made only a few close friends. None of them were male, who I kind of avoided anyway. For a year I was really into radical feminist politics and was actively hating men and anything to do with femininity. This was not only extreme about the actual reality, but really harmful for my mental and emotional wellbeing. I ditched all politics when I realised it was contributing to my depression, and chose to start focusing on myself because life is short and I didn't want to spend it being miserable. \n\n\\- With my studies finished, I began casual work as a secondary school teacher. My hair was thankfully healthy again and I had grown it long to tailbone length. But what did I do? I chucked up in a bun at all times, and didn't even have any face framing pieces or bangs. Gosh lol. I only wore loose black pants with a loose black utility top, and a huge black puffer jacket in winter. Now I understand why my sister used to make fun of me. Also note that I was still skinny, but dressed so bland and basic that it hindered me. Being skinny is pointless if you don't dress well or maintain yourself. \n\n\\- Later on, I earned good money, learnt about feminine energy, and the importance of spending on oneself. Before, I just saved all my cash. Now I actually spent it on myself properly and openly for once. But I made sure to focus on the important things. Clothes: gone were the ugly pants and puffer, and replaced with flowing maxi dresses and skirts with cute wrap blouses. I learnt about my Kibbe ID and dressed accordingly. I ditched all black and incorporated colour. I got my acne under control and gave myself weekly facials. I cut my hair to mid-length and got a dark brown balayage(later got it dyed with honey blonde highlights on a dark brown base), with curtain bangs. I left my hair mostly out and curled it with a robe overnight. While I dressed cute now and had my hair done nice, comfort and ease still mattered to me, so I kept it light on the makeup and just applied spf, powder, some liner, lipstick and blush. Also only wore heels on occasion but otherwise wore combat boots or flats. The difference in my appearance, and thereby my confidence, was like night and day. My mental health was in good check, I was happy a lot and laughing at silly things(I have the dumbest and driest sense of humour lol), and was generally living through feminine energy, taking my time to get ready in the morning with music in the background, having breakfast and tea, humming or singing to myself. I carried that calm, joyful energy through the day.\n\n And like that I became \"that\" girl. The one who guys saw sunshine and flowers when they looked my way, especially the ones who ignored me before. Some even went out their way to talk to me. It was an astounding difference honestly. \n\n**Feminine energy**\n\n\\- I know this sub is look-based, and truly your looks do matter in society no matter what progressive ideas we have about it, but feminine energy is also one of the biggest contributors to your attraction and allure. So what exactly is feminine energy? It's your essence of being a woman, of feeling comfortable as a woman, and relishing in your right to sensuality and pleasure. Feminine energy is light and warmth, kindness and compassion, the dark side of the moon, the ebb and flow of the ocean,  and the sweetness of slowing down and savouring every sense and every feeling. It's about genuinely feeling your emotions and not putting up a wall, of being playful, not taking yourself seriously, and softening your voice and your mannerisms. There's a lot more to feminine energy I can link but this is the basis of it. \n\n\\- Men are incredibly sensitive to feminine energy and will pick it up even if you're dressed in a potato sack. We're in a masculine based society right now where it's all about pushing yourself and being on the go go go. You're encouraged to toughen up and show how independent and \"strong\" you are, and truly, for some of us our life circumstances or past negative relationships make us this way, so we end up neglecting our feminine side or think of it in negative terms, or that it's only about having a feminine appearance. Masculine energy is all about doing, and it helps us get work done, but has the opposite effect in relationships, because a man doesn't want to come home to someone like him.\n\n**The eyes, chico, they never lie**\n\n\\- Yes, being skinny and pretty will get you attention that's a truth. But your demeanour does matter as you interact with each other. When you're very hurt and upset about something, look at yourself in the mirror.  Look at your eyes. Do you see the pain there? Even when you try to keep your face neutral, do you see the sadness reflecting back at you? I have seen it in my face when I have gone through some difficult times. Even after I had stopped crying and went about my day, every time I would catch my face in the mirror, I saw someone else looking back at me. Stress takes control of your whole body and shows up in every part of your being. Ladies, you're your most important person in life, be ever so kind to yourself and make pampering and self-care your daily ritual because they do help. \n\n\\- Life, and especially relationships of all kinds, can be so difficult, but you have to stay diplomatic and put your wellbeing first. I realise that now after so many years. Take baths, lavish ones with candles and nice smelling soaps, exfoliate yourself, play nice music, and most importantly, touch your skin, slowly, feel yourself, close your eyes, and exhale through your mouth. You're wild and raw and absolutely beautiful. You're a whole damn *woman* and you should be proud of it. So now, when I'm genuinely happy and feeling good, I see myself in the mirror, and my eyes are sparkling, my face is flush and radiant. I glow from inside and out. I receive far more male attention, and practically none when going through a depressive phase, even though I looked the same. It's the eyes. \n\n**Language and manners**\n\n\\- Similar to the way your eyes convey your emotions and thoughts, the way you speak, and what you speak about also matters. If you're someone who casually always swears, talks about any topic that comes up, then the guy in front of you will see you as a literal equal to him. You will be fun to hang around and chat about these topics as a *friend*. But he won't see you as a woman. I don't swear at all in the workplace, a bit here and there when with siblings or friends, but not with colleagues. But my colleagues do swear with each other, even when talking to men. And those same men treat me very differently when talking to me. They're mindful of their language and manners. The way you talk to others is the way they will talk to you. The way you treat yourself is they way others will treat you.\n\n**Friendships**\n\n\\- I know we have guy friends and that's totally fine, but I have never sought out to be friends with men. Even as colleagues men are respectful and we converse, but it's nothing deep and I stay composed so to speak, I'm not all wacky like I am with friends(and that's completely fine, as humans we interact with others differently depending on who it is and our level of comfort). I seem almost shy, calm, and kind. They interact with me as a woman, not one of the guys, simply because I'm myself and don't seek out to befriend them. \n\n\\- Kindness is underrated imo, being genuinely nice to others and showing concern does wonders I'm telling you. It's so attractive and makes others feel nice. And a big part of attraction is of course, how good the other person feels around you. Energy is a funny thing though, because while I am reserved but polite with straight male colleagues, when they're gay the exchange is completely different and I am much more open as they are usually more feminine. Now also that I'm married I don't seek out any friendships with men, the energy exchange is just so different and at times can be intense. When a man sees you as a woman, you will feel it at once in a single interaction. If you're single and looking for a relationship you can take the interaction further from there. As an attractive and feminine behaving woman you simply have a lot more options, that's a societal fact. \n\nYou don't need to prove yourself to anyone. You don't need to prove yourself as a woman that you're just as strong and capable and independent as a man. He doesn't care about that. And neither should you. See him as a man and not a work friend, and he will feel like a man. You're a beautiful and sensual woman striving to be her best self in her own world, and enjoying her life and the sweetness of being present, who doesn't fucking care about trying to prove herself for anyone."

One bra in particular by Berlei literally made me forgot I was wearing one. It\u2019s the t-shirt one with moulded cups, and is so comfortable to wear. It\u2019s on the pricier side at $70AUD each but I got it for $46 on sale, and bought two. The price is justified because of how nice they feel, especially in this hot summer weather.\n\nI\u2019m on holidays right now and went to an outlet store for Simone P\u00e9r\u00e8le, where bras run for $100+, but to my luck they had a stand for bras and panties at only $10, and the bras were only in 8F my size!! I can\u2019t find F size bras anywhere except online, so this was such an excellent bargain that I grabbed a few. \n\nI now have a bit of a lingerie addiction since finding my right size lol, because not only are my bras comfier but they also look good on me unlike before."

                "body": "For years I thought I was a 14B(36B US), but after taking the calculator I found out I\u2019m actually an 8F(30G).\n\nEvery bra used to give me back pain. I thought it was the underwire, so I kept going up band sizes to make the pain stop. It didn\u2019t. So I started wearing wirefree bras. And I still had back pain. Then I thought it was the material, the brand, and eventually thought that my body was just weird and didn\u2019t like bras, because nothing ever felt comfortable enough.\n\nAll these years of fussing around and trying new bras has led to a collection of unworn bras sitting in my drawer. \n\nAnd now, I just can\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t fitted myself earlier. I\u2019m someone who is very informative about fashion and tailored clothing. I know what fabric and cuts suit my body lines(Kibbe body styles), and even how to style/cut my hair in the way that suits me. Yet with bras, I just thought they were supposed to be ill-fitting. I really thought that the band riding all the way up my back was normal, or the straps falling off, and the cups going up when I lifted my arms. \n\nNever did I ever imagine I would be a bigger cup, because we have been taught to think that anything C+ is humungous. That\u2019s far from the the truth, because while yes those sizes are larger, it\u2019s all in relative to your body frame. I have much smaller underbust, yet for years I kept going up band sizes not realising the problem. \n\nI took the calculator test for fun after finding this sub(there was something that triggered my need to measure myself, but I can\u2019t remember what). While my results gave 8F, I settled for the 10E option it also mentioned for a more comfortable fit, which is more important to me at the moment lol. Then I went out searching for my size and was in disappointment. 10E, let alone 8F is only stocked at pricey department stores, and even they have limited options. Now I understand all the memes about bigger bras being plain and ugly! \n\nRegardless, there\u2019s the Boxing Day sales on right now, so I bought 3 bras, which included the Bonds Invisi underwire t-shirt, Bonds wirefree, and Berlei barely there contour bra. \n\nI wore the Bonds underwire one today. It felt tight at first. I\u2019ve become so used to wearing loose bands that this felt restricting. But my breasts had never felt so supported, the calculator was right! I went out for hours, and did not get any back pain at the end. And the bra didn\u2019t move in any way either. Before, I would jog a little and everything would fly like helicopters, heartbreaking to remember.\n\nJust, wow. I would never have known my size, even if I got it done by a professional. This calculator is legit and honestly the most accurate. My girls are supported now, but the only downside is finding my size, and that too in an affordable range. My sister size is 12 DD/DDD, which I got the wirefree one in, but I wish we had more options.\n\nSeriously, I am so thankful that this sub exists!"

First time my husband and I had been trying for nine months, and second time was first try without protection. \n\nAfter the miscarriages we took a break from trying and booked with a specialist, and it took three months after our first consultation in January to get the RPL testing done. Everything came back normal for us both, including all the bloods, semen analysis, karyotyping and HyCosy. \n\nOur specialist then recommended I go on Letrozole(Femara) for three months, and if nothing happened to then get a laparoscopy to check for endo. If I got a positive then she said to take aspirin and progesterone.\n\nWell, nothing happened with my first two cycles on the Letrozole(I even had a follicle tracking scan for cycle one, which was all clear), but this was my third cycle so I tested yesterday as I normally do on 11dpo, and to my surprise it was a positive. I also tested on 10dpo and it was a very super faint positive, but I thought it was just an evaporation line and bought FRER sticks. We just moved into a new home and I\u2019ve been working from home since it\u2019s lockdown, but I didn\u2019t expect this.\n\nI\u2019m scared, but also so incredibly thankful I was able to conceive. I have been taking 200mg progesterone suppositories since yesterday and 100mg baby aspirin. I don\u2019t know what the outcome will be, but I feel more accepting about everything than I did the last two times. I haven\u2019t had my bloods yet, and again I\u2019m scared but just trying to take it one day at a time, especially when it\u2019s still so early."

[17] For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.\n\nHere are some words from the apostle Paul to consider:\n1 Corinthians 6:12-15 KJV\n[12] All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. [13] Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. [14] And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power. [15] Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.\n\nWe also have the idea that sexuality is originally mentioned in relation to marriage and partnership, being something that adds to the glory of God.\nWhile sexual relations within marriage are giving and glorifying, we the have to ponder the nature of masturbation. At most times, it\u2019s seen as something that serves self.\n\nLastly, if there are verses that tell us how \u201cnot\u201d to act, we also have verses that instead give us an idea of how we are to fashion ourselves too:\n\n1 Corinthians 6:19-20 KJV\n[19] What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? [20] For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\n\nPhilippians 4:8 KJV\n[8] Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.\n\n\nI really hope these give some Godly insight and wisdom into your situation. I pray you may consider them with full honesty and humility towards your own condition, and if you feel convinced or convicted of your actions reading any of these verses, that you\u2019ll be given the strength from God to repent and overcome.\n\nAgain..\n1 Corinthians 10:23 KJV\n[23] All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.",

You can refer to the correction in the thread below. I didn\u2019t know, but would like to be as biblically accurate if I can next time! Please read with this in mind :) ]\n\nPsalm 16:9-11 KJV\n\nPsalm 16:8 KJV\n[8] I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. [9] Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. [10] For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. [11] Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.\n\nI think this can speak to anyone who has ever struggled against their own sinful ways, against the \u201cflesh\u201d.\nIt\u2019s such a comforting group of passages because of its reassurance. It reassures us that even our flesh will \u201crest in hope.\u201d all because God will not leave the souls of those who trust Him in hell and neither will he suffer the Holy One to see corruption (in us I presume by the context!)\nBut how comforting is that for those of us who seem to struggle so much to know that he promises this: \u201cThou wilt shew me the path of life\u201d.\n\nWhen we become His children we are under His patient mercy and guidance. No matter how terrible we may feel as the Holy Spirit convicts us of our sins in our spirit.\n\nIt makes me remember another promise God made to His people too\n\nHebrews 8:10 KJV\n[10] For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:\n\nIf we look to the scriptures, we have so much hope. For the God who is for us and loves us has established His new covenant, entrusted to Jesus, that we might have His laws written into our hearts and minds.\nI just love these and wanted to share or remind :)"

It has slight detachment of the paper that wraps the slipcase, where I think it probably had an impact during shipping since there is some scuffing there as well (see photos).\n\nOtherwise I would say these are in like new condition.\n\nI do not want to split these up.\n\nThey were priced based on eBay sold prices (not a ton to go on there) and historical Amazon prices (via camelcamelcamel, ignoring any insane outliers, e.g. thousands of dollars).\n\nMy flair says 1 swap, but I've actually purchased 3 times here.

I thought he was sick for killing people, and short sighted for not understanding that crime cannot be decreased by mindless killings. For not understanding that we need to educate people and raise them with love. I hated Light for his twisted philosophy and I thought he was a really unjust, self righteous person with a god complex. I was angry and sad and beyond devastated when he managed to kill L. When he deceived his father. When he manipulated everyone around him. And I kept thinking, it'd be so satisfying when his secret finally comes out in light, when justice finally strikes down upon him. When he finally meets the sticky end he was destined for all along.\n\nBut in the last episode, when he was finally killed. I did not feel any satisfaction. I did not feel, \"yes, this is the perfect ending\". I just felt, horrible. I could feel Matsuda's anger, yes, his shock, I could understand how betrayed he must've felt but I never once felt satisfied to see Light Yagami finally lose control and get killed. In that moment, I realized that I was no better than all those Kira supporters thinking that a criminal dying will give them satisfaction, because it doesn't. Someone losing his life is a really unfortunate thing and it's terrible. I kept thinking of a young Light Yagami, and boy who genuinely had the potential to be a good person, I kept thinking of how he was when he lost his memory, and I just kept mourning the person he could've been.\n\nThe anime did a great job at driving it's point home. There is nothing happy about criminal justice. Anyone who takes satisfaction in people dying is needs medical help. Bad people aren't spawn randomly. No baby is born evil. The only way to change the world is to have love, empathy and open mindedness. Education and rehabilitation. Teaching parents how to treat their kids with love and care. Making sure that no one has to steal in order to survive. Teaching equality. That is what's necessary to change the world."

I didn't want to but well, I said smth about drivers licence and that hurt him real bad, because I didn't know he had personal issues with this topic... I apologized but well I think he's still mad and I feel awful.   \nMy friend says I couldn't have known and I explained to her why I acted like I did and that I'm sorry, with her it's fine thankfully.  \nI am now way more aware of how I act when I get this kind of panic mechanism, and I'll try to hold it back when it happens again.\n\nBut oof, I really try to live in peace with everybody, and after years I think this is the first time again, where I kinda well, feel like I don't live in peace with a person. And it's awful... I'm kinda scared to apologize again, and I also don't wanna bring it up because I feel so bad and am kinda scared of my friends boyfriend when he's mad.

I have an r5 stringless that she can use, but I want to know how would she perform at c0 and how necessary are her cons except c6. that way, i know if i should try to go for her constellations in character banners."

No 5\\* bows. I have raised the rust before I knew about the BP bow, but I'd like to consider the best weapon first.\n* I have enough primos to go through another round of weapon banner pity, and I'm ok with getting MoD. But if I fail, I might go all in for the bow with a dent in my wallet (I buy welkin but will consider spending if necessary for the occasion, since I rarely pull for 5\\* units).\n* I'm planning to pull Albedo if he has a rerun.\n\nAs for now, I'm thinking about waiting until the last day of the banner to see how many more primos I can gather. The next weapon banner wouldn't be as tempting even if skyward harp is featured, since I have guaranteed 50/50 here. Also, I'm also on 60 pity on standard banner and who knows, maybe I'll get skyward harp and not think about this post again, right...?"

Looking at the sub, I have heard that he needs a well-invested team of supports to shine, or that he is not very resin-friendly. Here are my thoughts. I often invest a lot in my supports (levels 70-80, talents 1/7/7 without cons bonus, has crit ratio of 50\\~70/100\\~140, atk 1400-1700) because I rely on mostly 4\\* units to clear content, so I may have a skewed idea of what is considered as \"high investment.\" If that's the standard for the supports, then I consider myself ready to focus on raising Childe alone.\n\nI intend to build Childe for his unique skills as an enabler (though I might make him main dps some day, he seems very fun to play). Plan to use him in a vape or electro-charged comp.\n\nWith that said, I plan to use R4 stringless as his weapon and go for an EM/crit focused build. What level of investment (in terms of talents and stats) would be reasonable for his teammates and himself?\n\nEdit: It seems that I have misunderstood the role of an enabler, so I'll decide on using a rust (main dps enabler) or stringless (burst subdps) while coming up with a team comp. Thank you for all of your ideas!"

I couldn't farm for her fully because I'm a new player building two teams for abyss, but I have been in the dragonspine domain for more than a month since I could use the blizzard strayer set for others. Since Ayaka's banner, I'm at 52 pity, 50/50 and have more than enough wishes to guarantee her. I have materials to level her to 80/80, talents 7/7/7 as I have planned. \n\nNow, for artifact farming, I don't plan to min-max her but I want to get decent pieces for her because I want to treat her well. Over multiple weeks of farming, I struggled to get hp% substat rolls so I have resorted to use 3 off-pieces until I could get on-set upgrades. I understand that better pieces will come with time, but I'm curious how do the comrades motivate themselves when artifact farming goes sour?\n\nHere are the current artifacts I have planned for Kokomi: [https://imgur.com/a/ImHwtNq](https://imgur.com/a/ImHwtNq)"

I'll try to give some clues as to the different letters I might be, without telling you the main ways others type me and how I type myself. \n\n-Seeks to develop deep relationships with those around me rather than shallow ones\n-I would rather be myself than conform to society\n-Others tend to perceive me as being very disorganized because I have a very messy room and never show up to places earlier.\n-I always have a plan in my head and I never miss deadlines.\n-I am able to give a large amount of attention to many different external occurrences at once. \n-I am an extremely hard worker (fast food) to the point of being uptight and having no chill. \n-I prefer to live and let live. \n- I have a high interest in philosophy and disciplines which thrive on abstract thought. When reading a text, I never pick up on the mundane details, only the big picture. \n-I won't remember or can't understand details and facts without a framework or big picture. \n-I'm pretty chill and would prefer to be lazy and chat with my friends than go out and do something exciting. \n-My mind is extremely logical to the point where I can convince someone of anything. \n-I never have a deeply engrained sense of what I \"believe\": Everything is based on conviction or rationality. \n-However, I have a high sense of justice and fairness and seek to facilitate cooperation between people who are struggling to get along.\n-I don't have any enemies. \n-Others describe me as: the crackhead, the debater, an introvert, antisocial, smart.\n-I have never felt like I fit into society. \n\nType me? \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01"

My good friend and I like to watch YouTube videos and play games together quite a bit, but with all of the Covid-19 I've been dealing with throughout the last few months (especially in the last few weeks), playing games is the only thing I can do to hang out with my friends. My closest friend and I love playing Rust together, but he and I have both been watching DayZ videos on Youtube recently, and together we have really started to like the game and its environment.\n\nMy friend and I have wanted to play this game for quite some time, since around September, but due to Covid-19 its effects on my household, I'm not able to afford it anymore. He has recently gotten it (through a gift card from his relative) and wants to wait on me to start playing the game because we got into it together by watching YouTube videos and I feel awful about having him wait on me, but he's adamant on it being fine for him to wait until I'm able to play to start. I would really appreciate it to any that consider it, and please, wear your masks and stay safe! [My Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/lolcringebaby/)"

I'll be taking an OOP programming class that's in Java and since my programming skills were rusty, I decided to spend the summer attempting to self-learn Python and Java to catch back up.\n\nThis week, I started working on Project Euler problems (didn't get very far). The first problem asks to sum up the natural numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5 up to 1000.\n\nMy first instinct on this problem was to use an iterative method in python that asks for user input for the upper limit of the sum so that I could use any value of n like so:\n\n`n = int(input(\"Enter your number: \"))`\n\n`natural_numbers = range(n)`\n\n`sum = 0`\n\n`for i in natural_numbers:`\n\n   `if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:`\n\n`sum += i`\n\n`print(sum)`\n\nSo my question is this: What would be the advantages or disadvantages of using this type of method over a direct method? I'm vaguely familiar with the concept of time complexity as while I haven't taken data structures yet, I have looked into it a bit. Does a direct method cut down on the total amount of operations needed?"

Here is a [link](https://imgur.com/a/14x8wZF) to the problem and my work on it.\n\nI figured that it would be solved similarly to finding Col(A) where you assign each column vector and then find linear combinations of the columns with the free variables given in the rref(A) before using the new linear combinations to find the vectors of the original matrix.\n\nThe issue that I've run into however is that whenever I substitute back into the original matrix with the vectors found by the combinations, I keep getting a different rref(A) which I checked on MatLab as well. \n\nAny ideas where I'm going wrong with this?"

For each major grade ( elementary school, high school, bachelor's degree, master's degree, Ph.D.) There is a national university entrance test that determines which universities we can study in. I messed up on the high school test and did even worse on the bachelor's degree test. So I decided I'd study hard on the master's test ( that was before I knew I had ADHD). While studying I realized I couldn't focus, plan, memorize, or do anything else that was necessary. I did awful on that test too but I managed to get into Tehran university ( one of the best in the country ) just because I managed to answer all English questions correctly ( for context, I got -6 in electronics which is my main subject ). That was around 6 months ago. In the first semester, I failed one class, barely passed another, and finished with an average of 14/20. Throughout the semester I constantly felt like I didn't belong; well truth is I didn't. Most students here did amazingly on their entrance exam, I only got in cuz I could speak English. They made plans, did extra work, and studied daily and I couldn't do any of those things. Now I know why we need entrance exams. They make sure only people who can survive in that environment get in. I would have never applied for this universality if I knew what was needed of me. If you don't get into UF, don't be sad; because even if you did get in, in that situation, you wouldn't survive it. We have to accept that we have limitations. And those limitations will stop us from doing many things. You want it, believe me, I know. I want to be where I am so badly but some things are not for everyone. A blind person can not become an artist; a disabled person can not run a Marathon. There are some things we can't do. It's not fair but life seldom is. Try your best, I hope that you get in and do wonderful things but if you're not accepted, accept that it's not meant to be.",

He rushed to the door on his left and opened it with a sudden but controlled motion.on the other side was a fairly large room with portraits on the wall , red and gold wallpapers, two big windows that looked over the city and a big conference table in the middle. The room was empty of people; in fact it looked as though no one had come in there for several days. The lights off , the chairs were unorganized, not a single heater seemed to be working. Patrick walked around the table and stopped at one of the chairs at the end of the table. Then he put his jacket on the table, fixed his tie and pull up a small card out of his right pocket.  \"Mr Patrick J Bannerman\" was written on the card. He smiled and attached the card to his shirt. Anxiously, he started pacing around the table. He wondered if he got the date wrong or the meeting has changed location without his knowledge. He didn't know that the unofficial start time was 8:30 , an hour after the official time. He wasn't to blame ofcource , after all it was his first time in the council of idiots.\nWhat happened next?\n\n\nRules: there are no rules. New characters can come and go as you please.

So far he has learned some new words without the ability to make sentences with them nor understand sentences containing those words. He doesn't have the time nor the patience to take a class but he loves it when we listen to music or watch a tv series and I translate it for him so I thought maybe this would be a good way for him to improve his listening skill. I got him extr@ but after watching it I realised it's abit too advanced for him. Do you guys know any video series ( or full on English learning packages) for beginners?\n\nThanks you all."

Since there are a a hole lot of different configurations , here are the specs of legion series I'm interested in :\n\n\nA: Lenovo Legion 7 R9000K 5900HX RTX3080 O.C.

I hope to use the laptop as my main pc for gaming and 3d art station. I also run some cpu heavy games and programs ( photonic simulations ) and I worry that the high temps could significantly reduced its lifespan. Also I live somewhere that doesn't have access to lenovo support so if something happens to the laptop , the chances of getting it fixed are minimal. Thank you all"

                "body": "Background: I (26F) met him (30M) back in 2015 when he was on vacation here. He was born in Germany but moved to the UK at a young age, and grew up there (in the North West region, if that helps). We were long-distance until 2019 when he moved to America to be with me. I was born and raised in America - Northern Virginia (NOVA) in Fairfax County, to be specific. The most I\u2019ve moved is between zip codes but I have never left the county I was born in.\n\nCurrently: Living with my (26F) mother to save money. We do not pay rent but assist with utilities and help around the house. \n\nJobs/Salary: Business Analyst + Finance Analyst. Our combined income is 110k. My job (I believe) can be done remotely, while his cannot be done remotely. We would definitely find new jobs before moving if needed.\n\nWhat We Don\u2019t Like About Where We Are: \n\n* COL. We are not making nearly enough money to comfortably put a down payment on any house. While we looked at the housing market in the past year or so, and even went under contract a few times, it just isn\u2019t financially wise at this time. We are lucky to be able to live rent-free and have saved up money for the past 3 years, but it\u2019s still not enough yet.\n* Lack of Walkability: While we currently live in an area that has a small strip mall within walking distance (<.5 mile), we still are car-dependent for basically everything else. For me, this is currently okay, but for my husband, it\u2019s more of a dealbreaker because he\u2019s only grown up in walkable cities. I know it\u2019ll be hard to find that \u201ctown center\u201d/walking to everything concept that is in Europe, but that would be ideal. If not, whatever is close will work too. He has stated multiple times that the suburbs are way too isolating.\n* Too Career-Driven: I always thought I was a workaholic, but sometimes it feels like people here take it to the extreme. I do admit it took my husband pointing it out for me to notice - even I grew up thinking school & career are the only things worth caring about. However, the \u201crat race\u201d is a little bit exhausting. We feel like we can\u2019t make friends - especially him since he\u2019s used to making friends pretty easily in Europe. It\u2019s more common to have casual acquaintances. I have a small friend circle that I am currently satisfied with, but my husband has been struggling a bit.\n\nWhat We Like About Where We Are:\n\n* Limited Walkability: Even though it is a struggle, we know that even being able to walk to anything comfortably in America isn\u2019t always possible. So we\u2019d at least like a place that isn\u2019t *worse* for walkability.\n* Close to My Family: This is the biggest thing since my mom\u2019s side is pretty much entirely in NOVA. As much as I\u2019d love to stay in NOVA, the COL is the primary factor driving me insane. To be honest, if NOVA were cheaper and slightly less career-driven, that would be absolute perfection for *me*, but my husband\u2019s needs also matter, and I would be happier if we were both happy. \n* Job Market: In general, the NOVA area is a pretty hot market when it comes to jobs, especially for government/contracting roles. This is just my personal experience, but I haven\u2019t had an issue finding a job (aside from the 3-month period where I was job hunting after getting my undergrad degree).\n\nNeeds & Wants (in order of priority)\n\n* Cheaper COL. Since NOVA is pretty expensive, this won\u2019t be too difficult to manage, I think. We definitely want to avoid the few places in the US that are more expensive.\n* Somewhat Walkable/Good Public Transport. Again, we don\u2019t need Europe levels, but anything close to that would be neat. The Metro in DC is not too bad imo - I took it daily for work back in 2018. So something at that level or better. For the record, I do have a car and a license, but for the most part, driving gives me anxiety and I only like driving on big empty roads. If my current commute wasn't twenty-five minutes and once a week, I'd probably go insane. \n* \u201cFour Seasons\u201d Weather: I prefer four distinct seasons, my husband is not too fussy. However, he has stated that he hates how hot Virginia summers are, so going further South might not be the greatest option.\n* Good Job Market: This one doesn\u2019t matter as much if we are doing remote jobs, but it is nice to have.\n* Close To Family: I wish I could stay in NOVA, but unless we both double our salaries, I don\u2019t see that happening. So I\u2019d at least like to stay on the East Coast or Midwest unless it\u2019s California (some of my dad\u2019s side is in San Jose). I\u2019m a very family-oriented person. \n* Good Schools: We currently do not have any kids but might have one in the future, so this is just thinking ahead for the future.\n\nWhere are some places we should look into?\n\nSo far, we've looked into moving into the neighboring county of Prince William County, VA, which is an improvement somewhat in terms of cost and Manassas seems pretty walkable near Old Town, but other than that we haven't explored more. I will say if I had to move *right now,* with the knowledge/experience I've got, I\u2019d move to Boston in a heartbeat if it were cheaper haha. We're just curious if there's anywhere else we should take a look at! Thanks :)"

                "body": "Hello! I was born and raised in the United States (Northern Virginia to be specific) and my husband is from the UK but has lived in Slovakia before and we are in the early years of marriage. We met in 2015, got married in 2019, and he has been living with me (and my mother, for money-saving purposes) in Virginia ever since.\n\nHe's super homesick and misses the European style of living in a town, not being work-focused, and being able to see friends more organically instead of planning every single outing to the nth detail. His main complaints about Northern Virginia/USA are: it's too snobby/people talk down to him, the food is unhealthy/he has gained weight, too car-centric, everyone identifies themselves by their job, healthcare sucks (he is currently employed but panics about losing his insurance). Also, the housing is WAY too expensive and we can't see ourselves having kids here. It doesn't help that he doesn't even want to attempt to make friends, yet complaints about having no social life.\n\nRegardless, he has made the decision to move to Germany. He was actually born in Germany but moved at a young age (<1 year old) to the UK (specifically England). He's been to Germany a few times ever since, to visit family/go on vacation. He is not fluent in German, but knows enough to get by and would learn the language on a professional level. He says that I wouldn't have to go with him, but then that means inevitable divorce. He has German citizenship and is in the process of renewing his passport now that the embassy is accepting appointments.\n\nI am risk-averse, sheltered, and quite frankly a bit scared. I've never lived away from my family, and haven't even moved states. I don't know any German (I would definitely try to learn some) and have trouble making friends. I have a couple of friends right now but in general, my social anxiety gets in the way. I'm also a little uptight/elitist/career-focused so I am afraid that might deter people since German culture is different - I am working on it, I promise. However, I do want to give things a try because I am afraid I will regret not trying, I do not want to give up on us, and Germany does seem like it could be good for me.\n\nI am currently in grad school for my Master's program in the US, and am currently working a full-time remote job. I would likely need to resign from my job, as I don't think my company would allow me to work outside of the CONUS. However, since the move is definitely happening, my whole world has shifted and I want to be more ready to move. I am in love with the idea of traveling, but settling down in a totally different country is something else entirely.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Should I focus on making his life as good as it can be before we move, or should I only focus on getting ready/mentally adjusting for our eventual move? I'm trying to take us out on various outings to see the sights here and also trying to introduce him to people here (especially some Germans that have moved to the US who can speak about both countries!). I'm afraid I'm wasting his time, but I just want him to be a little happier here too.\n2. Is there anything I can do to alleviate my fears/stress about things going wrong? I am thinking of doing more research on life in Germany but don't know where to start.\n\nAny other advice would be super appreciated!! Thank you for reading :)"

Kim\u2019s is way less risky but also less result .. if you don\u2019t get where you want with kims you\u2019re either stuck with it or risking Thomas\u2019s surgery after the fact that you now have a bit of scar tissue.\n\nIt\u2019s dysphoria vs risk vs cost.  Cost was never a factor for me.  I wanted the best surgeons because it\u2019s your voice.  However even with the best it\u2019s still an uncomfortable risk.  If I had ended up where I used to be again after a unsuccessful/ partially successful but not enough Yeson procedure I would have done surgical laser tightening with Thomas .. NOT feminization larygoplasty.\n\nMy feeling based on my experience is if you do do feminization larygoplasty do it as a first surgery and ignore that the rules allow you to drink coffee and alchohol and use your voice sooner\u2026don\u2019t!\n\nThat\u2019s the best advice I got..I wouldnt go to other folks personally.\n\nAlso decide if you really need it and only proceed if the benefits outweigh the risk..",

I do have a breathy voice.  In person along with the fact I mostly pass no one is able to tell.  I still get sir\u2019ed on the phone when not trying.  I can\u2019t do further office procedures because apparently in attributes to the gap so I have to go back into surgery to try and stitch the gap close.  So it\u2019s still an unknown for me.  \n\nIf I were to do it again I wouldn\u2019t have done the larygoplasty since I had already had yeson\u2019s done.  I would have done surgical laser tightening which would probably raised my pitch but not had the effect or risk or loss of range and volume.\n\nIt\u2019s still to early to tell, even if it\u2019s been a year because the underlying gap is not closed.  It\u2019s a risk to close it too .. so voice stuff is stressful and not simple at all.  I wouldn\u2019t go to anyone but Thomas or Kim.  But the gap was probably caused by the two surgeries one after the other. Also thomas has lax recovery instructions which I followed but I kind of which I followed Yesons strict regimen after Thomas\u2019s surgery..maybe maybe maybe .. but who knows.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering how much upper range I lost I can\u2019t sing happy birthday.  So.. a lot.\n\nAs an aside the hoarseness after surgery definitely gets better everytime but it is scary as hell every time.  I\u2019ve gone between sounding like Batman and the gingerbread man or Pinocchio from shrek 2 and it is a stress of will I sound like this forever..I don\u2019t..it goes back everytime and I am in the androgynous ranges now or low female ranges.  My resonance is still male\u2019ish so I get people confused on phone calls on how to gender me..they usually pick sir and apologize after I correct them.\n\nYou can only get so much from voice. It is and has always been my biggest dysphoria.",

Enough trans women claim to have them that I am confused or maybe I am not. \n\nMenstruation is the regular discharge of blood and mucosal tissue from the inner lining of the uterus through the vagina. The menstrual cycle is characterized by the rise and fall of hormones. Menstruation is triggered by falling progesterone levels and is a sign that pregnancy has not occurred.\n\nThis isn\u2019t possible with trans women EXCEPT for the rise or fall of hormones.  Maybe some also have some of the secondary systems possibly associated with this like cramping and bloating.  Perhaps with a cycle.  \n\nOn implanted pellets I have never had a mood swing.  So this to me means that the rise and follow of hormones and feeling like there is a regular schedule to have a \u201cperiod\u201d is simply non-ideal hormone treatment.  To me, ideal means consistent always steady levels.  I don\u2019t want to mirror cis women because I don\u2019t want those crappy effects.  I realize some trans women may consider ideal mirroring cis women; we\u2019ll agree that I don\u2019t have to understand why someone would want to feel terrible once a month.\n\nThis understanding has to come from support that other trans women on long steady estradiol do not have \u201cperiods\u201d I.e. emotional and monthly physical transformations like cramping bloating while on implanted estradiol\u2026I did get this way (especially the mood part on other hormones before implants)\n\n..so is that the case?  How are other women here who are undergoing estradiol implants who have steady state estrogen.  Do you feel like you have periods?\n\nDo you need progesterone to have the effect? Did your symptoms go away with implanted pellets?\n\nIf one has zeroed out their FSH and LH but not on implanted pellets do you still feel the effects?"

I am not able to slowly push down the pedal to get a slow speed initially.  \nI have no idea how to control the speed on this. Ive been doing it barefoot.

I even bought cats from other users that had the henna attribute to see if I could increase my chances. I also did the same with the amur attribute. Now that I log in today to check on my kitties, those attributes are completely gone from their list.\n\nI even remember seeing another user who managed to have one of his cats obtain the henna attribute physically, and when I went back to check, that attribute is completely gone. That user is left with a blank cat. The colors of my cats have also changed. I had purple/blueish cat, and now its grey. I had a minty colored cat and now its dark green. Unfortunately, I do not have pictures of before and afters of all of my cats to show the difference. But I hope that this will suffice in letting you understand what I am talking about. \n\nBefore:\nhttps://imgur.com/wExtTIh\n\nAfter:\nhttps://imgur.com/06BjAHn\n\nFrankly, I think is unfair for cryptokitties to make these changes without notifying their users. Some of the actions that were made were based on potentially breeding rare cats. Some users managed to do so and now that has been taken away from them. Had people not spend eth trying to breed these kitties Im sure I wouldnt be upset. But a lot of people have, and changing these things without notification is disrespectful. \n\nI have noticed that the physical characteristics of each cat better matches their cattributes listed, but it still is disappointing to see that some attributes that I specifically bought certain cats for are completely removed."

Two days ago, though, I went to another dentist (this one is specialized in aesthetic treatments) and she said it's not that necessary in my case because it's very slight. I'm saying all this so you can have an idea about the dimension of the problem: it's there, but it's small enough that professionals disagree about the need for surgery or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWas anyone here in the same situation?

                "body": "1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?\n\nNo. I've had several dogs and now I have one dog, a male dalmatian.\n\n2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?\n\nBreeder.\n\n3) Describe your ideal dog.\n\nA happy, full of energy breed that loves people, the outdoors and other dogs. A dog who is really emotionally attached to its owner, I love velcro dogs haha. It would be nice to be good for kids too, I don't have children but since I'm 33, there's a good chance that I'll be a mother while this dog still lives.\n\n4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\n\nMedium-large dogs with a lot of stamina like weimaraners, siberian huskies, irish setters, vizslas. And, of course, a dalmatian. Wouldn't mind a second one.\n\n5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?\n\nI always play with my dog and teach him little tricks now and then. He'll be trained in basic obedience soon (actually he only needs to learn how to heel, he is already good about the rest of the commands), and I intend to do the same for dog #2.\n\nCare Commitments\n\n6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?\n\nPretty much all my free time. I work at a full time job though.\n\n7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your \ndog regularly and does that include using a dog park?\n\n1-2 hours of regular walks during the week, dog parks at the weekends. \n\n8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\n\nI would prefer a short-coated breed since I don't have much time for grooming. But I do give baths and clean his ears myself, and will do the same for dog #2.\n\nPersonal Preferences\n\n9) What size dog are you looking for?\n\nMedium to large. \n\n10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?\n\nI have a dalmatian, so I don't care about shedding. lol\nBarking would be a problem because of the neighborhood. Slobber is a no-no.\n\n11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?\n\nNot very important. It would be nice but I don't really care about it.\n\nDog Personality and Behavior\n\n12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?\n\nSnuggly\n\n13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that\u2019s more eager-to-please?\n\nA little bit of both.\n\n14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?\n\nFriendly but not OVERLY friendly.\n\n15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?\n\nNo dog is perfect, nor is a child and people accept them as they come. Yes.\n\n16) Are there any other behaviors you can\u2019t deal with or want to avoid?\n\nNot in particular.\n\nLifestyle\n\n17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?\n\nWork days, 8 hours a day. Not actually alone since dog #1 will be there, though. But I do everything in my free time with dog #1 - travel, go to restaurants, visit relatives, et cetera. So will dog #2.\n\n18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?\n\nI live alone.\n\n19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?\n\nAs I said, my 1 year old male dalmatian that is leash-reactive but loves other dogs when unleashed.\n\n20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?\n\nNot right now, but it is possible in the future.\n\n21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?\n\nI rent, there's no restriction. But I'll probably move in a few months. Dog #1 will come with me and so will dog #2, and I'll find a home for us whatever the cost.\n\n22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?\n\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil. No breeds banned as far as I know.\n\n23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?\n\n[Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from 65\u00b0F to 88\u00b0F and is rarely below 61\u00b0F or above 95\u00b0F.](https://weatherspark.com/y/30563/Average-Weather-in-Rio-de-Janeiro-Brazil). Summer can be pretty hot and humid.\n\nAdditional Information and Questions\n\n24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.\n\nN/A\n\n25) Feel free to ask any questions below.\n\nN/A"

I think this one is important to me because I'm *exactly* like her.\n\nI suffer from CPTSD. And I'm 99% that Eugenia suffers from it too. For those of you who don't know, CPTSD is not an official diagnosis (yet), but it pretty much can described as \"bad childhood and all its consequences\".\n\nThere's an awesome book about it, \"Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving\" by Pete Walker (I highly recommend this book to anyone with mental problems and bad childhood). And among other things, the author describes different trauma responses.\n\nOne of them is \"fawn\". Deep fear of rejection, deep fear of coming off as rude/hurting someone, people pleasing, inability to say \"no\", nice and friendly behavior because you don't want to offend anyone... You know, all the good stuff.\n\nI'll take myself as an example. I have a YouTube channel. What is it like? Well, I have this very cute online persona who talks in a fake cute UwU voice. I hold back my laughter so it won't be too loud. I cut out the moments of sighs and coughs. I never talk about bad things. If I talk to someone, I make it ABSOLUTELY CRYSTAL CLEAR that I'm friendly and don't want to hurt you because I'm *that* afraid of provoking them. And I can't express any emotion behind \"UwU happy!!!\".\n\nSounds familiar, right?\n\nWhat I wanted to say is... I really hope to see Eugenia's real emotions someday. Like with that diaper accident \u2014 I understand she was hurt, and that's sad, but I'm happy that she could finally stand up for herself. She called her audience annoying and stupid \u2014 and I'm happy because she finally *said what she actually wanted to say*. Notice how she immidiately turned off the stream. She's uncomfortable to show her feelings.\n\nI really hope to hear her actual voice, and see her get mad and say \"f*ck you\" to someone, or see her cry. Because all these are *healthy, normal human emotions*, and *SHE HAS A RIGHT ON THEM*. SHE HAS A RIGHT TO BE MAD, OR SAD, OR AFRAID.\n\nAnyway, please don't criticize Eugenia for her fake voice, or phrases like \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" and so on. Many people think that it's being hypocritical, or fake, or anything else. But I'm 99% sure that it's a trauma response.\n\nEugenia, if you happen to find this post for any reason, please, *please*, at least look more into CPTSD. I know I'm just a random no one to you and I don't know anything about your life, but at least give it a chance. Or at least read the book. This stuff is eye-opening.\n\nThat's all I wanted to say."

As in, if there could be a medieval europe, or some other setting where you're playing in a brand new world. The lore and setting is cool but after over a hundred hours in it, a change of scenery would be awesome. I am not very familiar with Kenshi modding, let alone the map end of things so I'm curious if such a thing would be feasible, at least in theory. If nothing else, could the meshes and other assets at least get changed so I could see snow, or grasslands or something besides sand?

The thing is, the levels are close enough that a level 10 character can maybe beat a level 13, if lucky, smart, and or in the right circumstances (Also, it's almost all PVP in our setting). \n\nMy question is how much power growth happens from level to level? would a level 10 stand any chance against a level 12 or 14? I know AC can go WAY higher in pathfinder which is a partial concern of mine since combat would be little fun if characters can only really be evenly matched with people of their level and literally can't do anything against higher leveled characters."

It should be more than enough for everything I need now and in the foreseeable future. I am also thinking of going for an i5 12400K if I need to cut back\n\n* Gigabyte Z690 ATX DDR4 motherboard\n\nNeed a motherboard that has 1700 socket support and it seems like a good value one. \n\n* G.Skill Trident Z 32 GB DDR4 4400\n\nBit iffy on this one. I definitely want 32 GB upgrade as I'm running 16 GB now and it has been my main bottleneck, funny enough. Originally wanted DDR5 but not sure if it's worth price hike, at the moment and I might not need it until my next build when it will hopefully be better and cheaper. Also, not sure how much speed I need. Would 4400 be overkill?\n\n* Intel 670 1TB SSD\n\nA SSD storage. Would like to get another if budget allows\n\n* RTX 3070Ti or 6700XT\n\nVERY iffy on this. Also, it really depends on the best RTX 3070+ card I can get anywhere close to MSRP. Also, I'm wondering if I should just wait for the 4000 series as the Lovelace architecture is rumored to be a decent bit more powerful. I'm also thinking I can get a big enough PSU and get a 3070+ card now and get a 4000 when it releases and give the 3070+ card to my sister as hand me down (What I do with all my old builds, since I don't want them to feel the financial pain of this hobby lol)\n\n* Aresgame 80+ 850w PSU\n\nSeems very affordable and would allow for RTX 4000 upgrade in the future, hopefully.\n\n* Not sure on case. Just any case that has good airflow and looks nice\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy budget it 2000-2500. I think this fits that budget, as long as I can get a decent deal on a GPU (Actually somewhat possible as there were 830-870$ RTX 3070ti card yesterday and a 600$ 6700XT).\n\nMy Biggest concern is the GPU and then the RAM, to a lesser extent.

RAM has been the main bottleneck for my current build with DDR4 16GB ram, and it's only going to get more intense with the 3D modelling, animation and game development I want to work on. Is the i5 a good multi-tasking CPU? Ideally, I should be able to play games, listen to music and have internet tabs open, without too much issue, at least sometimes.\n\nAlso, any advice on getting the best price for parts?

It is what determines what things are and why they are in the way they are (and not in another way). The All or the Law is the foundation of the cosmos, and determines the forces that shape the cosmos, including us. \"The other\" has the same foundation as I do, and is determined by the same thing and forces that made me the way I am, and not differently.\n\nThere is no objective meaning in this world. We are the ones who determine value and meaning in this world, and we are the ones who project it to the world. We don't percieve things as they are, the input sensory data of your senses do not represent things as they are; they distort reality. The way we percieve the world is a representation, electroquimical impulses processed by your brain. We are the shapers of meaning, and the shapers of ourselves and our character. Character is developed by habits, our habits  are founded on our core  beliefs and ideas about the world, and about ourselves.\n\nWe don't have any type of control on things that do not depend on us in this deterministic universe, but we can control our beliefs, our values, and our behaviour. The future and the past are illusions, only the present, or the moment which you are experimenting is real. Affirm life and promote a vital mode of existance. Carpe Diem, memento Mori. Live wisely, don't be a fool, have courage, enjoy things and experience, but with moderation. Develop your character and a growth and expanding mindset, transcend yourself. Be mindful on how you spend the present, because it becomes your fate and determines who you will become. You are you and your circumstances, a deep interrelationship between entities and their environment that mutually shape and determine each other. The multiplicity of the kosmos is founded in the laws that determine why things behave and are as they are."

My biggest question is this: when exactly do I switch to incorrect answers? I read somewhere that I have to \u201cselect correct answers through the Day 9 branch point\u201d, but I\u2019m not sure what this means.\nWhat I\u2019ve been doing is selecting bad answers throughout Day 9, so that might be why I keep on heading towards the normal/good ending? The first time I tried to go for the 3rd bad story end was when I selected bad answers after the game branch in Day 8 and selected bad answers in Day 9 and 10 (the chats before the game branch), and I ended up getting the \u201cWaiting to Hear From Them\u201d chat.

(Explanation in gameplay mechanics.)\n\nNotable gameplay mechanics: I remember a part in a Let\u2019s Play video when the boy shines his flashlight at a really dark silhouette of a spider, and said spider silhouette turns into a spider (same size as the silhouette, of course) that has cute eyes and Candy all over it. The sky in the middle of the flashlight light is pink, I think. It has a fantasy-like background.\n\nOther details: This is all I remember seeing when watching a gameplay video of the game.\n\nSorry if there\u2019s not a lot of details. It\u2019s been at least 4 years since I\u2019ve watched the beginning of the Let\u2019s Play video for that game, so I can\u2019t remember a lot of the details."

What would probably really help you is to go review your replay of this game, really look at the state of the whole map that you may not have noticed while you were in game, and ask yourself questions about macro strategy rather than just your kda or gold lead.

I noticed it in a sale for Steam's Golden Week for around $26, which I just have enough to buy putting together all my change, but after reading around a bit on this subreddit, it seems that the consensus is that I should play Replicant first. The problem is, Replicant is not on sale, and I do not have $80 to buy it right now. So, my question is, how important is it to play Replicant first? Should I start saving to buy Replicant and skip the sale, or could I get away with playing Automata first and it won't make that much of an impact?"

And while I still totally enjoyed the show (my 2nd time seeing it actually, as I saw it in Kansas City in August), something seemed....off? The cast just seemed to have really low energy, didn't project much, and kinda seemed like they were going through the motions with their lines and songs. The thing is, I like this new cast (Veronica Stern, Willem Butler) but since the first time I saw it had the 1st tour casting (Kyla Stone, Sam Mclellan) it's hard to tell if it's just them or an off-day. Almost everyone in the cast seemed off though. So just wondering if anyone else went to that show and noticed, or if you've seen the new cast in a different city and what your thoughts were?"

                "body": "For all my life, as long as I can remember, I've had this recurring dream theme centered around toilets that can't be used for very weird reasons - never because they're dirty or broken like I hear from other people, but because their layout is so weird that if I used them, I would be exposed in some way. The situation I'm in changes from dream to dream but the idea of a weird toilet is always there and me spending way too much time trying to figure it out that I wake up before I even got to do what appeared to be the main purpose of the dream when it first began.\n\nIt usually always starts with me wanting to do something else but telling someone \"I just need to use the bathroom first\". Once, it was before an exam at school and another time it was before I went into the pool at a country club (I had to change into a swimsuit first and when I change, I usually always pee). But when I get to the toilet, there is always a problem.\n\nMost of the time, it's that the layout of the toilet or the door of the toilet has so many holes in it (almost like a jigsaw puzzle) that if I tried to pee, someone outside the stall would be able to see. The bathroom is always either really full or completely empty. One time, all three walls of the stall were just a bunch of rectangular holes and it freaked me out so much. \n\nThis is the true recurring theme of the dreams: I'm always worried I'm going to be exposed or people will be able to see me naked because the damn toilets are NEVER normal. This usually results in me trying to find a way to use the bathroom so I can have some privacy but it takes soooo long that I wake up before I can do what I originally wanted to (I never sat for the exam and I never got to go swimming)\n\nBut sometimes, the script changes. For example, in the dream about going to sit an exam, I started off wandering around looking for the bathroom. I even went through a supermarket (that randomly popped up in the school) looking for the bathroom and had a whole other dream plot before I finally found the bathroom. When I got to it, it was huugeee. Like a whole two story spa. And there were toilets for \"little girls\" and \"women\". The \"little girls\" toilets were tiny so I had to use the women's ones. But for some reason I couldn't open any of the doors to the stalls even though all but one was vacant. So an old lady comes out of one of them and I ask her how to unlock the doors and she tells me to unlock a stall you had to first fuck yourself with a dildo. It was sooo strange. I had never done anything like that before (I'm 15) so obviously I failed to and I never got to use the bathroom. The dream ended with me trying to jam a dildo into myself??\n\nThere's also another one where I went to use the bathroom during a family function and ended up having sex with three grown men under the staircase to the toilet - bizarre right?\n\nThere's so many other variations of this dream but it's always so frustrating that I can never use the bathroom in my dreams. Whenever there is a toilet I get a little anxious because of it. I've never been able to use one. There's always some weird catch to do with me being naked/exposed or having sex/doing something sexual. I hope I can figure this out someday but for now, it perplexes me."

I would really like to make more girl friends but idk how or idk what I'm doing wrong. \n\nThere were two girls in my past who I really liked and wanted to be friends with but both of them basically ghosted me. One, I kind of know why since she's a christian and found out I'm an atheist. But the other, I'm not sure why. We talked almost every day for like a year and then one day she never responded. It always makes me sad when this happens, but I just move on. Another girl I thought I really clicked with but she takes weeks to respond so idk if we can really develop the relationship.\n\nThere's a few cool girls I reached out to from my class but they don't really seem to want to take it any further so I'm lost. I have a lot of girl acquaintances in my class but they're mostly people who I think I could only ever be acquaintances with. We don't really have a lot to talk about outside of school and a few interests.\n\nSo is there something I'm doing wrong? Is it a bad thing for me to have more guy friends than girls? I'm worried someone might think I'm a pick me or a guy I'm interested in might take it the wrong way.

I feel like, while my story isn't as bad as a few that have I have seen here, there's an essencial element of distrust in my relationship with my mom. I do not feel like I have a loving bond with her. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around her, because if I dont meet her expectations, she will go insane and insult me, saying some of the worst things you can imagine.\n\nI'm very much afraid of her. And I feel like I don't love her. How can I love someone I don't trust??\n\nI recently had a chat with my dad, a sweet and loving person. They were together for the longest time, but now they are separated for many reasons, with the biggest and most destructible one being that she cheated on him. What baffles me is that, even after seeing first-hand how much of a problematic individual she can be, he still has some apreciation for her. I feel like, even though they've been NC for two years because of an incident in 2018, he still has hopes of having a civil relationship because they've been huge parts of their respective lives, even though my mom doesnt want to acknowledge that. They've been together for longer that I've been alive, so I think that's normal, even though I'm probably too young to fully understand it. I just kind of feel like, because of her role in his life and because they haven't talked in two years, he sees her with rose-colored glasses.\n\nAnyway, I've always made my interest in going NC with my mom very clear to him. And he always says that I should, despite her faults, try to mantain a connection with her, because \"one does not so easily get rid of their parents\". He thinks that I'm going to become bitter and have a crappy life because of it. I feel like, even though he disagrees with this direction I might take, he wants to see me happy, so I listen to him.\n\nBut the thing he said that really got me thinking, and I think that is the central piece of this post, was \"she's not that terrible of a mom, is she? She cooks for you, she buys you clothes... She loves you. She's showing you love.\"\n\nI'm very conflicted. On one side, there's a part of me that says \"so what? It's her obligation and responsaility as a parent. She shouldn't be applauded by this. I'm certainly thankful for those things, but I see them as basic requirements of her role.\"\n\nThere's also that other side of me that thinks \"yeah, she does those things, she is a nice and caring person. Not every mom is a nice and caring person. Maybe I'm being too hard on her. Maybe I even owe her something.\" Everything is just so mixed and confusing.\n\nNot too long ago, a redditor responded to another post of mine saying \"abusive people are not abusive 100% of the time, otherwise no one would be around them. They are abusive when they don't feel like they have to put on a mask anymore\". That really stuck with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess the point of this post is asking: \"If a parent meets his basic requirements, should you have them in your life, even though they affect you in a negative way emotionally?\"\n\nOne thing that I keep asking myself is: does she love me? Does she REALLY loves me, or does she do all these things because she feels like it's her job? Would a loving mother cosntantly use these actions as excuses to abuse you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it love if your mom feeds you, but is manipulative and systematically lies to you?\n\nIs it love if your mom buys you clothes, but you can't disagree with her on certain things without having her scream and destroy stuff?\n\nIs it love if your mom keeps a roof over your head, but she pretends to kill herself and then says you're the reason why?\n\nI'm coming to the conclusion that maybe IT IS love, but it's more of a TWISTED form of love. When you really love, you do certain things without expecting to get anything in return. You respect boundaries and let the other person do her own life, because their happiness comes before yours. When you disagree, you try to communicate in a way that doesn't hurt anybody.\n\nAll of this is even more justified for parental love, which is supposed to be the purest form of love there is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading this, I already feel better. I'd love to hear what you think.  :)"

I quickly realised problem with drivers for synaptics device. It was hidden and had yellow triangle, so i tried to install driver from internet. Without any luck i deleted it and uninstalled the driver. Now when i try to install it again, it says that there is no synaptics device. Any tips on how to get to work my touchpad?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I solved it. Recently I realised that trackpoint will work without touchpad connected to the motherboard. I quickly run across thinkpad forums and read about touchpad cable socket being too loose. The solution is to tape few layers of duct tape to the back of the cable and put it into the socket."

After comparing my pet Roc and Black Pudding it seems that \"special attacks\" may be affected more by the mana and/or attack stat(s), and I'm not sure how else the intelligence stat may factor in. Are there certain special moves which use intelligence? \n\n\n **2.** Does the player's speed affect the battle queue when only using \"Pet\" actions in battle? If I had a very high player speed and a very low pet speed how may I expect that pet to function against an opponent with a more regular speed stat?\n\n\n**3.** Under, Main Menu>Collection>Monsters, the monster stats are currently being shown to me as, \"(Stats at level 10)\". Does the level for the stats of the monsters update to reflect the players level?  If not, can I expect the stat distribution to remain at a consistent ratio at higher levels for every monster as it is given for their lvl 10 selves? \n\nFeedback would be great to help me optimize my current run which utilizes pets, thanks!\n\n**Archison**:  Some small bugs: \n\n I did notice a small bug where, after dungeon crawling(could've been at the level up, not sure), my lvl 14 Black Pudding had all of it's stats reverted to 1/3 of their intended value. I'm not sure of the specific circumstances that led to that. I was able to fix it by raising it to lvl 15 with lower leveled enemies, so it wasn't too bad! Also, I noticed that sometimes while farming wood/grinding for my Blacksmith rank, it would occasionally spawn 2 trees per tile or my inventory would temporarily increase by 7 slots (I didn't mind that! Lol). \n\n*Also*: You made an amazing game and I can tell you are a great Dev just by all of your work, patches, and input for posts like this. Honestly, thank you, retain that passion!"

I'm not out to a lot of people so I really wanna talk about her. I figured yall might enjoy our little romance story :)\n\nwe've gone on six dates so far. stuff like hiking, coffee in a park, making dinner together... all stuff we can safely do during the covid era. she makes me really happy :) I've never clicked with a girl I've met online so quickly. mbti is my guilty pleasure, so for those of you who are familiar, I'm an INTP and she's an ENFJ and it works really well\n\nshe has the most intoxicating laugh. she's really good at making me feel comfortable, and that's something I'm really grateful for. \n\nlong story short, I'm planning on asking her to be my girlfriend tomorrow. we have another date planned: picnic by the river. I have bread and cheese and those tiny pickles and a box of capri-suns. I'm really excited and nervous but overall I'm just so so happy :) I was so lonely before she came along and now, (hopefully), I have a companion <3"

                "body": "TLDR: I'm a girl who really likes the thought of being a boy but I can't tell if that's just internalized misogyny\n\nI've been thinking so much about gender lately, and since gender expression has historically been a big part of lesbian communities, I figured these thoughts might fit here.\n\ncurrently, I identify as a cis woman and a lesbian. I've never had any dysphoria regarding being perceived as female, I've never had any trouble with people using she/her pronouns, etc. however, lately I've found myself thinking about what it would be like to be perceived as male.\n\nit started when I started thinking about pronouns. I've got a friend who uses they/them, and another friend who uses she/they, and I obviously respect and acknowledge their genders and pronouns. but when it comes to myself, I find that I really don't care about pronouns at all. I truly think it would make no difference to me if someone referred to me as she/he/they or anything else.\n\nbut when I truly try to imagine (as realistically as possible) someone using \"he\" to refer to me, I feel so good. it's this type of elation I can't describe. the same thing happens when one of my guy friends unironically calls me \"dude,\" \"man,\" or \"bro.\" I just feel so powerful, like I've been accepted as one of the boys. \n\nI also find myself identifying with some of the stereotypically \"masculine\" behaviors (blatant stereotypes that do not represent men as a whole). for example, for some reason I got the idea a long time ago that I would physically fight someone in the name of protecting my wife. I would lose for sure, because I have a small stature and zero fighting experience, but I've found it's something I would definitely do in the moment. it gives me really good feelings to think about entering a physical altercation for the sake of my hypothetical wife (which sounds really silly but it's true).\n\nthe trouble is, I'm really afraid all of this is only because of some internalized misogyny I have. why else would being referred to as a man make me feel \"powerful?\" that feels gross.\n\nI don't know. I'm 20 years old so I don't know why this stuff is surfacing just now. even though I feel like I present pretty androgynous, I know people see me as female, which again, doesn't give me any discomfort. I'm gonna continue identifying as a woman for the time being, just because doing anything else wouldn't really change anything about how I live my life. I just figured I'd vent a little and see if any of you have had similar experiences."

My parents were the kind of parents who thought you could force yourself out of a depression through sheer mental power or that if you have ADHD, you \u201cjust need to focus more.\u201d So I never took seriously the thought of getting help for ADHD because my parents never thought I had it. I have a suspicion that both my mom and brother have it, PI and PH respectively.  Even after talking with my parents about making an appointment for possible ADHD two weeks ago, my mom was in a sort of denial about it and said \u201cyou don\u2019t have it, you were a normal kid.\u201d I think I understand what her thoughts are about it though\u2014seeking help for mental wellbeing is still stigmatized in her home country. But now that I\u2019m 28, it feels like a relief to be diagnosed\u2014all these years I just thought it was \u201cnormal\u201d that I was struggling with focusing and paying attention and thinking that other people were going through the same thing as me but that they were just better at everything else than I was. I feel like I have a better shot at just functioning. Anyway, thank you for reading about my progress today! I feel like this will be a very important step in my life and wanted to share it with you all."

My assumption would be that market research shows creamier-looking ice cream sells better.\n\nAnd yeah, shared machinery was a big concern for me at first.

My heart broke when I saw it!\n\nI\u2019ve tried baking soda baths with Vaseline all over his face and scalp immediately after getting him out of the bath, and adding a humidifier by his bassinet at night. It seems to help for a day or two but then he\u2019ll get another bad flare up. We\u2019ve even had to put mittens on his hands at night to keep him from scratching up his little face. Kid looks like he lost a fight with a bird if we forget the mittens!\n\nHas anyone found relief by switching formulas? I read online that hypoallergenic formula can sometimes help.\n\nETA: He\u2019s been on Enfamil Enspire Gentlease since he was 3 weeks old. He does also have reflux and gassiness, but it\u2019s better and manageable with the Enspire. Most of the time he is a happy, content baby.
