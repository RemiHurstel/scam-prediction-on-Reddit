Always be looking for things you can get ahead on if you have free time. Getting behind on studying/homework will cause a lot more stress than is necessary to get the work done.\n\nFor your social life, get involved in EVERYTHING you're even a little interested in. You can always drop a club or leave an event if you don't like it, but the chance of meeting people you'll really get along with makes it worth it to get out of your comfort zone! Talk to everyone. Even if you feel awkward, be outgoing, be curious about other people. Recognize that everyone is in the same shoes you're in.\n\nHonestly, if you liked the way high school was for you, try to find things and people that were similar to that environment. The only thing that's super different in college is you have a lot more freedom to shape your life. Best wishes!",

Every month or two, I\u2019ll get a small painful spot on a similar place on my vulva, and I\u2019ve been assuming they\u2019ve been outbreaks. It\u2019s just frustrating because they don\u2019t seem very similar to the lesions experienced by most other ghsv1+ people. \n\nThey usually are very hard to see, if not impossible to. They never produce a noticeable amount of fluid or scab up. And usually, I don\u2019t get prodrome symptoms so I have no idea they\u2019re coming until they become painful. I\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to have sex with my partner before I notice one of these outbreaks. The only thing that makes me confident that they\u2019re hsv outbreaks is because they cause a similar pain to my initial outbreak.\n\nDoes anyone experience something similar or have advice? I\u2019m already taking antivirals daily. I just don\u2019t want to be so in the dark with this virus."

Now that I'm aware of this, I really want to change it, but I have no idea how.\n\nI'm very much a people pleaser, and this is magnified with people that I especially like/want attention from. Someone being unpleased with me leaves me devastated and feeling horrible about myself. This need is almost crippling at this point, and it almost feels like it's too ingrained in me to fix. I've tried to just tell myself \"You don't need attention from men to be valued,\" but once I get lonely or my self-worth is lacking, I revert back to the old mindset.\n\nHowever, for my well-being, I'm willing to do what I can to change this, but I don't know how. I'm so tired of the cycle of giving men all I can, expecting them to like me, then never getting a call back. I want to feel complete without having a man pursue me. Can any women who've overcome this give me advice?"

Now, unemployment isn\u2019t the only metric in success for policy, quality of life also, later the misery index, and public good- i think- all justify FDR\u2019s New Deal. Had I been a voter in 1932, I almost certainly would\u2019ve voted FDR instead of Hoover, because the prior years with Hoover at the helm did not provide *nearly* enough relief to the people.

I've been watching and reading some content about this game (MOON: Remix RPG Adventure) and i really like its vibe, it has a surreal thing going on it that kinda feel like EarthBound. The game inspired Undertale with its satire take on the genre; you play in a world where you have to fix all the mess the hero of it has done, the first RPG to do something different like this. The mix of paper-like characters drawn with crayons in a detailed 3D rendered world with some random clay texts and figures make the game feel otherworldly, added with the deeply experimental soundtrack (which is a huge plus for me in any game) and the sound effects and characters speech, makes the game feel otherworldly, almost - ney, completely - dreamlike, and i feel really tied to this kind of media. It really resonate with my soul.\n\nThe thing is: the game costs about 40 bucks where i live (which is quite a lot already), i'm a college student (i study Linguistics for whom it may interest) and i'm currently unemployed, working a few nights in bars as a freelancer bartender, so i'm using my money only for essential things, so i'm not really doing much besides studying and chilling at home, and playing some videogames sometimes.\n\nIt would really make my following days if whoever is willing to gift me it do so :-) i'd have nothing to say other than thank you, thank you very much.\n\nSteam account:  https://steamcommunity.com/id/infernosatanas/ \n\nGame page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1714580/moon\\_Remix\\_RPG\\_Adventure/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1714580/moon_Remix_RPG_Adventure/)"

My choice of college was dictated by my strengths, because there wasn't anything I wanted for myself. The only two girlfriends I had started giving me obvious signs, so there wasn't any initiative on my part on that front either. Despite feeling like I couldn't fit in with most other people, I've never been able to make myself the center of attraction for others, instead choosing to just passively befriend anyone whom I already know and who can tolerate me. I can't even choose my own clothes: even the notion of responsibility for my choices leaves me paralyzed. \n\nI can't live like this any longer. At this rate, I feel like I'll just be swallowed by life, surrendering to whatever external entity will control me. I want to be the master of my fate and the captain of my soul.

My mother is a good woman, but her mental state is very frail: having to constantly do homework with my sisters (I got two of them) while getting them to develop their hobbies exhausted her nervous system, she is now very easily irritated and sometimes screams at us in a feat of impotent rage. This morning she received an information that my sister tried smoking \u2013 she told her a lot of awful things (I can't love you no matter what, you do not deserve it, you are rotten in your core, if you commit crime I'll be the first one to call the police), after which she has started crying about how her life is wasted, how she sacrificed it for her kids to grow up as egoistic pieces of shit, she said feels pain all over her body and that she wants to kill herself (being rather superstitious, she would never say things like that lightly). On the other hand, I know my sister to be kind in heart, but very apathetic and gullible. She doesn't want to study, she is always distracted, her friends manipulate her and use her all the time.

Our friendship haven't survived this as well which for some reason felt even more devastating. The thing is, even though I've been in a rough place for some time after, general, I feel pretty good. I have a direction in life, I love the thing I study for and I love the feeling of being alive. However, that is not the same when my mind returns to my time together with her. I felt so happy that every good side of my life bleaks.

She also goes in the same university as I do and I've doomed to stumble upon her from time to time. This is maddening and I've no idea what to do with that.

It means they are subjected to having the same less-hectic, uneventful life as I have and I'm not alone in experiencing something for once. But with our country's success with Covid-19, locations are slowly starting to open up again. (which is a nice thing btw!

I sigh, defeated, and thought 'at least they are doing a good job social distancing there'.\n\nIt should've been just that.

It's all genuine bliss and the reality that I'm going to have to face.\n\nLol what a massive punch the gut. I'm jealous that they have a life with friends and people while I don't. I have no friends.

But dude it's not like I could lie on bed and instantly fall asleep when I just woke up 4 hours ago.\n\n\n\nAnyone have suggestions to how to fix this? I'll be here to hear suggestions since I really need to start breaking this habit ASAP.\n\nP.s. Make sure to Q U A R A N T I N E fellas!"

Been on this dosage schedule since 2016 and it's worked well. Very well even though endos say it's a bit high for my height and weight.\n\nHowever I got a new Endo recently who recommended me skip my noon dose of 5mg HC and just take a morning and evening dose. The new regimen she has me on totals 20mg per day. Except now I'm noticing my skin darkening, developing a tan unrelated to sun exposure. Before I was diagnosed, this was a noticeable change in me signalling low cortisol. \n\nWhat could be happening? It's only a difference of 2.5mg Cortisol throughout the day...is that enough to start darkening my skin again? Should I go back to the 22.5mg total, 3 times per day?\n\nThank you."

                "body": "I've been seeing many posts about how to get a significant other or manifesting love and people's frustrations with their inability to do so successfully. I'm sure it works at some level and people have seen success from doing the traditional methods to manifest someone say by visualizing someone with, perhaps a specific colour hair, personality trait etc. which is all well and good, but why is it so hard to manifest a feeling from someone else, external to you? Herein, in my mind, lies the problem. \n\n**Many are trying to manifest love from a space of lacking and deficiency.** When you focus on your need to acquire a person from whom to receive love and putting your energy into that, you're telling the Universe that your own produced self-love and love for others is deficient and that you depend upon drawing energy from other entities and circumstances to be in a positive vibrational state. When you base your vibrational frequency on x event happening, or acquring y person, it is a conditional circumstance: effectively you are then broadcasting the message to existence that \"in order to be happy and content, complete and appreciated, I must be able to control the thoughts, emotions, feelings of another human being so that they fit within my own expectations\". And of course, we can't control others. We only have domain over our own consciousness and its interactions with the world around us. When we are trying to manifest specific existing human beings (such as exes) it's even more challenging, because they are a being with their own desires and free-will. \n\nI propose we start by asking ourselves: What is it within me that so craves this love, from this external source, in the first place? Why do I want to manifest love in the first place? Is it because I am lonely and require validation from someone? Is it to feel appreciated? To feel loved and to love?\n\n**What I've found works best is to focus on self-love and loving all things in your current reality, then your soul-mate and external love we all seek will manifest.**  Of course we are all social creatures and need to love and be loved, but we need to start focusing more on what brings us happiness and love from within, getting to know our own selves and souls. It will then be much easier-- by being fueled by our own self-love and unconditional self-acceptance--to love others, love the world around us and those within it, and do so by doing acts of good and whatever makes us feel good on this earth. It is only then when that special kind of external love from another will undoubtedly flow effortlessly back to you three-fold when you are in that space and frequency of openness. Can't love if you don't love yourself.\n\nBlah blah blah work on yourself etc. as they say. Super clich\u00e9 right? Yet as we all know, there's truth in most clich\u00e9s and they are clich\u00e9s for a reason. The most important relationship in life, I believe, is the one with yourself, and as you are the Universe itself, your relationship with the Universe. Mastering LoA is mastery of your own thoughts and actions and beliefs etc. We always discuss 'alignment' - but alignment with what? Alignment with desires? Other people's love? I think the key with feeling aligned is being aligned with your own soul's purpose and your inherent values, skills and gifts, irrespective of anyone else. \n\nIn LoA, it's said that if you're not vibrationally in the space of happiness and contentment or other positive frequency, you can't possibly manifest your desires. Thus, **if you aren't happy 'alone' (read as: appreciating and revelling in the absolute inherent God-given value of your own soul), you will never derive contentment and love from the acquisition of any material thing, event, circumstance or person.**\n\nObviously easier said than done, but my advice to those struggling would be to consider furthering your self-explorations and seeking by looking deep within and getting to know yourself and all your unique gifts, talents, scars, warts, dark places, virtues and loving every inch (physical, spiritual, mental...) of yourself not only despite these qualities, but because of all that makes you, you. This is all very challenging, but nothing good comes easy and remember that you are on a journey. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\nEdit: formatting."

I wasn't sure when to use the needle after vomiting twice (and not being able to keep my meds down). I waited more than 2 hours after vomiting to take my needle (BIG mistake).\n\nWhen I got to the ER at the hospital, after injecting (HALF) of the 100mg that comes in the Solu-cortef (it was injected wrong), I waited another 4 hours to be triaged in this shit health care system in Canada. That's right, full blown Addisonian crisis and I was close to the bottom of the triage list.\n\nI had developed chills, excruciating stomach pains, was vomiting, had back and leg pain, and was wailing in pain for hours on end and didn't care who heard me. I knew I was dying and the feeling of helplessness of it all has really stuck with me and I'm finding it to be a lot to process even now (just a few days later). Knowing I just need cortisol, but not getting the treatment I needed in time. I even screamed to one of the doctors \"I'm DYING man, PLEASE help me.\"\n\nFinally, I was seen and given the life-saving hydrocortisone and they put me on hydromorphone for the pain.\n\nWhat I'm saying is...please do not wait to get treatment if you vomit (or experience any other severe stress). Do NOT hesitate to use your emergency injector - it's actually not that hard to use provide you follow the basic instructions. If someone else is telling you to wait for whatever reason, TAKE MATTERS INTO YOUR OWN HANDS and inject it yourself, if you are able to.\n\nFrom now on I'm going to carry my needle at all times. I never carried it with me anywhere, but luckily that night I happened to be at home where I had my needle. If I was out, I'd probably be dead. I think another key thing is keeping a letter from your endocrinologist in your wallet that explains your situation and how you need IMMEDIATE medical attention - waiting around in an Emergency room is NOT an option.\n\nI just needed this post to vent as I don't have anyone in my life that can understand, and also share some warnings because I didn't take my illness seriously before this, but it escalates very quickly and if you can help it, don't ever let yourself get into this type of situation - be prepared because you don't know when you can get sick or hurt.

Despite external circumstances, such as having few friends and other things I'd ideally like to change in my life, for the past year I've been happier and more at peace than ever! This has been truly very nice because I got really sick before this happened and then finally found out what was wrong with me, then I got better. So for that year after that close call with death, I was just happy to be alive. \n\nBut now, I feel like that's wearing off, as ungrateful as that sounds. I can't help but start to think that if I merely am content with the 'little' things, how will I ever be motivated to seek out a better life? Am I truly fulfilled with my career, relationships and me as a person overall or am I lulling myself into a relaxed state of delusion about my own contentment.\n\nMy question for you all, then, is how do you balance mindfulness with mediocrity. Mindfulness has been a tremendous benefit to my life - but I now fear that I am starting to become complacent and stagnant in my life, when in reality I want to have a career that I love more, I want to come out of my shell and strengthen my relationships and make new ones, I want to travel and learn new things. Where do I get the motivation to do these things, if 'regular' things likely provide me with the same amount of happiness too?\n\nThanks for listening\u2764\ufe0f"

                "body": "I (F21) know how it sounds but hear me out first.\n\nI was hired 3 months ago by a supermarket chain as a cleaner for their offices, situated in this massive building where hundreds of people work everyday. \n\nPart of my job is cleaning toilets. When I clean a toilet, I leave a sign at the door saying the facility is currently being cleaned and asking for people to find another toilet during this time as you can get into another set of toilets within a two minute walk no matter where you are.\n\nMost people respect this sign. Some may not read it (I understand that though, it is not flashy and can go unnoticed) but, as soon as they get in and see a cleaner there, they apologize and get out. Some very rare cases ask to use the toilet, but it is usually just one time.\n\nThis dude was different though. One time he walked in, I said \"Oh sorry, I'm just cleaning here\". \"No problem you can finish it after\". I was a bit shocked with the way he spoke to me but I just walked out because I just didn't feel like dealing with the drama if I that could come with me saying \"no\" to that.\n\nAnother time he got in and, after mine \"Oh sorry, just cleaning\", he said \"I'll be quick\". I was going outside to grab my mop anyway so I just went for it.\n\nThis last time his reply was instead \"hey, gotta pee, get out\". I said \"I'm almost finished anyway, just two minutes\". He told me to leave, I asked him to read the sign please while I finished.\n\nHe said something like \"This is the men's toilets, you're the one staying here so I am going to feel free to pee no matter if you're here or not.\"\n\nWTF.\n\nI walked out while hearing him unzipping his trousers. I was lucky one of my supervisors was close by. Told her quickly a dude was going to pee while I was cleaning the toilet and he was still inside.\n\nHe gets out of the toilet almost immediately, completely relaxed. I point him out to my supervisor. She asks him if he has anything to say about what happened with me inside and he tells her he wanted to use the toilet and that I was gatekeeping it. He was honest about ordering me to leave and about telling me he was going to start peeing even if I was there. He just thought it was fine to say that. He also was honest about starting to unzip his pants while I was still leaving. He just thought that was ok because I was in the wrong.\n\nAnyway... He ended up being fired. It was so weird to see him being so honest. Luckily for me, my work believes that I deserve to tell people not to use toilets while I'm cleaning them, no matter the gender.\n\nI'm feeling a bit shitty about this. I got someone fired when I could have just let him use the freaking toilet. On the other hand, the dude was definitely disrespectful of me and my work.\n\nIf there are any questions about anything, let me know. This situation just escalated very quickly and has left me startled with guilt...\n\nEdit: I wasn't expecting this whole thing. Just to thank everyone for their judgements! I hope you all are having a nice day."

Je m'en fous que tu t'en foutes, comme tu t'en fous que je m'en foute. On partage juste nos visions (oppos\u00e9es) des choses, c'est \"intellectuel\".

C'est une question de contr\u00f4le, pas de responsabilit\u00e9.\n\nA un moment donn\u00e9 tu ne contr\u00f4les pas les agissements d'autrui. Les personnes malveillantes existent. Si tu veux contr\u00f4ler ton destin, il est dans ton int\u00e9r\u00eat de te prot\u00e9ger plut\u00f4t que d'attendre des autres qu'ils soient bienveillants et juste de les punir (question de la responsabilit\u00e9).\n\nC'est pas parce que tu te prot\u00e8ges du mal que tu es responsable du mal. Ce que Jerem47 lui dit par \"sois un homme\" c'est \"d\u00e9fends tes int\u00e9r\u00eats\", \"ne te laisse pas faire\", il le fait juste dans une forme viriliste parce que j'imagine que c'est sa culture et qu'en appeler \u00e0 la fiert\u00e9 masculine d'OP peut \u00eatre un moyen efficace de le r\u00e9veiller.\n\nLe fait que tu te concentres avec une certaine v\u00e9h\u00e9mence sur la forme du message (masculinit\u00e9 toxique) plut\u00f4t que sur le fond et l'objet du message (\"d\u00e9fends toi\") montre juste que tu as un biais qui n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec l'affaire. C'est ce que je voulais souligner avec ma premi\u00e8re r\u00e9ponse. Je vois pas en quoi c'est une question d'intelligence, on a tous des biais???\n\nEncore une fois la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 est s\u00e9par\u00e9e. Ce n'est pas parce qu'il est dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de te prot\u00e9ger que la femme n'est pas responsable et ne doit pas payer. C'est juste que tout un chacun ne peut prendre des d\u00e9cisions que sur ce qui est de son contr\u00f4le et la malveillance d'autrui n'est pas de  notre contr\u00f4le, ce qui est de notre contr\u00f4le c'est l'espace qu'on lui donne en se prot\u00e9geant ou non.\n\nTon approche compassionnelle (il s'agit de minimiser le **sentiment** de culpabilit\u00e9 des victimes en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) a pour effet secondaire de maximiser le nombre de victimes potentielles puisque la question de se prot\u00e9ger du mal est occult\u00e9e car \"culpabilisante\", laissant ainsi un espace maximal au mal pour se d\u00e9velopper.\n\nAutrement dit, ton approche compassionnelle est un des facteurs qui permet au \"mal\" de prolif\u00e9rer (pour parler sch\u00e9matiquement).\n\nLe meilleur moyen de \"prendre soin des victimes\" c'est encore d'\u00e9viter qu'elles le deviennent, ce qui passe par une r\u00e9flexion sur ce que chacun peut faire pour \u00e9viter de devenir une victime.",

J'ai eu la m\u00eame exp\u00e9rience que toi, plusieurs vendeurs tous les 3m.\n\nJe suis m\u00e9tisse, la famille de ma m\u00e8re est de Marrakech. Quand j'\u00e9tais petit, j'allais souvent \u00e0 la place Jemaa el-Fna. Tu peux y trouver plein de vendeurs, des dompteurs de serpents, des voyantes etc...\n\nC'est simple, j'avais l'impression que la place du Trocadero (et les alentours) s'\u00e9tait chang\u00e9e en une Jemaa el-Fna, mais avec beaucoup moins de charme car le contexte est diff\u00e9rent. Autour de la Tour Eiffel, la prolif\u00e9ration de vendeur semble plus hors sol et chaotique, c'est difficile \u00e0 expliquer.\n\nA l'occasion de ce s\u00e9jour \u00e0 Paris, j'ai s\u00e9journ\u00e9 dans un Formule 1 \u00e0 Montreuil, je passais tous les jours dans une rue pour prendre le m\u00e9tro arr\u00eat Robespierre, et bah cette rue l\u00e0, pareil: des vendeurs (pas \u00e0 la sauvette cette fois) \u00e0 gauche \u00e0 droite, des enseignes de magasins en arabe, j'avais l'impression d'\u00eatre sur un autre continent, version plus chaotique et hors sol.\n\nEt c'est pas que Paris. En province, dans ma ville de 125 000 habitants, on a le m\u00eame ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne mais les quartiers sont plus espac\u00e9s. Tu prends telle ligne de bus, tu as une population donn\u00e9e, tu prends un autre tu tombes sur une autre population. \n\nCela ne me semble pas b\u00e9n\u00e9fique que les territoires soient aussi cliv\u00e9s \u00e9thniquement et culturellement. C'est mauvais car c'est une forme de d\u00e9terminisme \u00e9thnique: si les gens de la m\u00eame origine vivent s\u00e9par\u00e9s des autres, culture, moeurs et origine deviennent li\u00e9s entre eux par effet de groupe et de fr\u00e9quentation. En France on est cens\u00e9 pouvoir s'\u00e9manciper de ses origines qui ne doivent pas compter. Quand les gens vivent entre eux, dans leur bulle communautaire, c'est rendu beaucoup plus difficile...\n\nDans ces conditions, du ressentiment se cr\u00e9e d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 (\"on nous assigne \u00e0 r\u00e9sidence sur la base de notre couleur de peaux\", \"on a pas les codes et on est discrimin\u00e9s sur le march\u00e9 de l'emploi\") et du racisme de l'autre (\"ils sont d'une autre culture\" \"on ne peut pas les assimiler\" \"il est arabe/africain donc il a tel trait de caract\u00e8re\").

It works pretty well at stripping flavors and the first things I've tried have been various peppercorns; black pepper, sichuan pepper, and timur berry.\n\nTimur berry in particular has some awesome aromas and flavors (grapefruit) but it also has that characteristic \"soapy\" taste that comes through, which I find undesirable. Most peppers also have this taste, if you chew on the peppercorn directly.\n\nI'm wondering if you folks have any advice on how I could get the good flavors to stay and keep the bad flavors out. The impression it gives me is like when tea is oversteeped; it's stronger, but also has some bitter undesirable flavors. With tea it's easy, you can simply steep it for less time. But it's not that simple for these peppers. Anyone have some knowledge to share?\n\nAny other tips and tricks with homemade bitters would be appreciated too."

Tbh, the math was easier, but I think it's because they put me in a math class I'd already taken due to transfer equivalencies being wacky.   \nOn more subjective assignments like projects and papers, they basically capped it at 75 unless people did like PhD level work as an undergrad, so a 75 would be like a 95 here I'd say.   \n\n\nAll in all, I think the grading schemes end up being equivalent, especially in STEM subjects.

He refuses to wear costumes that he feels don't make him look good. And when rehearsals/gigs aren't going to plan he can have quite a temper, and will often overstep the directors. He also is late to stuff a lot because he sees call times as a \"suggestion\". He's never been late enough to miss a gig, but sometimes it gets pretty close.  \n\n\nI've suggested he change his attitude so he stops getting fired, and he says \"I'm unwilling to do a gig that doesn't make me feel fully comfortable\" or \"I'm unwilling to put more time into this than I have to\".  I grew up doing theatre, whereas he grew up doing band, so I've tried to explain to him that the etiquette is different in theatre, but he dug his heels in. I wondered for a while if maybe he has the right idea. Maybe actors shouldn't just roll over to whatever directors tell them. But I've realized that it literally does not bother me to just do what they say and to show up to things early and to have a good attitude, and if it bothers him, maybe it isn't the right industry for him.",

                "body": "For the past few weeks, I've just constantly wanted to scream, so maybe getting all this out somewhere will help me. I know I should probably use a throwaway but I don't even care.\n\nI (24F) randomly had a dream one night back in January that I was a toddler in this specific hospital in my area, and I was scared, and my parents were acting concerned and worried. It was really weird because it felt super real, like a memory, but I feel like if I was sick as a child, my parents would've told me, so I wrote it off. But if kept nagging at me, so eventually I called my mom to ask her about it. \n\nShe got all weird and was asking me what I remember, and I truly couldn't remember anything except the hospital. And she kept saying stuff like \"I need to discuss it with your dad before I tell you what happened\". She and my dad have been divorced for years, so I told her she doesn't. Finally she told me that due to an emergency, she left me alone with one of my dad's best friends, and when she came back I was walking funny and I told her he was a \"bad man\". She prodded a bit and I told her he touched me. She decided to take me to the hospital to make sure I wasn't injured, and they found physical evidence that I'd been assaulted. Following that day, I apparently forgot really quickly but I couldn't go more than a few minutes without needing to pee for several weeks. For reasons that are unclear to me, even though my parents try to press charges, nothing really happened, and the perpetrator left the state. \n\nFor a while, I didn't really have any feelings about this information. It felt like I heard a story about something else. But I've also had a history of being in sexually and emotionally abusive relationships, I'm terrible at setting boundaries, and I have countless of the textbook traits of someone who was abused as a child, so clearly it impacted me even if I didn't remember. My mom offered to pay for therapy, and I took her up on it because i suffer from several untreated mental illnesses anyway. \n\nWe agreed to not tell my dad that I know, but my mom had to get emergency surgery (she's fine now) and in case she didn't make it, she told my dad that I know what happened and asked him to continue to pay for my therapist. He completely lost it and denied that anything happened in spite of them having discussed it previously. He's a war refugee and saw a lot of extremely traumatic stuff and never processed it, so I think he feels like if he can just ignore all that and be \"fine\" then why can't we just ignore this? But he's also unsupportive of my sexual orientation and was emotionally and physically neglectful of me for most of my childhood, so with all that on top of him just denying that this traumatic thing happened to me, I just never want to see him again.\n\nI also had a nightmare last week that I think revealed some of the circumstances of the incident that I forgot and I haven't been able to get over that nightmare since. \n\nI'm also currently in my hardest semester of school (changed majors several times, so I'm graduating late) and I have 3 part time jobs. It's taking all I can to not put minimum effort into all of it and let my grades slip. I feel so unreasonable because I don't really remember what happened. I just feel like I'm trying to live my life as normal but I have this giant weight on me that I'm carrying alone."

I have no memory of any of these events, and my mom has a tendency to exaggerate things. I do believe some version of this happened because no one would lie about something so awful, but I want the facts of what actually happened, so I want to find evidence that this trial took place.\n\nI'm having problems finding it for several reasons. I don't know when the trial happened. My mom hasn't told me exact dates, and every time I try to get more information, she just starts apologizing to me repeatedly. I know how old I was when he was arrested, so that narrows to a year long period for arrest records. This man also has a really common name, which makes finding anything difficult. I also don't know what jurisdiction handles this sort of crime. So far, I've looked in county court and arrest records in the county where I was living at the time and a few surrounding counties just in case, but I found nothing. I tried looking at state and federal records but I'm finding these difficult to navigate. From what I can tell, I can only look at federal records one month at a time and I have to pay to even see what the court case was about. \n\nBasically, I want advice on finding...something. An arrest record, a court record, a court transcript, anything that proves this actually happened. This advice could be narrowing to a jurisdiction (I'm in the USA) or a good database for court records or good search terms. I know I'm not allowed to post anything that allows for doxxing, so that's why I'm being pretty vague.

I tend to score the same or much lower on my finals compared to my midterms. I have to study for 4-5 of them at a time and they cover the whole semester of content, and for classes where the content isn't all super connected, it can be very difficult to study for. Is there something I'm missing? Am I an outlier in finding finals worse than midterms?

In fact, I never noticed. He had to tell me. It was one of those phones with a fancy camera and he literally took a picture of me and showed me the picture and I was just like \"huh.

Also when you put something in them they make you look weird and when they get wrinkly it's hard to iron them.\n\nBecause of the reasons above, I cut pockets so they become useless, aka \"fake pockets\".\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pbk1dpgxsvv51.jpg?width=1522&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c371257a6d2334481d2fcce4245bc45ae55a5622"

                "body": "Because of the Forbes interview, I've seen a lot of people on this subreddit say that he will, but I have absolutely no idea why. All Noah ever said (in this interview, in Vogue and on his live) is that Will's arc wraps up beautifully and that the show is coming full circle. This probably means (in what I understand) that Will is going to be important again in s5 and that he'll play a major role in defeating Vecna. On the other hand, the Duffers have confirmed that s5 will contain his coming of age arc, both personal and supernatural. Now think about it: what kind of message that would send for a gay kid's (who suffered for 4 seasons btw) coming of age to end in death just so that the straight characters could live? Why would Noah call this kind of ending beautiful, when he clearly expressed in previous interviews and panels that he loves his character and wants him to have a happy ending?\n\nAnd there are many other reasons why Will dying would not make any sense. For example, it will make s1 and 2 completely pointless, since both of these seasons were about saving Will. You could say that they did something like this with Prim in Hunger Games but the thing is, stranger things is tonally completely different. Killing off a character like that in this show would not send any interesting message and would definitely kill the rewatchability for many people. On top of that, Will has been miserable for four seasons straight, what makes people think that killing him off is a beautiful way to end is arc?? Also, the Duffers are smarter than to do the \"bury your gays\" trope lol\n\nWhat I think would happen is that, in s5, the supernatural plot and Will's sexuality arc will intersect and that he'll finally stand up for himself. He's going to be crucial to defeating Vecna, and I think that these two will have a confrontation. I've also seen theorised that Will is gonna have some sort of powers in s5 (not necessarily like El's), but I'm still not sure about that (could be cool tho, especially for the \"Willel wonder twins\" thing). I also think that he'll come out to the Party and his family, and that they will all be accepting. While I don't think he'll get a boyfriend in s5 (unfortuanately. I really hate how the Duffers wrote him into a corner like that), I imagine that the season will end on a hopeful note for him, that he won't be single forever and that he'll find love too.\n\nIn any case, Will dying does not make any narrative sense and I have no idea how people came to that conclusion. It would be an extremely cruel and lowkey homophobic way to end his arc. Obviously yall are entitled to your opinions and I'm not saying that my theories are 1000% correct. I'm just putting out my arguments for something I think will not happen in s5. You're allowed to disagree with me and to start a healthy discussion."

You will have side effects for 2 weeks at least and these side effects in my case included (headaches, upset stomach, mood swings, dizziness, very tiredness, very intense anxiety, and less motivation) these are the ones that I experienced it's a bit unpleasant to experience. Still, it's tolerable and with some painkillers, you can manage it...You take 25mg I take 50 so maybe you will have milder side effects. After 2 weeks, your side effects will decrease a lot you won't really notice it but the depressive mood is still there and the waking up difficulty is still there. My anxiety decreased a lot I almost cried from the happiness that after 18 years with anxiety 24/7, I'm able to function and be calm...In the fourth week, it will work wonders I'm completing a month now and omg I can smile, and laugh I'm in a good mood most days...I'm having good days more often now after 2 years of struggling with depression. I feel a bit good about myself for the 1st time and I'm also more motivated well I'm still depressed and I have crying spells but I'm really grateful for what I have now.

                "created_utc": 1672183257.0,
                "body": "I\u2019m a 24 year old male. I\u2019m an only child, and was raised by a single mother (dad left my mom when she became pregnant with me and manipulated his entire family so that they either would not interact with me or know of my existence). Thanksgiving of last year, my paternal grandmother (dad\u2019s mom) called me to her house for a family reunion which is where I met the majority of my dad\u2019s family for the first time. \n\nMy father\u2019s family comprises of two parents, four kids (one girl, who is the oldest, and three boys, including my dad, who is the second boy), and four grandkids (including me). My aunt has two kids, my older uncle has zero, I may be my father\u2019s only child (more info later), and my younger uncle has one kid. \n\nMy older uncle, who I met at the reunion, fortunately is a good and honest person and wants to have a relationship with me. He was very candid about the manipulation and collusion happening in the family. \n\nHe mentioned my aunt has a hidden agenda against me. She is a practicing lawyer and is the designated power of attorney for a generation skipping trust my paternal grandfather created years ago right before his death. His dying wish was for me to be inducted into the family and for me to receive an equal portion of the trust. It seems that my aunt doesn\u2019t want this to happen. \n\nI have interacted with all members of the family except my father - he\u2019s continued to actively avoid me and seems to want nothing to do with me (he is going through a divorce right now so maybe that\u2019s why? Or maybe he has other kids he\u2019s lied about to everyone as well? Or probably because of shame? Idk, he\u2019s always been a mischievous person\u2026). \n\nIt\u2019s clear from body language and word choice that my biological aunt and younger uncle\u2019s wife are also keeping some distance from me (ex: they refuse to take pictures with me and will use fluffy language to obscure some details like \u201coh you know we love you, but [insert lame dishonest excuse for mistreatment here]\u201d).\n\nMy paternal grandmother, the person who invited me, is currently 93 years old and is quite frail (basically a vegetable that relies on caretakers 24/7). She\u2019s emotionally and physically dependent on my aunt and father, who have manipulated her for years so that she has very limited contact with me. She has mentioned nothing about the trust to me (I\u2019m not even sure if she remembers there is a trust at this point, her short-term and long-term memory are both faltering at this point). \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what my options are at this point. One option is to wait until my grandmother or dad passes away (my older uncle suspects he has pancreatic cancer but he has kept it under the radar and that has at most three years left to live). Then there may be some more information revealed about the trust. I don\u2019t like this option though. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if my uncle\u2019s other siblings are aware I know of the trust and the collusion occurring behind the scenes. I haven\u2019t told them anything and they haven\u2019t asked me.\n\nOne thing for sure, it has crushed my mental health. I had one negative interaction with my aunt a month ago where I was at my grandmother\u2019s house and she called the house and aggressively told me to leave. I\u2019ve also been intentionally uninvited to most celebrations occurring at my grandmother\u2019s house, including my father\u2019s birthday and this past Thanksgiving and Christmas. I\u2019m tempted to pick up the phone and confront my aunt on her behavior and tell her to put my name on the trust, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a good idea. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m a 24 year old M. I came into contact with my dad\u2019s side of the family last year for the first time in my life. My dad\u2019s older brother, who is childless, informed me that their family has a generations skipping trust my name is supposed to be on. My dad\u2019s older sister is a practicing lawyer and is the power of attorney for this trust. She and my father have actively obstructed contact between me and their family.\n\nP.S.: I know this story sounds crazy, I honestly wish I wasn\u2019t involved in this at all. I\u2019ve been in therapy this whole year to cope with the effects.  At this point, I\u2019m just grateful to be alive and a normal human being, nothing more, nothing less. I honestly just want my dad\u2019s family to come together as intended at least one time, no conflict, no BS, but that\u2019s unlikely going to happen."

I\u2019ve been able to consistently fall asleep at around 10:45 PM and wake up at 7:30 AM using these methods.\n\n**My strategy**\n\nI only need my phone for four things at night: \n\n1) Generic sleep music that helps me fall asleep \n2) Morning alarm \n3) Taking notes/setting reminders \n4) Finding something interesting to read \n\nI covered (1) and (2) by buying an Amazon Echo Dot (with clock), a.k.a. Alexa. I only use Alexa to set morning alarms and stream calm music from Amazon music (comes with Amazon prime), but it works very well.\n\nI covered (3) by having some pens and journals next to me. If I have an idea or past memory I need to get off my mind, I can do a brain-dump right there on paper.\n\nFor (4), I use a Kindle and have one paperback book next to me that I can reread (it\u2019s more of a daily guidance book with tips for each day). Kindle is great because it has a warm light that doesn\u2019t wake the brain up at night when being used.\n\nI still sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, but I\u2019m able to fall back asleep within 20 minutes by drinking some water, replaying some music, and reading a book or using the Kindle. I don\u2019t touch my phone at all when doing this.\n\n*It doesn\u2019t matter what you use to substitute your phone, the point is that if you can avoid picking up your phone at night (except for real emergencies), you\u2019ll be fine.*"

Yes they could.\n\nAnd yeah, they could use the same boats for shallow rivers and the like, their boats were lighter than Viking boats, and it's a huge part of Maori culture using those Waka for water transport throughout New Zealand's many rivers\n\nSo yeah, considering they sailed from the sunken continenent of Zealandia, across the largest ocean in the world that covers 1/3 of the globe, and arrived at the south American continent, I'd say yeah they spanned continents too.",

Am I consider someone who \"knows programming \" ?\n\nExamples of code I can  write include things like implementation of  numerical methods, implementation of algorithms involving graphs and data structures, some basic object oriented programming, data analysis.\n\nI'm not good at remembering syntax off the top of my head however, so i pretty much forgot most of the syntax and functions (except python, in which i implemented my graduation project).\n\nI've also taken SQL at university, but I totally suck at it.\n\nIs it reasonable to say I can code , and to list coding as a skill in my resume ?"

However, the idea to use this property would have never crossed my mind so I solved it as follows, please point out whether this proof is correct or not : \n\nAssume f is differentiable. We want to prove that f' \\^-1 (- \u221e ,a) is Borel for every a in R i.e {x\u2208R s.t f'(x)<a} is Borel. \n\nWe know that f<g implies F<G where F(resp. G) is the antiderivative of f(resp. g) \n\nusing this fact :  f' \\^-1 (- \u221e ,a) =  {x\u2208R s.t f'(x)<a} = {x\u2208R s.t f(x)<ax+b} where a and b \u2208R (antiderivative of a w.r.t x) \n\nf' \\^-1 (- \u221e ,a)  = {x\u2208R s.t f(x)-ax<b} = g\\^-1 (- \u221e ,b) where : g(x) = f(x) - ax ; a and b are both arbitrary real numbers. since g is borel measurable (sum of f and -ax both borel measurable) therefore g\\^-1 (- \u221e ,b)  = f' \\^-1 (- \u221e ,a) is Borel. \n\nAny help would be appreciated"

Here is what I have so far out of the stop of my head:\n\n* Naruto's rage against Haku\n* Zabuza's rampage in the bridge\n* Rock Lee vs Gaara - \"Guy-sensei, please allow this\" This is so GOOOOLD\n* Sarutobi sealing Orochimaru\n* Naruto vs Sasuke final fight\n\nFeel free to post your favorite or any other I might be missing"

They anticipate that I will define and polish DevOps practises in the infrastructure and development cycle. What I've set out to do is review existing infrastructure and development strategies, then make a list of what's working, what's not working, and anything else they might be lacking... HELP.\n\nThey are a small code development company with about 24 employees and about 10 developers... everything I said above sounds good, but how do I actually do it? I've already mapped out the entire infrastructure, listed the current tools and resources in use and how they're used, but how do I determine whether something needs to be changed? How can I tell if they are deficient in any way? Is there any source of information that I can go to compare what we have to what it should \"ideally\" be? It was so much easier to just be told what was wrong and what to do, haha.\n\nI think that my problem is that I don't have a framework or a vision of what \"DevOps\" should look like. If I did, probably those stuff would be easier for me to see.  \n\n\nEDIT: I am currently reading \"The DevOps Handbook\" to get a more clear mindset, but any empirical input from you guys would be great"

Then going back to rogue Swashbuckler for the rest of the career. Would it be better to first get to Swashbuckler before taking the other level in fighter, or is my current plan better?

                "body": "I have been on Vyvanse 30mg for a few months now and it has meant the world to me. What a difference! However, getting refills has been SUCH a hassle - like to the point that I have wondered if being on this drug is even worth it at all.\n\n1. My psychiatrist only writes 30 day prescriptions, no refills. I have to have an appointment with her every single month to tell her that it is still going well before she will put in another month for me. To be clear, it\u2019s not therapy - she just asks if I\u2019m sleeping and eating ok and stuff like that.\n2. I get a ONE DAY window to get my medicine refilled. Walgreens won\u2019t refill it and insurance won\u2019t cover it until it has been exactly 30 days since my last refill, so I have to pick it up on THE DAY OF my last pill.\n3. If I put in a request to my pharmacy (Walgreen\u2019s) a little ahead - for example, if the day I can pick up Wednesday, so I do a refill request on Monday or Tuesday but clearly state that I will be not be picking up until Wednesday - all it will do is come up with an error. The pharmacy will not touch it at all to make sure it is ready for me on \u201cthe big day,\u201d so if they are out of stock and need to order more, they won\u2019t even find this out until that day rolls around.\n4. If my pharmacy is out of stock, as a controlled drug, they cannot transfer my prescription to be picked up at a different location of the same pharmacy. (CA law I think?) My doctor has to actually cancel it and set up a whole new prescription at a different location. So if it is on the weekend or a holiday, I\u2019m completely fucked. This has happened and now I\u2019m completely paranoid and have to remember to call the pharmacy to find out if they\u2019re in stock and not too low. Which seems like a lot to ask of someone with ADHD if you ask me.\n5. If I DO miss a day or two, it really, really messes me up. This happened when my pharmacy was out of stock on a Saturday, and I was new to all of this, completely unprepared for the hoops and the hassle, and I missed two days. When I got back on, I had high anxiety and irritability and horrific insomnia for about a week. I never had these symptoms when I started in the first place, but the roller coaster of withdrawal and restarting was way too much for my system.\n\nAm I doing something wrong here??? Is this just how it is?? What if I am on vacation when I need a refill, or just can\u2019t get to the pharmacy for a day or two? This is so stressful! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nDo other people have doctors who will eventually trust them with a 90 day prescription and less frequent check-in appointments? Is there a pharmacy out there with a more reliable system for making sure these types of prescriptions are ready to be picked up on the magic day that you are allowed? Or am I destined to continue being treated like a drug-seeking addict every time I seek treatment for my ADHD??? There MUST be an easier way?"

They strongly disagreed and said that if you like the same sex, then you are transgender because a man can only like another man if they are actually a woman. I identify as a sapphic and I\u2019m very confident that I am not a man. But apparently if you like both genders and identify as both a man and a woman, you are nothing but a pervert.

Why would that be?\n\nAt first, I thought this was Sukuna's way of antagonizing a curse, basically making fun of Jogo. If curses are full of nothing but negative emotions, then actually respecting and sympathizing with them should be the best form to unsettle them mentally. And that might be what he was trying to do here, but one thing still makes me believe otherwise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[His face.](https://preview.redd.it/b0ydv2fhtcha1.png?width=321&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aec2129a250617d720f33d1b374687b7d9845779)\n\nIntrospective, in deep thought, maybe even... Confused? While the appearance of Uraume and after that, Mahoraga, shook him out of it, this is the face of someone who might not even know why he just did that. Or maybe, he's remembering something he wanted to forget...\n\nPeople theorized that his soul was fusing with itadori's, but now we know that the story ain't going that way. So what was this scene?\n\nIn my opinion, that was Gege's way of showing that, despite everything, Sukuna is still human deep inside, and maybe, there's something that still matters to him, other than himself. Maybe it was the reason he was able to sympathize with Jogo in the first place. Maybe it's a person, an ideal, a memory of his past, something. A part of his human experience that he was never able to get over. Maybe it's his only weakness.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fq4ohl1lucha1.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3ffa109cb7cb96246b3a9c9956bc315dc9369509"

                "body": " \n\n# Elden Ring Critique\n\n# It\u2019s no Masterpiece\n\nElden Ring is a good game that I found myself unable to enjoy. It might be because of the high expectations I had, but considering the amount of marketing and hype surrounding this game, it\u2019s not unreasonable in the slightest to think it would be the best yet in the souls series. To me, it didn\u2019t come close to topping Dark Souls 1, and is closer to Dark Souls 2 in quality than anything else. Elden Ring lacks originality, and that is quite shocking considering From\u2019s history with new Ip\u2019s. Elden Ring feels WAY MORE like a Dark Souls game than any other, probably even more than Demon\u2019s Souls (never played this one so I don\u2019t know). Let\u2019s first talk about\n\n# Combat\n\nElden Ring\u2019s combat is basically identical to Dark Souls 3\u2019s, changing little to nothing from the original system and even when it does, all the changes are **additive**. Let me explain that by making some comparisons: In Dark Souls 1, the main healing system revolves around Estus Flasks. Those are refilled every bonfire you get to, and you can get more of them by kindling certain bonfires, only those bonfires will give you more Estus than normal. Additionally, you have humanities, which can heal you fully but are harder to find. In Dark Souls 2, however, Estus is **fundamentally** changed. From the way it works mechanically, to the way you aquire them. It now heals you slower, but it (to me at least) seems to heal you more, it also takes more time to drink it. Also, to aquire more of them, you need to find Estus Shards around the world, which **permanently** increase your charges. Additionally, you now have other healing options like life gems and mushrooms, which are not as hard to find as humanitites, thus encouraging the player to use them more. On top of **additive** changes (new healing items), Dark Souls 2 brings **fundamental** changes to DS1\u2019s original system. Which increases the game\u2019s originality, maintaining it fresh.\n\n### Now let\u2019s see what Elden Ring changed from Dark Souls 3\u2019s healing system.\n\nIn Dark Souls 3, you have a system that combines some elements from DS1 and DS2. The healing is back to being faster, and you can now do it while walking. The method to aquire Estus is still the exact same to DS2. However, now you need to allocate your Estus between restoring HP or MP. Furthermore, additional healing items are removed. You only have the ember, which works similarly to DS1\u2019s humanity, but also increases your max HP by 20%. Although if you are already \u201cembered\u201d you can\u2019t use embers again until you die and lose your current ember. In Elden Ring, healing takes the same amount of time as in DS3 and you can also do it while walking. In Elden Ring, you can also allocate your flasks between Crimson(HP) and Cerulean(MP). Additionally, Elden Ring brings rune arcs, which heal you fully and increase your max hp by 10%. Although you can only use another rune arc once you die and lose the current rune arc. Also there are 3 healing expendable consumables. Also Elden Ring brings the wondrous physick, which can heal you if you use certain crystal tears. Elden Ring brings no significative fundamental changes to the original DS3 healing system, and only adds new stuff. If you don\u2019t use consumables a lot in Souls Games, like a lot of players do, you won\u2019t even notice the 3 new healing items, and only see the wondrous physick as an extra healing flask. This goes to show that little to no effort was made to create a new healing system or to introduce new mechanics in that area.\n\n### And it\u2019s not limited to healing.\n\nAshes of War is an addition to the Weapon Art mechanic. It functions the exact same as in DS3 except now you can choose which weapon uses which Weapon Art. You could argue it changes a lot  in a gameplay choice sense, but it brings no new mechanics to the game, it only improves a little a mechanic that already existed. There are probably some other examples I don\u2019t remember but you get the point.\n\n### What about the things it didn\u2019t change?\n\nA lot of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Dodging is exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3, with rolls and backsteps.\n* Heavy Attacks are exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3\n* Backstabs are exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3\n* Parrying and Riposting is exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3. But I must say some bosses take 2 or 3 parries to riposte now, again, an additive change.\n* Blocking works exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3.\n* Staggering enemies works exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3. But they **added** a little indicator to where and when you should riposte a staggered enemy.\n* Equipping and casting spells works **basically** the same as in Dark Souls 3, but the pyromancy type of spell was removed and now there are only Sorceries and Miracles (which are now named incantations).\n* Spell uses work exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3 (MP).\n* Invader NPCs work exactly the same as in Dark Souls.\n* Summoning ally NPCs or players works exactly the same as in Dark Souls.\n* Upgrading your weapon works **basically** the same as in Dark Souls 3. But now it has more kinds of upgrading stones and weapons can reach higher levels.\n* Equip Load works the same as in Dark Souls 3.\n* Talismans work exactly the same as the rings from Dark Souls 3.\n* Leveling up works **basically** the same as in Dark Souls 3.\n* Elden Ring\u2019s character stats work **basically** the same as in Dark Souls 3. With the removal of vitality and changing Luck\u2019s name to Arcane. Luck and Arcane work basically the same but arcane has more utilities.\n\n### That would be fine, if\u2026\n\nThe game was named Dark Souls 4. But it isn\u2019t.\n\nLet\u2019s take Bloodborne as an example, the changes to gameplay are dramatic. The fundamentals of the gameplay are changed, the pacing, your agression towards enemies, the way you think, everything. Elden Ring brings nothing like that. I\u2019ll spare you of listing all the things Bloodborne changes because this isn\u2019t about it. And if you were to look at Sekiro it would be way worse. But I don\u2019t believe it to be a fair comparison because Sekiro is not an Action RPG, it is in another genre of games and is from another publisher.\n\n### What it actually changed.\n\nThey added a Jumping button to the main character movement, which allows for more vertical exploration. This is good, but Jumping is almost never viable in a combat scenario, which is disappointing.\n\nIn regards of combat, we have Block Counters, Crouching Attacks and Revamped Jump Attacks, I\u2019ve only found the last two to be useful, the follow up attack on the Block Counter is way too slow, so most enemies are too fast for it, especially bosses.  Jump Attacks are fun to use and good to stun enemies, I\u2019ve sincerely nothing against it. Although this change would be more welcome in Dark Souls 4 than in another ip completely. Crouching Attacks were my go to move against fast bosses, as I was using Ultra Great Swords, which can be almost useless against the faster enemies, so Crouching Attacks can give you an edge. But it was too easy to abuse, I was able to stunlock a lot of enemies by spamming it.\n\nMy favourite addition was Spirit Summons. There were a lot of them for a bunch of different situations, and I used them as often as I could. I heard some people saying that they didn\u2019t use spirit summons because they treated it the same as summoning another player online or a phantom NPC. But those same people thrash the game because it is \u201ctoo hard\u201d. Most of the game is balanced with the assumption that the player will use spirit summons, and it can be very hard even if you use them. They made a lot of fights more fun for me.\n\n**BUT**\n\n**The Spirit Summons can end up trivializing a lot of the bossfights, especially against one single enemy.**\n\nStealth felt really misused in this game and I got really surprised that it isn\u2019t used as a core mechanic in any bossfight. But I don\u2019t usually like using stealth or stealth focused games anyway so I won\u2019t extend myself here.\n\n# Great Rune and what it could have been.\n\nThe Great Rune mechanic is by far the worst introduced in this game. Not because it is mechanically bad or disfunctional, but because it was wasted.\n\nGreat Runes are supposed to be a big deal, you get them after you fight a big boss, and need to climb a huge tower to even activate them, not to mention needing to have a rune arc active. But all of them are glorified talismans that are applied with your Rune Arc. Not one of them changes anything from a gameplay perspective. Again, it **adds** things. Gives you buffs and special effects. Most of which can be replicated, although in smaller scale, by a talisman or some other item. The alpha name for the game was literally **Great Rune**, and yet Great Runes are more like a side mechanic that kind of help you here and there. They are not obligatory to progress through the game; They do not give you new quests or new endings; They do not expand or improve exploration; They do not expand your combat options; They do not give you access to new areas; They do not change **anything** about your game, **fundamentally speaking.**\n\n### And that is because Elden Ring limits itself by keeping to the Dark Souls Formula.\n\nIt is understandable that by reusing Dark Souls 3 mechanics, they could focus more on the world and levels. But Elden Ring sabotages itself a lot by using mechanics of a game that **isnt meant to be open world**. When you talk about going open world in a series. You need **significant fundamental changes** to the gameplay (Think about Breath of the Wild). And because Elden Ring doesn\u2019t do that, it felt a lot like I was just playing Dark Souls 3 again, but with more content. By the way, **I hate Dark Souls 3.** It\u2019s to the point where Elden Ring seems like a gigantic Dark Souls 3 dlc.\n\nIf Elden Ring\u2019s core mechanics were made and thought out for an open world game, not only combat, but exploration and almost everything in the game would be benefited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The game uses a lot of vertical exploration but the platforming is janky and inconsistent. Not to mention platforming while on horse. Which is even worse.\n* Exploring in Elden Ring consists of walking around open areas in your horse looking for a door hidden somewhere. And they never introduce anything new concerning traversal, movement or exploration. And that is because relevant changes in this part would conflict with the Dark Souls exploration, which normally only has you walking around, opening doors and climbing ladders.\n* A lot of enemies and bosses don\u2019t have apropriate responses for long ranged combat, because in the Dark Souls games, you normally only fight in cramped spaces, where you don\u2019t have a lot of space to run around.\n* The game enables horseback combat, but it is mostly useless or just worse than fighting on foot. Again, because the Dark Souls enemy AI conflicts with a fast moving enemy that keeps increasing and closing the distance between them repeatedly. The horse would need Invincibility frames to be useful for most of the fights, so only a handful of them actually have you use the horse. I remember using it in like 10 fights of the 100+ bosses I\u2019ve fought. I also remember trying to use the horse a lot and failing miserably.\n* Because of how the Dark Souls AI works, they\u2019ve been yet unable to do wandering enemies/encounters right, and they normally just spawn around the same place or very near it.\n* The game begins with a very populated and dense open world, only to drop off that standard immediately, and the next open areas being more populated by bigger closed areas or just having straight up less content (See Mountaintops of the Giants and Caelid).\n\nThis goes to show that they\u2019d be probably better off by just making a new set of gameplay mechanics especifically for Elden Ring.\n\n### Things that were in other games but didn\u2019t make it to Elden Ring:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Transformations: Like becoming a dragon in the Dark Souls series or a beast in Bloodborne, you can never do that in Elden Ring\n* Underwater movement and combat: Was present in sekiro and could\u2019ve been elaborated upon in Elden Ring, also would\u2019ve solved part of the problem with the lack of traversal and exploration mechanics.\n* Covenants: Would\u2019ve added to the story, choices and possible endings of the game, and it felt very weird that a game so based in DS3 wouldn\u2019t have covenants.\n* Firearms: Wouldn\u2019t fit too well in the High Medieval Fantsy theme of the game but something similar to the gun parrying in bloodborne would be nice\n* Trick Weapons: I still don\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t add anything similar to this. Or at least some ashes of war that change the moveset of your weapon, like making your sword larger with magic, just like Moonlight Greatsword in bloodborne.\n\n# Disappointing open world\n\nI had a lot of fun while exploring the open world for the first 20 hours or so, while I was still in Limgrave. But at each area I reached, I was disappointed every time by how the exploration changes so little in the new areas. You walk around, you see a door, or a ruined structure, or a cave. You enter it, you fight some enemies and maybe a boss, and you get a reward. Not a single new mechanic for exploring or discovering is introduced, and considering that most of the content in the game is **recycled**, it\u2019s very easy to get bored. Throughout the whole 120 hours I\u2019ve played Elden Ring, there was only one mean of traversal and I explored every area the exact same way.\n\n### The game does very little to make the world feel dynamic or alive\n\nThe areas felt static and nothing changed while you weren\u2019t watching. It felt a lot like the open world was just a very large Dark Souls level. The same enemies always spawned at the same places and there weren\u2019t enemies or encounters that moved around or changed locations. Lightning bolts always striked at the same set places and things like rains, storms and blizzards happened so rarely or were so indifferent to gameplay that I almost didn\u2019t perceive them.\n\n### Respawning and fast travelling\n\nThe respawning and fast travelling ruin the day-night cycle and weather changes. Every time you fast travel or respawn after dying, it\u2019s daytime and sunny. I basically never got to see some areas at night because the game didn\u2019t allow me to, always booting me to daytime everytime I respawned. Also why add nightime exclusive encounters if you\u2019re going to boot your players to daytime that much? Everytime I died to a DeathBird or to a Night Cavalry I had to sit at the grace, set the time to nighttime, and wait for a loading screen. Thing that pissed me off a little. The huge amount of grace spots also made traversing an area more than once kind of pointless, and made me miss a lot of encounters that don\u2019t appear on the map or things that appear only on night time. Enabling you to fast travel that much seems like an excuse to not think too much about how traversal works in the game. Maybe if I needed to walk around more I wouldn\u2019t have missed as much encounters with NPCs, \u201cWandering\u201d enemies, or caves and dungeons as I did.\n\n### Exploration and Rewards\n\nThe exploration in Elden Ring felt a lot like a chore to me. Every time I got to a new area, I\u2019d take the map for it, then I\u2019d see what were the points of interest in the map, and would go to them, complete them, and get my reward. Over, and over, and over. The same enemies, the same structures, the same dungeons, the same bosses, and 90% of the rewards were useless to my character. Eventually I grew tired of it and I was only exploring the game in hope of finding something fresh or just because of my own sense of completion.  Also, because the encounters in the overworld were so uninspired, offered no real rewards by beating them, and didn\u2019t really stand in my way, I started ignoring every single overworld enemy I could, and ran directly to the dungeons. Doing this made me miss a lot of NPCs and other encounters that stand in the middle of the overworld with no indicator at all.\n\nAlso the reward system absolutely does not work in a game this big. Whatever is the build you\u2019re running, 90% of the items you\u2019ll find will be completely useless to your character. That makes exploration feel even more meaningless and frustrating. In Dark Souls, if you explored an area and got an item you\u2019re not going to use, you lost 20 minutes. Do the same thing in Elden Ring, and you\u2019ve lost 2 hours. Also, considering the amount of spells and incantations the game just throws around as rewards because the developers simply did not know what to put at the end of the dungeon, 60 to 70 hours of my playthrough were just wasted away, considering I only used like 5 incantations throughout the entire game.\n\n## I\u2019m obviously shitting on reused content\n\nElden Ring could be half the size it is, and be twice as fun. About 60 hours into the game, I was tired of my character build, and I played 120 hours with that build. I did try to use incantations to spice it up, some ashes of war, some different physicks, but in the end, I was still using an Ultra Great Sword, and I was still tired of doing the same shit over and over again, with the same build, versus the same enemies.\n\n# Big Dark Souls\n\nElden Ring does no effort at all in being its own thing. The game finds itself unable to step outside of Dark Souls III\u2019s shadow, because that game was successful, and made lots of money. So they did it again, but bigger. And guess what, it worked. This completely steers away from FS design philosophy, and what really makes Dark Souls important as a Video Game. \n\n**Dark Souls had the courage to step out of what was mainstream in its time, and set the foundations for what would become not only a sub-genre, but also an entire sub-culture of video games.** **Bloodborne, Sekiro, God of War, Darksiders, Hollow Knight, Zelda, Code Vein, Nioh, Jedi Fallen Order, Blasphemous, Salt and Sanctuary, and so many more games took so much from Dark Souls\u2019 combat and game design.** **Dark Souls was revolutionary.** \n\nElden Ring might have the largest world, the most fluid combat, the most amount of enemies, the fastest bosses, the most amount of spells, armor, and weapons. But Elden Ring brings so little to the table, that it fails to be an independent IP, and instead hides itself behind the safety of doing again something that had already worked before. Despite being open world, DS3\u2019s stolen mechanics in Elden Ring conflict so much with the bigger map that it rarely felt like open world and only like big dark souls.\n\n**TLDR: Elden Ring bad because too much like Dark Souls 3**"

It might be because of the high expectations I had, but considering the amount of marketing and hype surrounding this game, it\u2019s not unreasonable in the slightest to think it would be the best yet in the souls series. To me, it didn\u2019t come close to topping Dark Souls 1, and is closer to Dark Souls 2 in quality than anything else. Elden Ring lacks originality, and that is quite shocking considering From\u2019s history with new Ip\u2019s. Elden Ring feels WAY MORE like a Dark Souls game than any other, probably even more than Demon\u2019s Souls (never played this one so I don\u2019t know). Let\u2019s first talk about\n\n# Combat\n\nElden Ring\u2019s combat is basically identical to Dark Souls 3\u2019s, changing little to nothing from the original system and even when it does, all the changes are **additive**. Let me explain that by making some comparisons: In Dark Souls 1, the main healing system revolves around Estus Flasks. Those are refilled every bonfire you get to, and you can get more of them by kindling certain bonfires, only those bonfires will give you more Estus than normal. Additionally, you have humanities, which can heal you fully but are harder to find. In Dark Souls 2, however, Estus is **fundamentally** changed. From the way it works mechanically, to the way you aquire them. It now heals you slower, but it (to me at least) seems to heal you more, it also takes more time to drink it. Also, to aquire more of them, you need to find Estus Shards around the world, which **permanently** increase your charges. Additionally, you now have other healing options like life gems and mushrooms, which are not as hard to find as humanitites, thus encouraging the player to use them more. On top of **additive** changes (new healing items), Dark Souls 2 brings **fundamental** changes to DS1\u2019s original system. Which increases the game\u2019s originality, maintaining it fresh.\n\n### Now let\u2019s see what Elden Ring changed from Dark Souls 3\u2019s healing system.\n\nIn Dark Souls 3, you have a system that combines some elements from DS1 and DS2. The healing is back to being faster, and you can now do it while walking. The method to aquire Estus is still the exact same to DS2. However, now you need to allocate your Estus between restoring HP or MP. Furthermore, additional healing items are removed. You only have the ember, which works similarly to DS1\u2019s humanity, but also increases your max HP by 20%. Although if you are already \u201cembered\u201d you can\u2019t use embers again until you die and lose your current ember. In Elden Ring, healing takes the same amount of time as in DS3 and you can also do it while walking. In Elden Ring, you can also allocate your flasks between Crimson(HP) and Cerulean(MP). Additionally, Elden Ring brings rune arcs, which heal you fully and increase your max hp by 10%. Although you can only use another rune arc once you die and lose the current rune arc. Also there are 3 healing expendable consumables. Also Elden Ring brings the wondrous physick, which can heal you if you use certain crystal tears. Elden Ring brings no significative fundamental changes to the original DS3 healing system, and only adds new stuff. If you don\u2019t use consumables a lot in Souls Games, like a lot of players do, you won\u2019t even notice the 3 new healing items, and only see the wondrous physick as an extra healing flask. This goes to show that little to no effort was made to create a new healing system or to introduce new mechanics in that area.\n\n### And it\u2019s not limited to healing.\n\nAshes of War is an addition to the Weapon Art mechanic. It functions the exact same as in DS3 except now you can choose which weapon uses which Weapon Art. You could argue it changes a lot  in a gameplay choice sense, but it brings no new mechanics to the game, it only improves a little a mechanic that already existed. There are probably some other examples I don\u2019t remember but you get the point.\n\n### What about the things it didn\u2019t change?\n\nA lot of them.\n\n* Dodging is exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3, with rolls and backsteps.\n* Heavy Attacks are exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3\n* Backstabs are exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3\n* Parrying and Riposting is exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3. But I must say some bosses take 2 or 3 parries to riposte now, again, an additive change.\n* Blocking works exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3.\n* Staggering enemies works exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3. But they **added** a little indicator to where and when you should riposte a staggered enemy.\n* Equipping and casting spells works **basically** the same as in Dark Souls 3, but the pyromancy type of spell was removed and now there are only Sorceries and Miracles (which are now named incantations).\n* Spell uses work exactly the same as in Dark Souls 3 (MP).\n* Invader NPCs work exactly the same as in Dark Souls.\n* Summoning ally NPCs or players works exactly the same as in Dark Souls.\n* Upgrading your weapon works **basically** the same as in Dark Souls 3. But now it has more kinds of upgrading stones and weapons can reach higher levels.\n* Equip Load works the same as in Dark Souls 3.\n* Talismans work exactly the same as the rings from Dark Souls 3.\n* Leveling up works **basically** the same as in Dark Souls 3.\n* Elden Ring\u2019s character stats work **basically** the same as in Dark Souls 3. With the removal of vitality and changing Luck\u2019s name to Arcane. Luck and Arcane work basically the same but arcane has more utilities.\n\n### That would be fine, if\u2026\n\nThe game was named Dark Souls 4. But it isn\u2019t.\n\nLet\u2019s take Bloodborne as an example, the changes to gameplay are dramatic. The fundamentals of the gameplay are changed, the pacing, your agression towards enemies, the way you think, everything. Elden Ring brings nothing like that. I\u2019ll spare you of listing all the things Bloodborne changes because this isn\u2019t about it. And if you were to look at Sekiro it would be way worse. But I don\u2019t believe it to be a fair comparison because Sekiro is not an Action RPG, it is in another genre of games and is from another publisher.\n\n### What it actually changed.\n\nThey added a Jumping button to the main character movement, which allows for more vertical exploration. This is good, but Jumping is almost never viable in a combat scenario, which is disappointing.\n\nIn regards of combat, we have Block Counters, Crouching Attacks and Revamped Jump Attacks, I\u2019ve only found the last two to be useful, the follow up attack on the Block Counter is way too slow, so most enemies are too fast for it, especially bosses.

Or at least some ashes of war that change the moveset of your weapon, like making your sword larger with magic, just like Moonlight Greatsword in bloodborne.\n\nThose are just some things that I believe would've added a lot to the gameplay, and I was hoping to see ever since the game got announced. Considering how much it takes from Dark Souls 3 already, wouldn't be too much to do these too. \n\n# Disappointing open world\n\nI had a lot of fun while exploring the open world for the first 20 hours or so, while I was still in Limgrave. But at each area I reached, I was disappointed every time by how the exploration changes so little in the new areas. You walk around, you see a door, or a ruined structure, or a cave. You enter it, you fight some enemies and maybe a boss, and you get a reward.

It felt a lot like the \"open world\" was just a very large Dark Souls level. The same enemies always spawned at the same places and there weren\u2019t enemies or encounters that moved around or changed locations. Lightning bolts always striked at the same set places and things like rains, storms and blizzards happened so rarely or were so indifferent to gameplay that I almost didn\u2019t perceive them.\n\n### Respawning and fast travelling\n\nThe respawning and fast travelling ruin the day-night cycle and weather changes. Every time you fast travel or respawn after dying, it\u2019s daytime and sunny. I basically never got to see some areas at night because the game didn\u2019t allow me to, always booting me to daytime everytime I respawned.

Enabling you to fast travel that much seems like an excuse to not think too much about how traversal works in the game. Maybe if I needed to walk around more I wouldn\u2019t have missed as much encounters with NPCs, \u201cWandering\u201d enemies, or caves and dungeons as I did.\n\n### Exploration and Rewards\n\nThe exploration in Elden Ring felt a lot like a chore to me. Every time I got to a new area, I\u2019d take the map for it, then I\u2019d see what were the points of interest in the map, and would go to them, complete them, and get my reward. Over, and over, and over. The same enemies, the same structures, the same dungeons, the same bosses, and 90% of the rewards were useless to my character. Eventually I grew tired of it and I was only exploring the game in hope of finding something fresh or just because of my own sense of completion.  Also, because the encounters in the overworld were so uninspired, offered no real rewards by beating them, and didn\u2019t really stand in my way, I started ignoring every single overworld enemy I could, and ran directly to the dungeons. Doing this made me miss a lot of NPCs and other encounters that stand in the middle of the overworld with no indicator at all.\n\nAlso the reward system absolutely does not work in a game this big. Whatever is the build you\u2019re running, 90% of the items you\u2019ll find will be completely useless to your character. That makes exploration feel even more meaningless and frustrating. In Dark Souls, if you explored an area and got an item you\u2019re not going to use, you lost 20 minutes. Do the same thing in Elden Ring, and you\u2019ve lost 2 hours. Also, considering the amount of spells and incantations the game just throws around as rewards because the developers simply did not know what to put at the end of the dungeon, 60 to 70 hours of my playthrough were just wasted away, considering I only used like 5 incantations throughout the entire game.\n\n## I\u2019m obviously shitting on reused content\n\nElden Ring could be half the size it is, and be twice as fun. About 60 hours into the game, I was tired of my character build, and I played 120 hours with that build. I did try to use incantations to spice it up, some ashes of war, some different physicks, but in the end, I was still using an Ultra Great Sword, and I was still tired of doing the same shit over and over again, with the same build, versus the same enemies.\n\n# Big Dark Souls\n\nElden Ring makes no effort at all in being its own thing. The game finds itself unable to step outside of Dark Souls III\u2019s shadow, because that game was successful, and made lots of money. So they did it again, but bigger. And guess what, it worked. This completely steers away from FS design philosophy, and what really makes Dark Souls important as a Video Game. \n\n**Dark Souls had the courage to step out of what was mainstream in its time, and set the foundations for what would become not only a sub-genre, but also an entire sub-culture of video games.** **Bloodborne, Sekiro, God of War, Darksiders, Hollow Knight, Zelda, Code Vein, Nioh, Jedi Fallen Order, Blasphemous, Salt and Sanctuary, and so many more games took so much from Dark Souls\u2019 combat and game design.**   \n**Dark Souls was revolutionary.** \n\nElden Ring might have the largest world, the most fluid combat, the most amount of enemies, the fastest bosses, the most amount of spells, armor, and weapons. But Elden Ring brings so little to the table, that it fails to be an independent IP, and instead hides itself behind the safety of doing again something that had already worked before. Despite being open world, DS3\u2019s stolen mechanics in Elden Ring conflict so much with the bigger map that it rarely felt like open world and only like big dark souls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Elden Ring bad because it's too much like Dark Souls 3.**"

(see Gojo's vs Higuruma's)\n\nThe reason for that, I theorize, is the usage of Jujutsu and how it changed over the years. Before, to quote Megumi: \"The value of life itself was different\" and \"sorcerers wanted to die in battle\". But battling **other sorcerers.** Thus, you can get way more value from a domain with complex rules and some restrictions for its guaranteed hit to activate. \n\nBut nowadays, there are way less Sorcerer vs Sorcerer battles, and those are discouraged and scorned upon by the higher ups. (whoever they are) You can see that in the way they treated Hakari Kinji, who started a fight club that allowed sorcerers and has a domain expansion more akin to the older ones, designed to fight other sorcerers.(Kirara says the higher ups hate Kinji's technique) As it has set rules and it expects its opponent to understand those rules. \n\nThat reflects how, over the years, war and fighting became less and less present in human society, and Diplomacy started being used more. \n\nYou can't really tell the higher ups are wrong for doing that, because their reasons are understandable, if you encourage Jujutsu usage turned to killing curses, you can reduce Sorcerer on Sorcerer violence (probably). But we do know how corrupt and overrall assholes they can be just to maintain a status quo. Like how they blamed shibuya on Satoru and Masamichi.\n\nOther thing that connects to this is how Sukuna can be so strong (on top of the strong sense of self thing). He fought so many sorcerers that he achieved a whole new level of understanding on Cursed Energy and Cursed Techniques. He probably explored and studied every aspect of it and has done some absurd shit. Something that would not be allowed nowadays by the higher ups, they'd rather keep it simple and straightforward, enough to kill most curses. \n\nModern sorcerers not only lack raw power to fight older ones, but also lack that deeper understanding and study of cursed energy. The average modern sorcerer is way below the average ancient sorcerer.\n\nThat goes to show how much thought Gege has put into his worldbuilding even though he doesn't actively explain it."

If it's already been asked, I apologise, I just couldn't find it.\n\nSo, my first question is obviously about the swagbucks live offerwall. Which offers are worth it on there? I see quite a few that are about 6000 sb, but I'm not sure if they'd be doable, so I just wanted to ask some people who've actually done them.\n\nI like the SB live offerwall, since it credits so quickly and seems to be more reliable from what I've seen.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso, I'm going to stick a question on here which has already (kind of, only partially) been asked but I wasn't sure the answer entirely. Raid: Shadow Legends. There are lot of these offers, but the best (highest paying, anyway) one I've found is for 7212 sb on SB live (I've commented about one than was about 6582 I think, but I've found a higher one).\n\nThe 7212 sb offer is to open 2 **Sacred** Shards within 30 days. Other people have completed the **Void**  Shard offer, which is a different (and from what I've heard) far easier offer to complete. However I don't have that offer, but the one I'm seeing is probably a lot higher paying (I would presume) than the Void offers.\n\nIs it doable? I don't usually play these games, I'm more of a Board Kings offer type of guy, so I'll need to learn a bit about it, I suppose. Is there a way to pay to get the Sacred shards quicker, or more immediately? Seeings as the offer is over 7000 sb, putting money into getting it doesn't seem too bad.\n\nI have so many questions, which I almost feel embarrassed to put here; Is the game boring? Does it have heaps of ads? Can you just play it as long as you like? Is it similar to any games I'd know? What do you even do in it? Will I delete it out of frustration? Did you hate the game, or was it fun? Should I do a different offer because this one isn't possible? (You definitely don't need to answer all these if you don't want, by the way)\n\nSorry for all the questions, I prefer having at least some idea what the offer I'm doing is like, especially when it will definitely be a harder one than my regular offers. Thank you so much if you can answer any of my questions, I really appreciate it.\n\nAgain, thank you!"

                "body": "Alright, I'll get this straight. So recently I've been bouncing on and off with tests and cognitive functions and other tests. So I decided both for me to analyze myself, and others to have a second input if possible. I've answered the questionnaire as shortly and honestly as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI'm 23. Male. Mostly quiet, outgoing with others at work, home, friends. I like joking and coming up with funny puns, deadpan jokes, and slightly mocking jokes. I like to entertain at times and keep a good mood with everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?\n\nMild Asperger's, as far as I know. But I think I've overcome it overtime with developed social skills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nFamily is/was always very traditional, when it comes to religion. Honestly, it didn't really bother me and I always naturally gravitated towards religion, spirituality, and what not. I was born very spiritual myself. I had some kind of abusive past from my father. Though, I'd rather not elaborate beyond that,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nGrocery worker/organizer on the shelves. For the meantime, yes. Why? Temporary income. Why not? Because I'm not going to work this job for my whole life, obviously I'm going to be more productive and do something I actually love doing. A better profession / career.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't mind some time alone, but after awhile I'll start to lose my shit and become paranoid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?\n\nI like engaging in sensory experiences, it actually developed a lot recently thanks to working stable at my job for now. Actually I wouldn't mind an outdoor event like parties, bars, pubs, but after a while I'll be worn out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI'm very, very curious. I like to know a lot, I like hearing and listening to others (I like and feel comfortable with). I have a lot of bizarre and slight ingenious ideas, that I want to be executed. Though, some can't be executed, not due to laziness but instead mostly my job that's occupying my time. More conceptual and slight environmental/physical. It's a bit hard to elaborate on them, because they come in so many patterns and underlying sources and bases. But in short, let's say creative solutions to a practical crisis. As well as solutions to an effective thinking process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI think I would enjoy actually, but probably in small doses since my patience can wear thin. It literally depends on how much I'm willing to invest. Naturally, I'm very patient but then the stupidest question from someone can tick me off. I'll be the motivator and keeper in line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nMostly, very much so. I don't think I'm coordinated at times, because I have many racing thoughts at the same time, and I can lose focus because of that. I do like working with tools whenever I get the chance. And it seems very interesting what each tool does and what is it's intended purpose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nArtistic as in creating physical art, no. I mostly like surreal art, an art that seems out of this world and hard to grasp in a physical sense. I also like modern interior design, vintage, victorian. Architecture-wise as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nThe past is always interesting, because:\n\n1. It teaches you lessons, bad or good. What you decide to do with them is up to you.\n2. It makes you appreciate your time more with others, activities you like to engage in.\n3. It makes you feel like you made some kind of difference.\n\nThe present is always welcome, enjoying every moment,\n\nThe future is kind of complicated to explain, as in abstract form and thinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI'd feel pretty satisfied and obliged to do so. Mostly at work since I have to cooperate with other workers. Sometimes I'm ticked off, when things aren't going efficiently and makes me resent everything and everyone. But I've learned to manage that.\n\nI'd also help friends I feel close to with consulting, criticizing, and finding solutions to their problems. I'd also motivate them to be better and address their flaws, when they need to deal with a critical situations in their life, for example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nAlways. Though I'm not entirely blind to the emotional side of life. Don't get me wrong. I enjoy every moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nVery much so, and even stated so in the 'requested to do something for others' question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI don't like controlling others very much. Each person is entitled to what they want to achieve and do in their lives. Indirectly, probably more silently when they don't notice that I can get the upper hand. Reverse psychology is the name of me doing it, I think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nMusic, psychology, PCs, thinking, reading articles.\n\nMusic is literally a world of its own, I like it because it gives me insight into how each song beats are made, lyrics and what makes it so unique.\n\nPsychology because it gives more insight to others thought processes. It helps you understand them better.\n\nReading articles, mostly to enrich knowledge and how I can apply it to myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI like logical, creativity, and slight physical senses. Why? Logical would challenge your thinking more and lead you to come up with a better and ready mindset for future obstacles. Creativity would enrich your world and develop your ways to come up with better solutions, jokes, groundbreaking / mind blowing ideas. Physical senses for a much more realistic and touchy application. A more grounded approach to be ready for any upcoming obstacles like in the logical description.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI'm very good with strategizing when it comes to things, that I consider important. For things that may seem inefficient or unnecessary to me, I'd just rather wing and improvise as I go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What's important to you and why?\n\nCareer, success, financial stability, house. Eventually a partner, male or **female**. Don't mind either, as long as they both look good and have a kind spirit. The reason to \"why?\" is self-explanatory and mostly because it's related to survival.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What are your aspirations?\n\nN/A.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nN/A.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nVery bright, promising, and motivating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nEither emotionally intense or emotionally detached.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nAt a medium-high level. Daydreaming at times, and while I do, yes I'm simultaneously aware of it. Like sensing presences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\"What can I do to enjoy myself better?\" and then do whatever comes up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nNot a whole lot of time usually, but also depends on the life area it's related to. And no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI reflect on them pretty fast. Emotions are necessary to guide certain decisions and enjoy some things in life. But they don't need to let them blind your perspective of reality and how things and certain situations are. Otherwise, you can be screwed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nN/A.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\nUsually not a rule breaker. Authority should be challenged only if it is unjust and biased. I'd break rules solely for the purpose of breaking them. Just because you have to stick to the rules and maintain the \"tradition\" it'll just seem boring, in my perspective. It also depends if it's used to accomplish certain things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\nMy own house/apartment, partner, stable career related to computers, some booze from time to time, cigarettes (\"OMG, unhealthy habit\", don't worry I'm aware).\n\n\\*If I could afford to do it, leather jackets, Harley Davidson motorbikes, zippos, whiskey at a pub with cigars / pipe."

It might or might not be familiar to some occupying themselves within the MBTI community. And then ask about my type/typing based on all this as well.\n\nSo my concept is that, when a certain type is aware of their functions, or let's say 'develop' their type, the faster they develop the more they're likely to act like their auxiliary or tertiary, or inferior function for example.\n\nSo I'm an ISTP, 'determined' by both 16p (horrible site for newbies to get into this topic) and Sakinorva's cognitive functions (Which I believe is more accurate). Now, sometimes I feel like I'm too 'nice' and 'bubbly' because I don't act like the stereotype of ISTP.  Yes, I'm aware ISTPs differ from each other.\n\nSecondly in Sakinorva's enneagram test, I got an overall enneagram 3w2 (Which is typical for ENXJs I believe), along with wings considered 5w4 (INTX?). \nInstinctual variants are sx/sp. And tritype is 539 (IXTP).\n\nThirdly, my socionics test results are LII-INTj and ILE-ENTp 100% as likely. With a dominant Ti.\n\nSo based on all this, I thought that I might be either a developed XSFJ or a developed XNFJ. So this is why I was pretty much curious about what others think. Sometimes a third person perspective can really help enrich and help reflect what seems more likely. Don't get me wrong, I'm well aware and confident of my type and answered all the tests authentically.\n\nBut the point is, what are your thoughts?"

This is something that is difficult for him to do. I don't want to scare him, and he said he was ok with it. I just worry if I am doing something bad. I want to know if it was ok for me to ask this question, because I dont want to force him to do anything. I have trouble with expressing my needs in my relationships and I have a lot of doubt.

I married the man of my dreams and the reception is just perfect. Until my ex shows up and asks me to meet him behind the reception hall so he can give me a gift. I meet you and you show me a video of me getting spit roasted by you and your best friend that you swore you deleted. You decide to blackmail me into fucking one last time if I don\u2019t want you posting that on social media on my wedding day.

So you can actually familiarise yourself with the exam questions. The theory can be a bit hard but I find it very easily understood if you explain it to your family members or your friends. That's a really good way to consolidate your knowledge of Chemistry. I usually take notes and read the content before class so I technically learn it twice. Do practice papers and ask your teacher questions. For the exams, I find multiple choice very hard and there is a huge time constraint because of it. That being said, I recommend you \"training yourself\" to finish them quickly. \n\nFor Methods, create a bound reference throughout the year, I crammed mine two days before the exam. Just do a bunch of papers. Do a bit of textbook questions but they are very easy in comparison to the exam paper ones. I actually struggle with Methods a lot and the Exam 2s are so different each year. I find that VCAA just throws you inconsistent questions each year (it can be different types of graphs, a box, a bridge, a chair, a composite function that makes no sense whatsoever etc.). You don't really have to take notes for this subject, so practice is key. However, you should still make a bound reference for a sense of security. Also, exams have a lot of application questions, so you have to learn how to dissect the question and understand what they're trying to ask.\n\nGood luck next year! :D",

Before someone inevitably replies to this about that being a circular definition, I would like to point to the current definition of human. The current dictionary definition of human is \"a human being, especially a person as distinguished from an animal or (in science fiction) an alien.\" That whole thing essentially boils down to defining human as human, which is perfectly fine because we are all capable of understanding what a human is. The same can be said for a man or woman. We don't need a specific definition because we are capable of understanding what they are just by living our lives.",

                "body": "Firstly, I'd like to bring up I wouldn't say dictionary definitions are how we typically explain simpler concepts like sandwich, women, man, or human. I don't recall ever being taught exactly what a sandwich was or looking that word up in the dictionary, I'm pretty sure concepts such as that were taught by people pointing at pictures and saying things like \"this is a sandwich and this is not\" but thats as far as I'll expand on that right now as I feel this definition argument is growing repetitive and isn't really going anywhere. As for the concept of gender euphoria, I'd be happy to expand on that. It's really something fairly simply, its the term used to refer to the happiness felt by expressing the gender identity which you can identify with. Its hard to be mire specific than that as what causes gender euphoria varies from person to person and identity to identity. It can come from simple things like wearing gender affirming clothing or using gender affirming pronouns or it can come from slightly more drastic things like hormones and surgery. Every person who identifies as anything under the trans umbrella feels some kind of gender euphoria when they do certain gender affirming things (as far as I know anyways), whereas not everyone under that umbrella feels the gender dysphoria typically associated with being trans. Though not an expert on the subject, I'm fairly certain the reason its defined by euphoria rather than dysphoria is not only because of the identities mentioned in my previous comment but also because a cis person expressing their gender identity in a way besides the one assigned at birth wouldn't feel that euphoria, whereas a trans person would feel euphoria even if they've never felt dysphoria before. I hope that helps to explain it as thats the best I can do with a general overview. If you have more specific questions I may be able to answer them but as mentioned previously I'm not an expert on the subject so what I've said above is most of what I know",

                "body": "You misunderstand, the point of that was not to say a hotdog is not a sandwich, it was to point out that while society at large would not casually refer to one as a sandwich it is still, likely unintentionally, included in the current definition. So currently if two people were to argue about whether or not a hot dog is a sandwich, they would both be correct just in different ways. To use the the same terms as before, one would be right based on prescriptivism, while the other would be correct based on descriptivism. Since both are perfectly valid arguments the two would never reach any sort of conclusion, thus muddling the communication process which is the exact opposite of what language as a concept strives to achieve. It is only with the more circular definition that this problem is solved. For example, lets say sandwich was defined as \"an object referred to by two or more people as a sandwich.\" While still not perfect, it does now allow for both mindsets about what is and is not a sandwich to coexist. Now, a hot dog is only a sandwich if both people communicating agree that it is a sandwich, thus eliminating any confusion or hinderance to the communication process that was previously there. Society at large will likely continue to refer to the same old things as sandwiches, now without greatly reduced confusion, and small subsets can still refer to agreed upon items as sandwiches without being incorrect so long as they all understand what the others are talking about. So I continue to fail to understand what the problem is with something having a circular definition when really it acts as a great solution to many linguistic problems. It only seems like a bad idea because the human brain likes to think that everything can be sorted into neat little boxes with perfect boundaries, but the reality is that almost nothing can be put into these boxes. I mentioned previously that the current definition of Human is already circular and likely has been for awhile, and no one noticed or cared(as far as I know anyways) because it really is the best definition. There is no one defining trait shared across all humans, similarly to how there is no one defining trait between all women, men, or even sandwiches. When it comes to ideas and complex and variable as this circular definitions truly work best, as demonstrated by the definition of human. No one cared about that definition being circular, and yet for some reason the word woman or man being defined similarly is sparking a national debate, so while the supposed problem people have is the circular definition, the only real problem many of them have with it is that it makes a step towards including trans people rather than ostracising them. Not to say that why you believe this, the \"circular definitions are bad\" thing sounds reasonable and logical at first, but thats why I've attempted to illustrate that they aren't necessarily bad so you can see the real reason many people say this. And you know what, while I'm here I might as well bring this up. I believe I saw in another comment that you mentioned the reason you believe the concept of being trans to be a mental illness is because of a hatred of the current body caused by gender dysphoria. This seems to imply that dysphoria is an inherent part of being trans, which is simply not the case. Being trans is defined by euphoria, not dysphoria. It is the happiness brought about by expressing another gender identity that makes someone trans, not necessarily the sadness caused by their current one. Many people who are transfemme or transmasc may simply prefer expressing themselves as the other gender but not hate the one they were assigned at birth. And while I don't know as much about these identities, it seems to me that many demi-boys, demi-girls, and other people who express more androgynous gender identities may already feel their body matches the way they want to look and simply want to make changes to their day to day life. And I definitely don't know enough about neogenders to attempt to explain their relationship with gender dysphoria, although that doesn't make them any less valid I just personally don't know much about them. So there are plenty of examples of trans people who aren't unhappy with the body they were born in, so I don't really see how this could be called a mental illness. I hope this helped explain some points you seemed confused on, and hope you have a nice day",

I completely agree that the solution is to create a society where these ideals aren't being pushed onto men and the best way to do that is to becoming accepting of these qualities that had been previously deemed \"feminine\" and therefore \"bad\". The only thing I was trying to say is that due to the fact that we haven't created that society yet you can't blame men for not being in touch with their emotions since thats all that they've ever learned from our current society. Instead a more apt solution is to explain to them what was wrong with what they were taught and attempt to help them come to better terms with their emotions, thus preventing them from teaching their children and loved the same things they were taught.",

So I set about making a character named Hels who's been intrinsically linked to the dead her whole life, originally discovering this when her pet rabbit died and later when her parents died. At times this connection has been overwhelming and scary, and though it kept her with her parents for a brief time longer than normally possible, it is a trait she wishes to rid from herself. Until she can do that, she simply must train to control it to the best of her ability. After doing all of that I got stuck on whether I want her to be a Tiefling or an Earth Genasi. I could see either one working from a flavour perspective, and even though I don't care too much about mechanics they both have their pros and cons there too. So I was just wondering what you guys think, Tiefling, Earth Genasi, or something else entirely?"

                "body": "I was fortunate enough to have supportive if emotionally un-attuned parents, and am fortunate that my dyscalculia is mild enough that I can still get by day-to-day, I think. My deficit in math, while modest, was noticeable by second grade because of my strong aptitude for other subjects, especially language arts. My teacher called my parents. I have no memory of the interaction other than swift and sudden shame. My teacher had called my parents and that was bad. Then began a negative attitude towards math.\n\nI have many memories of crying over my math homework while my dad got frustrated with my lack of understanding and eventually walked away, leaving me in deep shame. I never failed math, but got Bs overall and Cs on quizzes where in other subjects I earned only As. Fractions and algebra were particularly painful; even now seeing x's and y's gives me anxiety. Geometry was better--something about the shapes made things more intuitive. My math teachers were unremarkable and my parents never sought tutoring for me, perhaps because my grades weren't \"bad\" enough.\n\nDespite a high interest in and aptitude for science, I began avoiding advanced science classes because of my fear of math. In high school, multiple teachers campaigned for me take physics but I stanchly refused. Similarly, I earned a 5 on the AP Biology test and was offered a full ride to a state school for biology because I was a girl, but I turned that down, too. While a part of me feels shame and regret for not taking those opportunities, I'm also angry that no one did anything to help. Why cajole me about physics without offering me tutoring or some other kind of support? I can't recall receiving any resources or genuine acknowledgement of my frustration. Nowadays, my dad blames my \"bad math teachers\" and I feel a bitter kind of humor. He would prefer to blame someone else rather than own that he, the \"math whiz,\" made a daughter with a disability and failed to parent her in this regard. Typical. And as I type this, it's really not funny. Just sad.\n\nIn college, I continued to avoid math. I took an oceanography course to satisfy my math requirements even though I would've loved to take astronomy. It turned out okay--I really enjoyed that class. I majored in English lit, took Japanese, and studied a smattering of other topics--film, anthropology, Asian American culture, photography, art history. I think I had a true liberal arts education, and I really enjoyed it. For someone like me with already strong communication skills, I think this education truly built the foundation upon which all my current success has grown.\n\nI would go on to teach test prep (not the math!), get an MFA in creative writing, and teach writing. I'm now doing a second master's in clinical mental health counseling to become a therapist. Despite little formal training, I seem to have a strong aptitude for this work. Much of it can be credited to my 10 years of teaching experience, I think (teaching and counseling share many transferable skills) but I also wonder if a dyscalculic brain is naturally strong in things like emotional intelligence and communication. Or, if it's that + my particular upbringing.\n\nPart of me still feels sad that I never got to meet physicist-me or biologist-me. I think I would've excelled at that work and been a wonderful science-communicator, a Carl Sagan-type (I admire him) and an advocate for women and underrepresented identities in my field. But I'm also doing important work now. I think society has a nasty bias where STEM is seen as the most respectable and important work, which simply isn't true. I try to remind myself that I swim in that nasty sea all the time.\n\nWriting this out, I see how my dyscalculia has impacted the shape of my life and I mourn that no one saw or helped me. But we dyscalculics are valid and skilled as we are. We experienced hardship in childhood and may still, but we are not those children anymore and have more wisdom and resilience than we know. Our experiences equip us with a powerful empathy that we can use to help others so they don't have to suffer like we did.",

They feel that they aren\u2019t as competent or intelligent as others might think\u2014and that soon enough, people will discover the truth about them. Those with imposter syndrome are often well accomplished; they may hold high office or have numerous academic degrees.\" The piece credits imposter syndrome to  struggles with self-efficacy, perfectionism, and neuroticism, as well as female and POC identities.\n\nI'm in the internship year of my internship. Everyone has imposter syndrome.\n\n* Worried about your first-time counseling skills? Imposter syndrome.\n* Questioning your commitment to the field after some gnarly readings in your crisis intervention class? Imposter syndrome.\n* Scared you won't find an internship or a job? Imposter syndrome.\n\nBut literally all of us are at least somewhat new to this work. We do not hold high office in the ACA or a counseling degree. We cannot *be* imposters because *we aren't even counselors yet.* \n\nWe're not imposters. We're just moving through the very normal feelings of trying something new. \n\nI know imposter syndrome is real and valid in our field and others. I also think calling a thing it's not hurts our chances to address it. If we can externalize our feelings, for example (\"Well, I'm just feeling like an imposter because I'm a woman. Stupid sexism!\"), we might miss an opportunity for deeper self-reflection. \n\nAt times, I have felt insecure and scared about my skills. But perhaps because I come from a teaching background, I know that's just a normal part of being a student. And we're all students of our field and our clients, forever. Doubting ourselves from time to time is normal and healthy. \n\nHaha I don't know why this bothers me. I promise I'm not gatekeeping imposter syndrome! I just hear it everywhere, and in the words of Inigo Montoya, *\"I do not think that word means what you think it means.\"*",

                "body": "My back story is pretty much the same as everyone else's: always struggled with nasty ass acne, tried everything, nothing worked. About 6 months ago I finally went to an actual dermatologist who put me on antibiotics + topical gels and creams. None of that had any effect so he decided to prescribe me with Roaccutane. I was rather surprised, because when I first met him he told me accutane was not even an option for me because I have clinical depression and I take anti depressants. \nPart of me really, really, really wants to say 'screw it, lets do this' but I feel very hesitant about it at the same time. My main concerns are the side effects, especially the dryness and the increase of acne at the beginning of treatment. I work 30 hours a week at a lunch place, it's a very interactive job where customers look at me all day which makes me incredibly insecure already. I consider myself the most hideous monster to walk the surface of planet earth, and I feel so sorry for everyone who has to look at me, let alone talk to me. I always wear make up to work to give me a little more security, but I know I still look like a bag of shit and I can barely get myself to leave the house for anything other than work. Being acne free after accutane sounds to me like the Promised Land, and since I am at the depths of my despair, I would be willing to try it. But the work situation makes me so anxious. What if my skin cracks open really badly? I don't think I could get myself to (wo)man up and go to work. If my face starts flaking and falling apart I will probably want to hide in a pitch black room for the enitre 7 months of medication. I am seriously considering quitting my job so I don't have to go through the humiliation of facing hundreds of customers daily, with my skin in an even shittier condition than it is now. At the same time though, my job is very much the only thing keeping my depression in check. I depend on having a schedule, a reason to get out of bed and the feeling of actually doing something like any normal person would. \nI am beyond embarrassed about all of this and I don't have anyone in my life to discuss it with. I've thought about reaching out to my psychiatrist but I'm afraid she won't even allow me to go on Accutane, since the side effects can cause depression to get worse. (also I don't want her to think I'm a vain whiny bitch)\nI absolutely can't talk to my derm about anything, I've never even mentioned my insecurities. He's always very hurried and when I ask him questions he seems annoyed. When I wanted some further information about the possible side effects he literally told me \"you probably won't even get any, I am just obligated to mention them\" which I highly doubt is true, since every single accutane user mentions severe dryness as one of the worst side effects. \nI sincerely hope someone is able to see the point I'm trying to make with this incomprehensible story, and would be willing to give me some advice. I know quitting my job is a very drastic thing to do, so I need to know just how awful/unbearable my skin is going to be from the dryness and increase of acne in the first months of treatment. If I do decide to quit my job, I have to give a one month's notice, so I would still be at risk of looking like everyone's worst nightmare / getting nosebleeds all over the food / getting super emotional in front of coworkers and customers. \nSo please, even if you have no idea what to tell me, talk to me at least. Tell me about your experience, what can I expect? What products can I use to minimize the damage? Do you think it's wise for me start accutane at all? My acne controls my entire life and I'm so done with it.\nThank you, and sorry."

A starting 0 must be immediately followed by p.\n3. No trailing 9's.\n\nThe order is not dense. There is no number between 0.0888... and 0.2. This is a quirk of the English language because if 9 were somehow the smallest or the largest, this example doesn't work.\n\nThe order is not complete. We first prove that it's complete if we remove condition 3 (edit: not quite, see below). Given a set of sequences, choose the largest available character in the first digit, discard all sequences with a smaller first digit, then do the same for the second digit and so on.\n\nNext, we prove that if A is a sequence with trailing 9's and A < B is a sequence without trailing 9's, there is a sequence C without trailing 9's and A < C < B. Locate where the trailing 9's in A starts after the decimal place, and flip the digit of A corresponding to the second non-9 digit of B to 1, then replace the remaining trailing 9's of A with trailing 8's. As an illustration, if A = 0.999... and B = 0.1234..., then C = 0.91888.... If we apply the same algorithm to A and C, we get D = 0.991888....\n\nThis shows that if the least upper bound of a set without rule 3 has trailing 9's, it doesn't have a least upper bound with rule 3.

Vocabulary and grammar things are simply footnotes for sentences in which they first appear. One may call this approach \"semi-natural\"? Also, they show you the most basic, most unmarked major sentences first (e.g. \"I am here\", \"Her house is big\"). Minor sentences like greetings or idioms rarely appear, if at all. I find this approach quite illuminating and suitable for me. It presumably also resembles how a linguist might learn a language through field study.\n\nFastlingo currently have apps for English, German, French and Spanish, but not for Italian. Does anyone know resources for Italian which have a similar flavour? Thanks in advance."

To a field of characteristic p, p would also be special in a tautologous way.\n\nAn example of 2 being a non-tautologously special prime is in quadratic reciprocity, where practically every statement has p,q as odd primes. But why and how exactly is 2 special in this context?\n\nTo generalise, are there any contexts when an odd prime is uniquely special, and 2 is as \"non-special\" as other remaining odd primes?\n\nMy conjecture is that 2 is special because of the abundance of duality- and reciprocity-like structures in mathematics, which often imply \"things modulo 2\".\n\nInput from any subfield is welcome."

No eye contact.\n\n\"Everyone is infected.\"\n\nThe door closes as Minister plunges into deep thoughts. Wouldn't a \"no\" every day be too pessimistic? We should say \"yes\" no matter what. Affirmative is the way to go.\n\nFive hours of debate later and it is agreed upon that the Ministry should remain positive and cheer the public up with a \"yes\" each day. They feel the best way is to report whether there are cases who succumbed to The Virus instead.\n\nSo another resource optimisation it is. \"Yes, yes, yes.\" The encouraging message would reach every door each day without fail. People are so uplifted they can feel their souls drifting towards heaven.\n\nUntil one day Minister arrived at the office, sat down and arranged his files til 5pm, yet no one came to tell him whether it was \"yes\" or \"no\". He went home and, for that day, there was no media release.\n\nThe second day he bumped into a journalist: \"Yesterday was a yes. I think there were a few from your ministry as well.\"\n\nEmbarrassed for being caught ponning his daily duty, Minister offers: \"How about I go to the media release room, and you come and tell me yes or no at 4pm sharp.

Until one day no journalist had come as of 2257.\n\nMinister noticed the time on his Rolex when he was arranging his files, but he did not want to skip a media release for the second time - it was embarrassing enough for that first time. Fortunately for him, a young man emerged, dishevelled.\n\n\"Today is a yes.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you so much, but you should probably dress up nicer to this formal occasion.\"\n\nMinister stands, and announces: \"Yes.\"\n\nYoung man turned and left.\n\nMinister basically lives in the media release room now, and that young man would come each day so Minister could fulfill his important daily duty. But he always comes without a pair of nice cufflinks, sometimes even blood-stained. Minister puckers his lips and thinks to himself, but goes back to arranging his files anyway.\n\nYoung man arrived one day and whispered to Minister: \"You know I told you it was a no about two weeks ago? I think it should have been yes. I found one under a table with her diary today.\"\n\nAnother mistake made. Minister almost could not bear the shame. But he thought he could make an erratum announcement. The genius idea struck him so hard he coughed violently. Then he did the usual, but with an erratum, before the young man.\n\nYoung man turned and left.\n\nWhile arranging his files Minister noticed it was 2314 already. Young man had not come. He stared at his Rolex until 2355 and started panicking. There was no way he would skip a second media release and make a third mistake. But what could he do? He scratched his head almost a little too hard, but he was blessed by his geniusness yet again.\n\nMinister stood up, in his usual fashion, with some really nice cufflinks, and how solemnly he thus spake:\n\n\"Yesn't.\"\n\nIt was so genius he grinned a little while sitting down.\n\nMinister went back to arranging his files."

I have heard they\u2019ve tried treatments for loss of smell and taste...\n\nAnd the second one will try to understand why symptoms reappear in some people even weeks after first symptoms.\n\nApparently at least 5% of infected people are concerned with this long-term form of the disease and mostly women.\n\nHope things are also moving forward in the US for our cases. We\u2019ve created a new # on Twitter in France and thanks to this, now media are covering our cases and some doctors are starting to pay attention to us. \n\nI think if we don\u2019t speak for ourselves, nobody will ever care unfortunately.\nStay strong !"

For me , I actually found it helpful . \n\nI got diagnosed with autism during the spring of 2021 by my psychiatrist . I was 14 , almost 15 at that time , I was dealing with a lot , and autism wasn't my only diagnosis . I am grateful that I got diagnosed with autism , first because after I got diagnosed , my brother received his diagnosis as well , it seemed to me like his psychologist made the connection based on me , since autism is inherited and it is common for siblings to be both autistic . And second because it made things easier for me , I finally feel (a little bit) understood by my surroundings , especially at school , before I got diagnosed , teachers treated me horribly , most of them believed I was acting up , I was faking my struggles , school was a nightmare to me , I was heavily bullied for being \"weird\" , however , things changed after my diagnosis , mom told my teachers , who all seemed to be very understanding , hopefully they don't treat me as a child , they treat me as an actual person who is capable of doing stuff that also happens to be on the autism spectrum . When it comes to my classmates , I haven't told everybody , only my friends who needed to know what I exactly need , after all , I have a disability that needs accomodations , I can't hide it from everyone , and it also seems that people I haven't told know that I have disorders , but they have no idea what they are exactly . \n\nI don't get self-diagnosed people's argument , why is an autism diagnosis bad ? I think it is totally worth it , even if it takes time and it is a little bit expensive , it is very helpful ."

Well , there are many things to explain . \n\nCelebrity crushes are normal , right ? Most of us admire a certain celebrity and find them attractive , no , this is different . \n\nI am 16 now , around 5 , 4 years ago , I had a celebrity crush , it was a kpop idol (That I am still a big fan of but I got over that phase hopefully)  , almost twice my age . It was more than a casual celebrity crush , I was IN LOVE with him , I truly believed that one day I am going to be with him , I couldn't stop fantasizing about him . It had a negative impact on me , I felt so insecure , I hated my appearance and did everything to fit his type , rumours about him having a girlfriend made me have legitimate depressive episodes (I have bipolar and it has been present since I was 8/9) , I stopped eating , going out , talking to peope etc ... I even rejected a guy who liked me due to my crush on that celebrity . My fantasies used to get disturbing at times , I used to fantasize about kidnapping the celebrity and keeping him to myself forever , it was that bad . I got over it when I was 12 and a half , it wasn't a good ending though , I fell in love with my online friend who was 20 years old , she was grooming me , what broke my heart the most is that she disappeared out of the sudden without any explanation . \n\nWell , let's talk about the present , with my current celebrity crush . It's the same feeling once again : Extreme insecurity , it's even worse now knowing that I am transgender and he most likely isn't into men . Extreme jealousy , whenever I hear a rumour about him dating someone , I get filled with rage and jealousy , I even went on to wish death on these women , that aren't even confirmed to be dating him . Disturbing fantasies , and now I am older , there are getting worse , much much worse , I will spare you the details . \n\nI have no one to tell them this , especially since I have been talking to my friends and brother about him and they think I am just a casual fan .\n\nI hate that it's happening again , and I can't stop it .

I read a story on Askreddit about a guy who was found missing from a phone call after he said \"oh shit\" and it brought back this memory.\n\nSo this is last summer. me and my friend are in the basement from my house. We decide to go up to first floor. I clearly remember following her up the stairs. Up the stairs I watch her turn left then say \"Oh my god\". And then i lose sight of her, as if she escaped the corner of my eye. I start to look around... Nothing. I call her name. Nothing.\n\nAt this point I'm getting freaked out. I search the first and second floor yet no one's answering. I decide to go back to the basement even though it makes no sense as this is where we we're coming from. That's where I find her. She's just there lying on the bed, not making a sound. I ask her \"what are you doing? why didn't you answer when I called your name?\" She says she decided to play a game. Not only she has never done that before but why do I have these vivid memories of following her, turning left, saying \"oh my god\"? \n\nOf course I'm someone to always question my perceptions first but I have a feeling that my timeline has shifted on that afternoon.\n\nEdit: Sorry I misremembered for a minute there. She didn't say \"oh shit\". She said \"Oh my god\""

We would be \u201cmeeting up\u201d (never really met her IRL and she\u2019s also working at a different office but we communicate a lot). Then I noticed that the lady near me seemed to be talking at the same time my coworker was talking to the phone. I tried talk to the lady but her conversation switched to \u201cI\u2019m coming back home. I am so excited. I\u2019ll see my baby soon.\u201d What??? I was sure she was just talking with me about work. LMAO\n\nI got off the train and landed on a grassy lot with a beige, Barbie dreamhouse kind of house at the farther end. The sun shone on it too well that it glowed. My dream self called it home. Inside, it was gloomy, like a gothic mansion with dark furniture and bluish hue all around the atmosphere. I was playing some sort of boardgame with my mom and grandma. I was the one who found the boardgame bec we were already bored of the things we do inside the house. We were playing and my mom switched on something on the board and did something to the house. I couldn\u2019t point out what changed since I couldn\u2019t remember but the feel of the house changed. So I went outside, only to find myself doing tennis ball toss/catch with freaking NUNS. Also, the front of the house became shaded, like there\u2019s a half-circle roof over the house\u2019s front and a mini unkept garden right in front.\n\nThe ball was tossed into the bushes and tall grasses of the mini garden but I caught it just in time. Water splashed and apparently the garden was next to some pool where my ex did mid-air somersaults with dolphins. I came back inside the house. I resumed the game with mom while we \u201cwatched\u201d TV. I got bored and switched the channel to some fantasy movie that looked like LOTR. Mom was gone suddenly. But dream self didn\u2019t mind. Like she was just out of the scene. I snuggled into some random dude that my dream self was calling a friend. I never really knew him irl but he was antsy about the show we were watching. On the other side of the mattress was my ex, keeping things to himself while he\u2019s drenched from the dolphin show and half-naked. Our other friend was sitting on the couch with a disapproving face. He said I should be warming my ex instead of the friend I was cuddling. The friend and the friend on the couch were suddenly gone and it was me and my ex alone on the big mattress. No words spoken we cuddled. Only then I wondered why in hell he was small. Like a child spooning me in his fully drenched body and pants. He said \u201cGive it time\u201d and he did grow to his \u201cregular size\u201d and I saw something flutter behind his back. They\u2019re wings. Pure white wings. Our couch friend came back and disgusted he commented, my ex shouldn\u2019t be hugging me anymore. My ex joked that he had enough girls to cuddle anyway in order to \u201csatisfy\u201d our friend\u2019s disappointment. The friend left and my ex and I were spooning (no sex just cuddle) while we watched TV. A third person shot revealed we were not in a house but a fucking cave at the end of a really nice, narrow garden.\n\nContext:\n* It\u2019s been three years since my ex and I talked. This is the first time I dreamed about him post-friendship. Three years ago he stopped being friends with me on his birthday after I revealed I may have been falling in love all over again. And he said he couldn\u2019t handle that kind of relationship given his mental state\n\n* The change of the house\u2019s front looked a lot like the waiting area/ lobby of my old job but it was circular and had a freaking dolphin show\n\n* The coworker was a woman I constantly had remote communications with since she works at a different place\n\n* The \u201cfriend\u201d I initially cuddled was a generic dude the looked a lot like an anime extra with glasses and basic white shirt and black pants\n\n* The friend on the couch appeared recently in my waking state as a name on the list of Facebook friend birthdays\n\n* No, I haven\u2019t watched any dolphin-related videos"

Yesterday afternoon, through intermittent power nap, I think I met him again... taller, lankier, livelier, and really, REALLY delighted to see me. This one only appeared once in my dream. Like, I only remember him because it was so out of the blue to dream about someone I never met in my life.\n\nFor context: I was walking home after buying some bread for the family. Then I came across this young boy: a bit Caucasian-looking, curly-haired, sad eyes. He just then walked me home with his bike in tow. Ever since I was really curious about him. Tried to replicate his face as early as I was 11 but heck my drawing skills were a lot crappier before. Here is my attempt to sketch [him](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/kd1pud/when_i_was_11_i_had_a_dream_about_a_curlyhaired/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nThen, I took a nap yesterday afternoon. 11 years later. Haha. We are on a set of a Christmas short film, with warm lantern lights all around us. It was slightly raining and then he just came to me and offered me his hoodie (the one he's wearing in the dream and the drawing). He was low-key asking me out, too, but I woke up before I said something back.\n\nI def wanna meet him again. I might ask the psychic/reiki master my uncle recently raves about him but you know, in a way that I wouldn't give away so many details about him (I still am skeptical about paranormal practices)."

I struggle socially , although I have many freinds I struggle with eye contact and focus. As a child I used to zone out for hours and my mum said I didn\u2019t really speak as a child . Could all this be related to my concussion ? Or are genetic factors more likely , I definitely struggle a little to get through life even now as a 22 year old who on the face of it is doing well.

I\u2019m a big water drinker and formerly carried around the 1L Yeti with me when running errands/at work. That was tedious though, because it didn\u2019t fit in the cup holder. Oftentimes that led to me tossing it in the back seat of my car and it rolling around aimlessly. I switched to the Yeti tumbler which I like better, but I like the idea of having a liter+ of ice water on me at all times. \n\nMy question is: if you\u2019ve bought the Stanley, do you love it? Especially if you typically buy Yeti products. The comparable Yeti is 35 oz, so the Stanley has the advantage of size. I\u2019ve heard mixed reviews about the Stanley re: it\u2019s capacity to keep things cold. \n\nHonest reviews would be much appreciated! I love my Yeti cups and have never regretted purchasing one, so potentially branching out makes me anxious. \n\nThank you!"

Additionally, the meanings are different. The tamyeez specifies and the idafa shows relation or possession between the two words (similar to \"of\" or apostrophe S as in \"the boy's\" in English). English doesn't have a direct equivalent to the tamyeez so you have to practice it until you get the hang of it.\n\n2.a) The lowest common denominator is the name of the case \"accusative\" and the fact that these meanings are inflected the same way. The accusative by far has the most uses of the three cases, more than double the nominative and genitive combined. \n\nWhy is it so? We don't know. There is one hypothesis that states that in Proto-Afroasiatic, the ancestral language of Proto-Semitic which itself is the ancestral language of Arabic, the \"accusative\" used to be the unmarked form of the noun and the \"nominative\" and \"genitive\" are marked forms. Without overcomplicating it, the \"nominative\" marked the doer of the verb and the \"genitive\" marked the possessor. The \"accusative\" covered everything else. Remember that this is just a hypothesis though and not necessarily the truth.\n\n2.b) There is no meaningful relation as far as I know between the vowels and the meaning of the cases. The u doesn't have to do with the continuation either. Note that the mark of the nominative in the dual is the long \u0101 such as \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646 while the mark of the accusative and genitive is the y \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0646.",

This \u0644\u0627 also changes the predicate to the accusative case just like \u0644\u064a\u0633, but there are restrictions in its usage and it is rarely used. There is also \u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0645\u064a\u0645\u064a\u0629 which negates the nominal sentence with both the subject and predicate being in the nominative case.

They are \u0639\u0646\u062f and \u0644\u062f\u0649 and both mean \"at/near\", *however*, the word \u0644\u062f\u0649 today is very rarely used to mean \"at\" literally and you will mostly see it in the construction of possession (you can change the \u0639\u0646\u062f in the example above with \u0644\u062f\u0649 and that won't change the meaning). You can also use the preposition \u0644 \"to/for\" to form the possession, but for now focus more on \u0639\u0646\u062f and \u0644\u062f\u0649.\n\nThere is also the verb \u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0643 but this doesn't mean the basic \"have\"; it means \"own\" instead. \n\n\u0644\u062f\u064a \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u064c = \"I have a book\"\n\n\u0623\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u064b\u0627 = I own a book",

Whether it is mentioned or not, the verb has a subject. You can ask \"who ate the cake\" and the answer will be \"the boy\" for example. That is, the full sentence is \"the boy eats the cake\".\n\nIn the second example, you can ask \"what did the boy do\", to which the answers could be \"the boy sat\" or \"the boy ate a cake\".\n\nIn the third example, knowing that \"a book\" is an object, you have to ask about the verb that affects it and since verbs always have subjects you also have to ask about it: \"who reads a book\", \"what creates a book\". \n\nAn object is syntactically bound to a verb and a verb is syntactically bound to a subject.

I don't see why saying that subject-predicate distinction leads to the conclusion that subjects have privileged syntactic role, especially with their position. Even in English you can say \"in a garden, in early spring, the boy who wore black sat calmly\" with \"the boy\" being the subject and \"sat\" is the predicate (or everything else is the predicate depending on the analysis). Here \"the boy\" is in the middle of the sentence. \n\nLogically, when we speak there has to be a subject and an information related to it even if one of them is only inferred from context and not expressed with words. Otherwise speech would be meaningless. Also, an object by definition is affected by a verb, and a verb by definition is \"done\" by a subject, therefore an object is dependent on the existence of a subject (even if the subject is not expressed, it is there).",

If this kind of meta post breaks a guidline I'm not aware of then I apologise in advance but I'm not sure how else this issue might be addressed. \n\nAs I'm sure anyone who frequents this sub will be aware, it's pretty common for non-philosophers to ask questions about free will. Determinism, libertarianism, compatibilism etc. An answer that seems to crop up in almost all of these threads is something along the lines of \"philosophers overwhelmingly believe in free will\". \n\nI take it the meaning of this response is actually closer to \"most philosophers are compatibilists\". Compatibilism of course does not have space for a libertarian concept of free will. If compatibilism is true then our actions still come about either deterministically or probabilistically. They aren't \"self-authored\" in the sense that the sole cause for the action but our own transcendental will or something similar. Compatibilism falls very much in the same camp as determinism when it comes to these metaphysical questions about free will. Where it differs is in questions about moral responsibility, freedom to act etc. \n\nSo my actual question is this: Many of the people asking questions about free will are largely only familiar with the libertarian/determinist dichotomy and are engaging with the question primarily on the physical/metaphysical basis, likely not aware of what compatibilism entails. Is it not at best misleading and at worst disingenuous to answer their question with some variation on \"most philosophers believe in free will\"? The kind of free will the posters are asking about is almost always implicitly *libertarian* free will, which the vast majority of philosophers *do not* believe in. In fact, given the anxiety behind some of these posts, I think it would be much more helpful to point out that compatibilism is a way to acknowledge that there aren't a great deal of famously convincing arguments for libertarian free will outside of a religious context, but that most philosophers don't feel that this is a reason for us to radically reorient our ethical systems or give up on ideas like personal responsibility. \n\nApologies for a rather long post, but I thought it was better to ask this open question rather than individually respond every time someone asks a question about free will and gets the \"most philosophers\" response."

[Link](https://youtu.be/R5rNoV1Qy_Q)\n\n\nTo me volunteerism and minarchy provides an alternative to every shortcoming of the state and Anarchy except for maybe three.\n\n\n1.Spontaneous genesis of human life,\n2.The Pareto distribution,\n3.Monopolies on violence.\n\nThe monopolies on violence being more a problem I would attribute to Anarcho-Capitalism.\n\nHere's my issue with the first. If you have a child born inside of your borders and you don't restrict or conditionalize procreation, what do you do with people as they become of age?\n\nThere's a hard held belief that the argument of \"If you don't like something we're doing in the country just leave\" is a non-argument cliche and it is a cliche, but even as such, it does seem to bring up a serious issue. \n\nIn the world today all land mass is occupied? Owned? At least spoken for. Minarchists, myself included seem to believe in a national defense which will require taxes and regulations to fund. Either enough money to make risking personal injury for soldiers voluntary or a draft. What do you do with a child that becomes an adult that doesn't want to abide by these rules? They were born here without their consent inside of our borders. The only other place to put them is in someone else's territory. The only other thing to do is to either let them not abide by the rules or to force them with threat of violence. Threat of violence being the thing that we all hate about the state the most I think. \n\nNeither of these seem good options to me. \n\n1. Under threat of force remove them from our territory and litter them into someone else's territory which is a breach of the NAP on two counts.\n\nOr\n\n2. Compel them under threat of force to conform to our laws and to either fund the common defense or participate in the draft.\n\nIs there a better option that conforms to practical need for collective defense without violating the NAP?\n\nEDIT: Please pick apart the argument.

Not voter fraud or mail in ballots but systems like the alternate vote and single transferable vote. I think that the voting system we have right now is utterly fucked. And as misery loves company, I think the system has come to draw us into an unwilling threesome. Winner takes all voting (in my opinion) forces a two party system with no escape and then slowly radicalizes the two parties it created. Radicalization that seems to tend toward opposing, but extravagantly authoritarian views on both side. I would be terrible at explaining these concepts so I defer to GCP Grey on youtube. I absolutely think that an alternate voting system would alleviate some of the more egregious drawbacks of the current system, especially the exclusion of third party candidates and the Spoiler Effect. I think that if we were able to somehow move some Libertarian legislators into low level state and or city branches and change the voting system locally, it might gain traction and maybe (big maybe) be implemented at a higher level. \n\nI would like to hear if anyone else shares my views or has some insight as to the efficacy of these other systems and how they may or may not align with Libertarian views.\n\nA decent explanation of different voting practices can be found here:\n https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNCHVwtpeBY4mybPkHEnRxSOb7FQ2vF9c"

It was super solid. But then i got stuck at Chapter 6 or 7. I lost interest. I started playing it again recently and oh boy was it fun after i finally learnt how to effectively use the pair up mechanic. I guess that's why i got stuck in the first place. \n\nI don't want to start Path of Radiance and do the same with it. If i grab it and lose interest because i got stuck, i might not be very willing to go back to it (it's older and less visually impressive. The 2D art on awakening was amazing to me for some reason.) \n\nFates seems like the obvious choice from a gameplay standpoint. But i didn't like that Fates has moving structures which i believe that you need to use in combat? It's story is said to be garbage too. I am a bit lost.",

Nor did i use any dancers for that matter (Olivia). If a unit is weak and need to be protected, they seem more like liability than a an asset to my roster. I could very well use another unit that can offer me more offensive power. I only used Gaius to solely open chests. Then i used Anna. I would always use her in levels because i could always pair her up with another character and not worry about her being weak. Although i could always not use her. \n\nAnd now in PoE i learnt that you can steal items from enemy units with thieves? Is it worth it? And same with dancers. \n\nTLDR: Do i use thiefs in every battle and level them up, or do i use them only for chapters with chests?"

I'm disappointed, but maybe this is par for the course? \n\nI  told her that I have some anxiety around ending up alone, and that I kind of panic at the thought of letting go of the \"Big Romantic Happy Ending^(TM)\" I've had on a pedestal since childhood. I fully expected her to do the detached \"mmhmm, OK we can address that\" thing she had done for every other topic, but this time she hit me with everyone's favorite line:  \"...but have you considered that you just haven't met the right person yet?\" \n\nNow I'm new-ish to the community, but I...know, you know? I pushed back a few times, hoping this was a misunderstanding. Maybe she thought I was  younger than I was. Or maybe she assumed I didn't really understand the label. Whatever she thought, she kept arguing with me so I dropped it. \n\nI'm usually pretty good at letting this stuff slide (I've had this conversation plenty of times lol) but I really couldn't control my face after that exchange. I couldn't stop wondering if \"ace\" wasn't included in the \"sexuality and gender\" bullet point she had listed on her bio as a therapy topic she's equipped to handle.\n\nMy question for the community: What should I realistically expect from a talk therapist when it comes to ace-related matters in the year of our lord 2021?\n\nConsidering the scarcity of affordable/available therapists in general, I'm prepared to resign myself to educating my therapist on this one thing...but should I have to? I'm not usually this quick to bail on anything that requires multiple appointments over time -- I understand that not everyone clicks on the first session -- but this feels like a bit of a red flag.  I think I could talk to her about other things but this is pretty big for me.\n\n**TL;DR:**  My new therapist seems to either doubt my understanding of my own sexuality or potentially doesn't know the basics of asexuality at all. I don't know if it's worth trying to convince/educate her. Is the psychology world at a point where we should expect therapists (who specifically state that they're experienced in sexuality topics) to have a basic grasp of what it means to be ace? Or is this what it's like across the board and I should just deal with it?\n\nI've been sitting and stewing for a week and a half and could really use some outside thoughts before my next session on Friday.

For one thing, they're fraternal triplets. Fraternal multiples are very common with IVF because they implant several embryos in the hopes at least one will make it, and often two or three or more do. And given most characters' surname is something to do with their breed, it's likely Terrier is their surname, but at least one of their biological parents was a schnauzer. They might have a single mum or same sex parents who used a schnauzer donor. Or either of their parents might be infertile so they used a schnauzer donor or surrogate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts?"

Trouble was, going back to fort dawnguard would aggro everyone. (I was at the moth priest quest). I wanted to reset dawnguard. After tinkering about, I found an easy solution. \n\n1. Save your game. Use this as a backup in case things go awry. (Ie: save1)\n\n2. Close the game, go to your game files, and rename the dawnguard.esm file. I chose to use the read only tag. (Ie: #dawnguard.esm)\n\n3. Open the game. Load your save (ie: save1). Create a new save (ie: save2). Close the game\n\n4. Change the name of the dawnguard.esm file back to it's original.\n\n5. Open the game with the second save file (ie: save2)\n\nDawnguard should have completely reset. If you were a vampire prior, you would still be, as vampirism is a vanilla game thing. You can go to morthal to fix that. I've played 2 hours thereafter and restarted the dawnguard quests to no bugs or glitches. It seems to have worked fine.\n\nCaveat: if you have any mods relating to vampirism, those have to be disabled first, or you'll end up with ghost scripts which may cause glitches. \n\nFor the concerned, I understand how quest progression is \"baked\" into the save file. But it appears that the save file is more of a 'savestate' kinda thing, where it records your progress and interactions along some boolean-like system. (Ie: quest1.progress - y/n) by saving without the \"DLC\", those lines seem to be eliminated. So when rebooting with the DLC, the game simply rewrites those lines. I assume Bethesda did this to accommodate OG skyrim players who bought the DLCs much later and wanted to play on with their current character. I've no idea if it works for vanilla quests. For the record, I've never modded skyrim, I was just basing the ideas off how Minecraft ran when I was writing mods for it in beta. It was kinda a gamble which worked. So people who've written mods for skyrim, do lmk. Would love to write mods for it someday.\n\nTL;DR: No to vampires. Found a way to reset dawnguard"

The Anarchist Library is a great site to find relevant works.

I have always been interested in cognitive disability from a philosophical perspective as I have been diagnosed with ASD, so I think this predisposed me to be curious about it. I really enjoyed reading work by Kittay, McMahan and others on moral status, personhood and justice, but I was thinking for my dissertation I might look at this topic from the angle of moral responsibility rather than moral status. What precisely makes someone morally responsible for their actions? How do we draw the lines with regard to cognitive disabilities? Might this affect how we view the moral culpability of animals? What relationship does this have to moral status? And what might this reveal about the nature of morality itself? These kinds of questions.\n\nObviously I'd like to do some more reading to figure out how I want to approach this. But I often have trouble figuring out what the influential works are in a particular philosophical topic. So, I'd love some recommendations of influential authors, essays etc. dealing with this and related topics. It honestly doesn't have to be too specific as I am just gathering at this stage. I just want a bit of an idea of which authors and papers are leading the discussions. Thanks in advance!"

She shared it to let the other workers know where they could get more information about their working rights in case they were curious. The reason the topic was brought up is because they were not given payslips for that week, although this issue was later fixed.\n\nShe also shared a link to the SDA on her personal Instagram story to talk more generally to her peers about making sure they are aware of their working rights.\n\nFast forward to today, she goes in to work and one of the other workers has screenshotted both the snapchat message and the instagram story and sent it to the manager. The store manager then took my sister into the office and literally yelled at her for doing this. She said since my sister is not a parent, guardian, manager or official union representative that she should not be sharing this information because it \"disparages the store\" and makes workers \"look for things to complain about.\"\n\nThis is obviously not a thing as far as I'm aware, so what can we do to get back at them and make it clear that this is really fucked up? Is this actually illegal to use a worker's personal information against them, and could this constitute a threat in any way? My sister says she felt like she was being threatened and like her manager was being aggressive. Appreciate any contributions you might have!"

I am so surprised at the difference it has made but truly it has been life changing. After struggling with vaginismus for over 8 years and making some but not much progress with dilators, physio and sex therapy I was getting frustrated. But 6 weeks ago i started committing to a daily yoga practice just for my fitness, and the most surprising benefit i have experienced is my vaginismus almost going away completely. During my practice I have focused a lot on deep breathing and relaxing into the breath, as well as being aware of my pelvic floor. I had sex with my partner a couple of weeks after I started doing yoga everyday and instead of being an 8/10 pain as usual it was literally like 2/10, since then we have had sex a bunch of times and its so much better. \n\nIf you have trouble with directly practising using dilators like me (demand avoidance), I can't recommend yoga enough. I literally feel pretty much cured and I have had so much fun doing it as well as reaping many other benefits.\n\nEdit: Since a few comments asked about it, I've elaborated about my routine below:\n\nI actually mostly attend classes near my house so the routine is different each time. However most of these classes are vinyasa style, so they are arranged around the vinyasa flow and focus a lot on sun salutations, lunges, warrior poses and tend to be fairly strenuous. I also attend 2 hatha yoga classes each week which are less strength focused but are strenuous on my balance and flexibility. I also practice using online classes twice a week and often follow Yoga with Adriene videos. I especially like her root chakra and hip opening practices, I think these would be super helpful for people with vaginismus. The key focus is just to focus on breathing deeply into the stomach through the nose, and relaxing into the postures. I also try to keep my pelvic floor aware and lifted in each pose, and then completely relaxed in resting poses/shivasana.\n\nIn terms of poses that I think are beneficial and try to practice a lot, I do a lot of warrior poses and lunges which I think helps to strengthen my pelvic floor and open my hips. I also focus on breathing steadily even in strenuous poses such as plank and bridge, so it's helping me to learn to relax even when tense if that makes sense. I think this has been hugely beneficial. I also think holding poses such as yogic squat, happy baby pose, triangle pose, pigeon pose and lizard pose are good ones for vaginismusas they promote awareness of the pelvic area.\n\nI hope this helps!"

I'm slim, tall, and dark-skinned, living in Switzerland.\n\nI already took several MBTI tests.\n\nGot INFP on my first test ever which was about almost about 2 years ago, took the test again several months later and got ENFP but I was very depressed back then, after recovering about 6 months later I got typed as an INFJ I related to the INFJ type the most and am pretty sure that I'm an INXJ. And today I got typed as INTJ 2 times! So yeah hope yall can give me some clarification here!\n\n***\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?***\n\nNot medical but since I've had a traumatic childhood because my mother used to be very toxic towards me and my siblings, for example, punishing me and my sister for no reason. My mother passed away unexpectedly last year which caused me to be very very depressed, I learned to move on from the past, which means I'm feeling a lot better now.\n\nBut I'm pretty sure I would be diagnosed with something.\n\n***\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?***\n\nMy childhood at the beginning was very peaceful until I reached the age of 6 or 7.\n\nLike mentioned my mother used to beat us regularly for no or very minor reasons, I used to deal with that by just running away or ignoring her.  My Stepdad was a good guy, but always very busy working, which left me without a real male role model to look up to and no support. I was always so happy to do something with my dad but we never really had a meaningful conversation. This went on until my parents divorced, from there on I started living with my dad while visiting my mom on the weekend, even though our relationship was ruined. (I was 7 when this happened.)\n\nMy dad spoiled me, gave me everything I wanted, but never actually had time for me. Which left me disappointed and playing video games all day, because I got bullied in school and had no friends.\n\nIt wasn't always like that I used to be one of the most popular kids in school until my parents divorced that's when I started to get bullied. It probably was because of suppressing the emotions that I had towards my mother, so I started to act weird around my friends (they were the cool kids btw.), which caused them to ghost and bully me until the second year of high school. After that, I was starting to be way more reserved, I was scarred by trust issues because of my best friends turning on me and making me feel like an outsider. They were the only ones I really could have fun with. (was probably 14, When I got accepted again.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?***\n\nI started an apprenticeship as logistician. I really liked it at the beginning because it was a new world. But after 3 years I started to dislike the idea of working for someone because I saw another guy who worked in the office making millions with cryptocurrencies, he's a good friend of mine now. He showed me that it's possible to be self-made.\n\nI always had a dream of being a huge musician back then, but that was the moment where I realized you can make money without working for someone which shifted my whole paradigm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?***\n\nI do it almost all the time, I like spending time with myself. But I sometimes start to feel lonely when no ones reaching out to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?***\n\nI used to go to the gym regularly but was always athletic as a kid too since I had a lot of energy.  This habit faded away after the passing of my mother. I barricaded myself and started to learn how to produce music since I desire to make a living with making music, and that is a dream of mine. I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking in nature or playing basketball sometimes, I work out at home sometimes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?***\n\nThe only thing I always ask myself is, where will I be in 5 years from now on?\n\nRight now, more conceptual since I'm always learning something new in music production and didn't reach my goal in that particular skill. But my bigger vision is to be influential and help a lot of people, I don't want to be a personal coach or something like that, I'd rather dig into the masses and maybe change a lot of individuals life for the better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?***\n\nYes. I'd love to. I want to be inspiring and do something no one has ever done before.\n\nI would say my style would be by letting my actions speak, and actually do something that no one ever has done before, and maybe some people will jump on that train.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.***\n\nYes, I'm a Music Producer and singer/rapper.\n\n***\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?***\n\nI deal with the past by asking myself, why it turned out like that, and with the present by doing what it takes to get to my goal, and with the future by trusting a higher power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?***\n\nMostly because they are friends, and showed they're loyal in some type of way.\n\n***\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?***\n\nOh yes!\n\n***\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?***\n\nIt got very important for me this year.\n\n***\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?***\n\nI mostly know, what kind of motivation people have so, by finding a win-win situation for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?***\n\nMusic is my main hobby because I can fully be myself, while giving people an experience that they wont forget so fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?***\n\nBeing entertaining, and being the best version of myself.\n\n***\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?***\n\nBetrayal, Liars, people taking advantage of their higher position, and bullies.\n\nAll because it's just negative and won't do better to no one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?***\n\nPeople actually living up to my expectations, they are never 100%  met but a step seems to be enough for me.\n\n***\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?***\n\nThinking that the people are doubting me and what I'm capable of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?***\n\nYeah, I daydream a lot, and I am aware of my surroundings when I have to be, for example when I'm at work.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI would think something like, will I ever be able to experience a good emotion like that?\n\n***\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?***\n\nIt takes a long time, sometimes days or months. But I never change my mind once I made it.\n\n***\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?***\n\nActually I don't even know too much about my emotions, it's weird.\n\nI cried once in 4 years, and that was when my mother passed since then I sometimes tear up for no reason. They are important but I'm always confused when I'm thinking about my emotions.\n\n***\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?***\n\nNot directly. I don't agree to keep it going. I'll just shut up nod my head, and let them talk, then end the conversation or steer it in a different direction when they're done talking.\n\n***\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?***\n\nI never purposefully broke rules. But everybody should be challenged since there's always a better concept or idea.\n\nBut I would break rules when it's in the way of achieving something I want to happen, but there are levels to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally done, had a blast answering.\n\nLooking forward to your responses!"

My rogues aren't broody and aren't urchins, my cleric isn't kind and nurturing, my barbarian has anxiety and was actually raised by scholarly parents, etc. \n\nMy problem with monks is...From the class' descriptions in the books, it seems so restricting to me. Does a monk *have* to have trained in a monastery or under a master? Couldn't my monk be self taught in a, for example, street brawler type of scenario? I'm having a hard time coming up with a creative twist on the concept of a monk that involes training in a monastery, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas or if anyone wanted to share their opinion vis-\u00e0-vis the option of a self-taught monk? \n\nThanks in advance."

Are there any skills, feats, races, etc. that would help me with such a build?

The girl took their eyes and placed them inside a jar so they could watch for intruders.\n\nShe took her best knife from the table and sliced a portion from one of the children's limbs.\n\n\u201cMother, shall be proud for I, her little girl, is bringing food at home!\u201d\n\nThe girl went home with the limb in a sack and prided herself on her old mother.\n\nThe old mother kissed the girl and cooked the limb for dinner. \n\n\u201cDaughter, there will be guests tomorrow, eager to know their fate.\u201d The mother was a seer in their town. \u201cPrepare the same meat for them and go home.\u201d \n\nThe girl went to her cabin and sliced the other children's limb, bigger than the last.\n\nTwo guests were sitting around the table when the girl entered. The woman whispered to her husband how dingy and unpresentable the old mother's house is, and the dinner for them was late. The husband agreed. The girl heard all of this and sharpened her scythe at the toolshed. \n\nShe overheard her mother telling them their fortune.\n\u201cYou will have long lives, and beautiful children that will manage your riches.\u201d\n\nThe couple never made it home to celebrate their fate.\n\nThe girl went to her cabin and butchered two more bodies clean and stacked them on the table. She sliced the fresh limb from the man and asked her mother to cook it.\n\nThe mother remarked their scrumptious meal and said, \u201cDaughter, there will be no guests tomorrow. Bring the same meat twice the portion of the one you brought and we shall celebrate.\u201d\n\nThe girl obliged, going back and forth to her cabin and to home. Her oblivious mother cheered at the luxurious meal every day, and thought to herself \u201cI won't work as a seer anymore for my daughter bring me goods.\u201d\n\nOne day, the daughter went to her cabin and found it empty. The blood from the barrel was drained for her mother cooked it too.\n\n\u201cMy mother has betrayed me and reduced my collection to nothing!\u201d\n\nThe girl loved her collection very much and went mad.\n\nSo the girl went home and instantly her mother asked for the meat, looking upon her empty hands.\n\u201cI can't bring meat tonight for you, mother. But I can feed myself.\u201d\n\nThe girl raised her scythe and sliced her mother in two.\n\nThe little girl stacked the pieces on the table, put some of the meat in her broth and felt content with the meat she could cook for the following day."

Similarly, if you go into a movie with certain expectations you might not enjoy it.\n\nPersonally I like it because it's very, very beautiful, and a lot of the scenes represent things that are so universal to the human experience (playing in the grass as a child, your parents fighting). Seeing them portrayed in such a candid way was really moving and because the movie in a way is *about love and joy*, I didn't need a cohesive plot.",

Mankind divided does, as you say, use its quests to feedback into a very central theme of identity, but I do think the writing, in terms of quality, was much better in the games predecessor, human revolution. It makes me kinda sad because it feels like a lot of plot elements and characters from the previous games story were scrapped or abandoned.\n\nHuman revolution was one off my favorite gaming experiences as a teen and really left an imprint on me in terms of what an fps RPG could accomplish. In contrast to human revolutions 4 or so endings, mankind divided felt awkward and clumsy in its execution of its themes. Even the dialogue doesn't hit as great! \n\nMaybe it's just me, but I think human revolution explored muchmore interesting questions than mankind divided, and the whole \"discrimination\" thing the latter tried to pull of didn't quite land, even if the world and people it takes place in are captivating. A lot of the discrimination that takes place in the game feels very shallow and lacks nuance, although that is made up for in some side quests.

I'm 23 and have always sported a light beard, but problem is, I've never really learned how to use a razor well on my face; I've always stuck with my beard trimmer as I never needed to go shorter.\n\nI bought a safety razor to get a closer shave, but my first time around yielded poor results and some irritated skin. I'm looking to currently buy some shaving cream (apparently Aerosol shaving foam is bad for you?) but I'm not sure where to start. It looks like I should buy something that \\*isn't\\* in a can, but the cheapest thing I can find is cremo: \n\n[https://www.amazon.ca/Cremo-Cooling-smooth-shaving-fights/dp/B087DZPX74/ref=sr\\_1\\_6?dchild=1&keywords=shaving+cream&qid=1618350787&sr=8-6](https://www.amazon.ca/Cremo-Cooling-smooth-shaving-fights/dp/B087DZPX74/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=shaving+cream&qid=1618350787&sr=8-6)\n\nIs this good? Should I go with something else? I'd like to get in the habit of regularly shaving my face but tbh I'm a little intimidated by the safety razor I bought. Any suggestions/reccomendations? I'm looking to keep my price down. What sort of facial/body shaving routine do you guys have?"

                "body": "So this is something I've been trying to figure out for the last two months, and the TL;Dr of it is that my Dad has never really been a 'parent' to me in any sense beyond providing for me. He almost certainly has undiagnosed autism, which I believe has given him lifelong struggles in understanding many elements of people and relationships.\n\nI guess this is hard to write from a perspective that isn't solely frustration, but suffice it to say neither of my parents were great, I'm no-contact with my other parent (only recently, in the last 2 years), but growing up as a child, and particularly a teenager, my father had very little ability for...I don't know what to call it but emotional comprehension. He just doesn't understand people very well, and that emotional intelligence just really isn't there. Like really really. He misses on a lot of social cues, ect, for example.\n\nSo, I ended up missing out on a lot of that 'parent' experience that a lot of people got, despite actually having a father in the house, it's always felt a bit more like a pseudo-parental relationship. This was really hard for me as a child and teenager because I didn't get any sort of good emotional guidance from *either* of my parents, but from my Dad there was practically none. He was never able to provide advice or role-modeling for interpersonal situations, often having a very neutral stance or looking at things in a black & white way.  He did not raise me very much, and I sorta half-raised myself and now I see a therapist. This isn't to blame all my problems on him, because I don't, but...this has had a lifelong impact. It often feels like I never had a 'real' dad. \n\nMy mom did pick up on it and they eventually got a divorce, partially due to unrelated reasons but I think the lack emotional intelligence made her feel misunderstood. But I'm pretty sure she told him about it, and I recently pointed it out to him in november or so, but he had very little interest in talking about it and didn't seem to care much for it. He isn't very interested in learning about it or how it may be affecting his life. It's really frustrating because I'm not sure how aware of these issues he is.\n\nWhile a lot of this stuff is directly due to his autism, the impact this left has really been weighing on me and I haven't talked to him since Christmas as a result. I told him I needed some time, but this has all been hard to put into words, especially in a way that he will understand. I'd like to figure out a way to convey this to my dad, and also that I'd like him to read some books on autism and maybe see a therapist once a month. \n\nI'm wondering if anyone has any advice on this? I apologize if this post in any way offends someone, and please let me know if I have written something that's offensive or incorrect and I will edit the post.  I am doing my best to be mindful about this situation. I feel like I should add, I do not resent my Dad in any way for having autism, and I would never change who he is, and I love him for who he is. That being said, he's never been able to be much of a parent to me, and I feel like I deserve to express how I feel about that, and I'd like to encourage him to access resources that could improve his ability to understand people and navigate relationships."

For about three years Jay and I have been ENM with the boundary being to only have threesomes and shared activities. Jay had a cucking fetish and thought it would be hot if my best friend Dan were interested in having a threesome with us. He agreed, but before that ever happened, Jay brought up the idea that it would be hot if just Dan and I slept together and I was into the idea also, so we did. \n\nIt was amazing and Jay stated he was okay with whatever I did with Dan. I had gotten caught up in NRE and became Dans sub and failed to communicate this with Jay. Jay hated the D/s dynamic between Dan and I, but said he was okay with it because it made me happy. Jay decided he no longer is into being cucked but yet he would request videos of Dan and I fucking because \"sometimes\" he was into it and sometimes not. Jay and I have mismatched libidos, mine being very high and his being very low. The only time we had sex is if I initiated.\n\nJay had a short term dynamic with a person and due to them feeling they cannot communicate with me, they stopped talking to this person. \n\nThe dynamic I have with Dan is flourishing and that makes Jay upset. He is still holding onto resentment and constantly tells me that if he had known months ago that I would become Dan's sub, he would have never agreed. \n\nJay and I have had horrible communication issues over the years and it has only gotten worse. Lots of stonewalling from Jay for years and no therapy on his end. So when discussing pressing matters he becomes completely silent, stares out, and becomes non verbal. I told him he had to improve or else I will leave. Otherwise we get along really well. Jay keeps flip flopping his feelings and had told me he is ultimately unsure of how he feels about being non monogamous in general. He stated he is NOT monogamous.\n\nThe dynamic with my best friend Dan and I is beautiful and he sees Jay as his partner also. (They sometimes kiss, do sexual things when i am present and talk a lot). \n\nAny advice on how to repair things with Jay while keeping my dynamic with Dan?\n\nEdit: I give Jay a lot of reassurance and treat the dynamics in a parallel fashion. Sometimes he asks for hot details between Dan and I. Whenever I hang out with Dan,  Jay has an emotional meltdown."

                "body": "Okay, so, everyone says that you won't ever use your AP classes after you've finished them unless you're going to work in that specific field, right? Well, that's not always the case. You see, I needed to finish this online government class this week in order to graduate. The only thing standing between me and my diploma was this 7 page paper asking me to assess the quote unquote \"balance\" of the American government system. Well, I needed a way to fill up space--fast. I didn't know enough philosophical government jargon to fill it with that (heck, I probably couldn't write more than a paragraph using the information I learned in that good-for-nothing course), so I opted for the analogy route. Naturally, I compared the US to an acid base reaction where democracy is a buffer solution. Basically, I said US politics doesn't shift too much everytime a new president gets into office (like how the pH would change super quick without a buffer) because checks and balances and stuff (like buffer solutions) keep things from shifting too far from the norm until a serious amount of change occurs in the population (like when the moles of OH- or H+ ions exceed the buffers capacity). In the end I wrote four thick paragraphs explaining how acid base reactions work and how it's just like the government, which meant that I succeeded in including very few sensible arguments in my essay. And people say AP Chemistry is useless in everyday life! \n\nThanks for listening to my Ted Talk."

It went great! (Relatively speaking), I love the person and we are still friends and they made me feel great (physically) but I hated the whole experience.

No emotion nor enjoyment, I just wanted to be over with it so I could go back to whatever I was doing before. \n\nBut after that whole ordeal was over I kinda felt... weird...\nThe only way I can describe the feeling is, the feeling you get when you unlock something in a videogame and you think \"oh this might open a door I wasn't able to enter in a past level\". \nAnd this said doors are the previous hints that I was probably ace. \n\nNow typing it out it sounds weirder than in my head but that's how I feel ig. \n\n\nAnyway, thanks for listening and have a good whatever is happening in the sky at that point in time"

Understandably they were most likely hungry but their mood stood out to me as it was the labour day which is associated with mad partying, sugary sweets and uncharacteristically goofy behaviour here in Finland. Probably very nice to be starving when everybody is having the best sugar high of the year or drunk off their ass. Usually both tho. \n\nThis is quite meaningless little thing but  once more I really respect all of you and the incredible perseverance many of you portray.

I hope my comment can be constructive for you in some way.\n\nThis is a hard pill to swallow, and I am not saying any of this with ill intent, but she\u2019s gone. You need to accept that and move forward. You hurt her, and the price you are paying is losing her. If you truly love and respect her, you will acknowledge that she deserves peace from what you did, which can only come if you let her go. This is the responsibility you must take, no matter how hard it is for you. You owe it to her.\n\nMy advice to you is to see this as a serious life lesson. Take this experience and use it as a pivotal moment in your life to improve yourself. The first step towards improving yourself is taking responsibility. Accept that you made a mistake, acknowledge that it was unacceptable, and let your ex go as the price you are paying for it. Once you have done this, you can begin working on yourself to ensure it never happens again.\n\nHow do you work on yourself effectively? Remember this experience as a low point that you never wish to stoop to again. Prove to yourself through your actions going forward that this experience does not define you as a person, and treat this as a big stepping stone to a better you. That way when you meet another girl to fall in love with, you will be confident that you can give her everything she deserves. You can use this as fuel to improve as well, but make sure the improvement is primarily for you. Eventually, you will also be able to forgive yourself, as you will no longer be the person you were when you cheated. You will have evolved into someone who is capable of giving the person they love everything they deserve in the world.\n\nDespite your actions, I see hope for you. The fact that you feel extremely guilty and know it was a huge mistake is a sign that you are willing to grow from this experience. Sometimes mistakes like this need to happen in order for us to become better as people. It\u2019s not the mistake that defines us, it\u2019s how we choose to go about moving forward from the mistake. What will you choose going forward?\n\nI hope this helps. Good luck OP.",

I felt like I was at rock bottom because he was the only thing I still valued in my life. I was completely lost when he left, and I had no idea what my future was going to bring.\n\nBut I also had a moment with myself when this happened. I thought to myself that the only way for me to get past this is if I improve myself and my life to the point to where I can look back and think, \u201cThank god he broke up with me.\u201d It was my personal revenge for him leaving me.\n\nI channeled all of my negative feelings from the breakup into my career, and today, I was offered my dream job. After about a year and a half of refusing to remain at my rock bottom, I have achieved something I have been striving to achieve my whole life.\n\nSo now, I can finally say it: thank god my ex broke up with me. Because if he didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have achieved what I just achieved today.\n\nYou have a choice in this matter. You can choose to remain sad, wish your relationship didn\u2019t end and ultimately remain apathetic in your current situation. Or, you can choose to use the situation as fuel to better yourself and get yourself to a place to where you are happy without them. You\u2019d be surprised how well heartbreak works as fuel towards improving yourself.\n\nKeep going. As someone who has struggled with moving on from their ex long-term, I can assure you that it gets better so long as you never stop trying to improve yourself and your life."

                "body": "So here\u2019s the context. I have an ex from late high school/early college that I haven\u2019t spoken to in about 6 years. This was a very dysfunctional relationship, and he did a lot of very hurtful and manipulative things to me. I didn\u2019t respond well to these things and said and did things that were harmful to him as well. We were off and on for 2 years (2011-2013), then I became very distant from him after we broke up because he continued to do hurtful and manipulative things even when we tried to be friends. I told him I wanted to be strictly friends in 2014, and he strongly protested this, saying hooking up is no big deal and that he didn\u2019t understand why we couldn\u2019t. This eventually led to him sexually assaulting me towards the end of that year when we were drunk together one night, which put even more distance between me and him. I grew very short and cold with him anytime he tried to talk to me after that, and this went on for a couple of years.\n\nThen, at the end of 2016, I received a voicemail from him in the middle of the night. It was a few minutes long, and he was clearly either intoxicated or high on something. He was calling me a dumb ass, saying I\u2019m the most immature person he\u2019s ever met, and that I treat him like a stranger. After receiving this voicemail, I sent him a message stating that if he ever tried to contact me again, I would report him to the authorities and use the voicemail as evidence against him. We haven\u2019t spoken since.\n\nWell, he reached out this last March. He sent me a message asking how I was, apologizing for the past, and asking if I would be interested in grabbing a cup of coffee to catch up. My first initial reaction was basically \u201cscrew you,\u201d so I left him on read. But there is a part of me that wants to believe that we\u2019ve both grown since then, since this was years ago.\n\nI want to mention that I have no interest in starting things up with him again or even rekindling a friendship. It would just be this one meet up where we can talk about the past and hopefully take responsibility for some things we did and said, then go our separate ways. If I were to respond to him, I would communicate this to him before any possibility of meeting up. And if he isn\u2019t cool with that, back to no contact.\n\nI also want to mention that I am much stronger than I was back then. So if he tries to persuade me to do anything I don\u2019t want to do, I have absolutely no problems just getting up and walking out. If I find that he hasn\u2019t grown the way I hope he has and isn\u2019t able to speak maturely about things, I will simply walk out and go back to no contact like I was doing before.\n\nAnytime I consider something like this, I always ask myself, what do I have to gain from doing this? Will this be helpful? Will this hurt me in any way? And what I believe I have to gain from this is putting the past to bed. I carry a lot of what he did to me with me, and if we are able to sit down and have a civil and mature discussion about what happened in the past and own up to our mistakes, I think it would help me gain some peace of mind. We were both young and dumb, so it\u2019s possible we\u2019ve both grown since then.\n\nWhat do you think?"

                "body": "I was reminiscing on the relationship I had with my ex last night by watching a bunch of old Snapchat videos of us. I know that\u2019s probably not a super smart thing to do, but it was a bit different this time. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve allowed myself to watch any of those things that I was sort of watching them from an objective standpoint rather than from my own perspective. And I\u2019m finally beginning to understand why it has been taking me so long to get over this.\n\nOur chemistry was literally perfect. We clicked like I\u2019ve never clicked with anyone before. We never fought for the 3 and a half years we were together. But I was so wrapped up in my own shit going on in my life that I couldn\u2019t love my ex the way he deserved to be loved. I didn\u2019t know what direction I wanted to head into for my career, and I was being heavily pushed down a path I didn\u2019t want to go down that would eventually require me to move out of state. I didn\u2019t have the guts to put my foot down and tell my mentors at the time that I am not doing what they wanted me to do, so I just put my head down and continued down that path. My ex stopped feeling like there was a future with me because he couldn\u2019t move away with me, became disconnected, and broke up with me.\n\nI\u2019ve spent so much time being upset with how he went about the end of our relationship that it didn\u2019t click until last night where I lacked in the relationship. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted in my life, and that was affecting how my ex saw our future. My grad school years were also some of the most brutal years of my life, which made me emotionally unavailable for the entirety of our relationship. I wasn\u2019t ready to step up and be the partner my ex deserves, because I still had a lot of things in my own life to figure out.\n\nThe breakup rattled me more than anything has rattled me in my life. It was a wake up call, and I\u2019ve turned my life around because of it. I put my foot down and told my mentors that I am deciding my own future for myself, and since doing that, my career has launched. I have made some incredible achievements, and my passion for what I do has come back. I love my work, and it is because I finally had the courage to step up and defend my wants and desires for my life. And because of all this, I am no longer emotionally numb from putting up huge walls from my grad school years. I have grown tremendously, and though I am still continuing to better myself, the difference between now and a year ago is already substantial.\n\nFor the longest time, I haven\u2019t quite fully understood why he left. I thought I needed to get over the pain he caused me when he broke up with me to finally move forward, but I\u2019m realizing that maybe I\u2019ve felt stuck for so long because I haven\u2019t acknowledged where I was lacking in the relationship. I was just going through the motions in my life because I had felt so beat down from my own shit, and that behavior was bleeding into my relationship. It wasn\u2019t until my relationship ended that I realized things needed to change.\n\nWatching these old Snapchat videos, I realize that my ex isn\u2019t the terrible person I\u2019ve convinced myself to believe that he is to help cope with the pain of losing him. He is quite the opposite: a loving, caring, generous individual that needed to make decisions for himself because of where I was in my life. I think in order for me to truly move forward, I need to acknowledge that I wasn\u2019t ready for the responsibilities that come with being in a serious relationship and loving someone. I couldn\u2019t be there like he needed me to be there, and I need to forgive myself for that. Perhaps then I can truly feel at peace with all of this.\n\nDo any of you have any thoughts about this or similar experiences where you needed to forgive yourself to move forward? How did you do it? I tend to be incredibly hard on myself, especially when it comes to other people\u2019s lives and emotions, so it\u2019s difficult for me to let these kinds of things go.\n\nThank you for making it to the end if you did. As usual, this post is way longer than I originally intended."

                "body": "I originally posted this in the r/ExNoContact subreddit, then realized this is probably a more appropriate place to post this.\n\nNormally when I\u2019ve dreamt about my ex in the past, he\u2019ll be with someone new, he\u2019ll be acting differently than I remember him which would cause me to question who he really is, or he wouldn\u2019t even be in the dream but I would be engaging in an activity alone that we would normally do together and miss him. I\u2019d always feel hurt in the dream and wake up feeling that pain.\n\nBut this time was different. In my dream just now I was walking to the bus stop, and when I got there, my ex was also at the bus stop waiting for the bus. He saw me, said hi very kindly and made some small talk with me. He seemed happy to see me and was very friendly and sweet, which is the person I remember him to be when we were together. I noticed he was wearing jeans, which is something he never wore when we were together because he didn\u2019t like jeans. A couple of minutes later his bus came, and as he was getting on it he said, \u201cI hope all is well with you.\u201d And that was that.\n\nI noticed the way I responded to this in the dream was very nonchalant. I responded to him very neutrally, not really feeling much of anything. I was friendly, but my guard was up. He seemed more enthusiastic about seeing me than I was about him.\n\nNormally I don\u2019t speculate about the meanings of dreams. They\u2019re normally very random and chaotic for me, usually making no sense, so I almost never try to put meaning behind dreams. But when I dream about something that is directly related to something I\u2019m going through in my life, I can\u2019t help but feel like it might be a hint as to where I truly stand in my subconscious on that specific matter. This dream with my ex was far different than any other dream I\u2019ve had about him. It was friendly, casual, and most importantly, peaceful. I didn\u2019t feel anything negative towards him when talking to him, and the dream reminded me of the good in his character. And as small of a detail as it is, him wearing jeans tells me that things change and evolve for the better. He\u2019s not the same person today as the person I knew over a year ago, and that doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t honest with who he was when we were together.\n\nWhen we first broke up, I often told people that he\u2019s a wonderful person that made mistakes. I held this mindset until 2 or 3 months into our breakup, when I realized just how much he had hurt me. That\u2019s when I finally gave myself permission to be mad at him, and those negative feelings have been brewing for almost a year now. This dream reminded me of the mindset that I used to have when we first broke up. It reminded me that he is a kind and generous soul, and he knows he hurt me. He knows he made mistakes. He knows he wasn\u2019t a good partner to me towards the end of our relationship. He even sought out therapy after we broke up for the things he did wrong in our relationship. He admitted to all of this when we were forced to live out the remainder of our lease together after breaking up.\n\nI do miss him after having this dream. But do I feel pain? No. Are there any negative feelings attached to this dream? No. This is why I feel like there might be some meaning to this. I think it\u2019s a sign that I might be finally making peace with all of this, after over a year. Finally accepting everything that happened. Finally accepting that he truly is a wonderful person that is not perfect and made mistakes.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m gonna be okay."

                "body": "Hello everyone. I\u2019ve never posted in this group before, but I\u2019ve posted and interacted in the r/heartbreak subreddit a good amount. I just wanted to share the things I\u2019ve been going through and struggling with. Perhaps someone can relate or has any advice as to what else I could do to finally heal. This post might be a bit on the longer side, so thank you if you\u2019ve taken the time to make it to the end.\n\nMy ex and I broke up over a year ago. We were together 3 and a half years and were living together when we broke up. You could say our breakup was sudden, though we knew we were having issues in the few months leading up to it. He broke up with me, and it completely shocked me. Though I knew we were having problems, I never for a second thought we would break up over them. I thought we would be able to work through them, but my ex felt differently it seems.\n\nWhat really destroyed me about this was that my ex didn\u2019t really seem to put much effort into working on things. He was very much in his own head and didn\u2019t really share much with me unless I sat him down and spoke to him about it. He kept things from me as opposed to communicating with me about them, which led him to make decisions for our relationship without discussing anything with me first. He randomly told me one day that he wanted to move out, but then changed his mind the next day and said he wanted to work on things. He hardly put any effort into things over the next month though I noticed him trying to spend more time with me, then eventually broke up with me. The only reason I was given for him breaking up with me was, \u201cI feel a disconnect, I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t think I can be in a relationship right now.\u201d\n\nThis left me completely shattered and confused. We got along amazingly all the way up until this point, never even had a single fight. A month or two after breaking up (we still had to live out the remainder of the lease together), he told me the disconnect was because he didn\u2019t feel there was a future with me anymore because of what I do for work. What I do is very scarce on jobs, so it requires me to move around a lot. I had a good chance at getting a job that was a couple thousand miles away from where we live, and he was no longer willing to follow me and be with me.\n\nI completely understand that. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s far-fetched at all. It\u2019s a lot for me to ask him to drop everything he\u2019s doing in his own life to follow me around the country and be with me. But what confuses me is that I was beginning to figure out alternatives for my work so that I could stay where we currently live and be with him. We talked about this in the month leading up to our breakup, and he even asked if I would be willing to follow him to the other side of the country if he ever decided to move there for his career. I told him I would be happy to. He said this was just a hypothetical conversation, but why would he even bring this up if he didn\u2019t think there was a future with me?\n\nBecause of all this, it has made me question everything in what was seemingly a happy, healthy and functional relationship. What else was he not sharing with me? Why was I always the one to initiate the next step in our relationship? Why was I always the one to ask to sit down and have an honest and serious conversation about our relationship? Why was he able to walk away so easily?\n\nI\u2019ve never loved and trusted someone more in my life, and all of that feels shattered now. He\u2019s made me feel worthless and inadequate of properly meeting the needs of a partner, and therefore not deserving of someone who will fight to be with me. Sometimes I feel like I deserved better than his lack of effort in working on things, and other times I feel like it was exactly what I deserved.\n\nI\u2019ve dated and met some good people, but I don\u2019t know if I can properly give my all to a new person until I\u2019m completely healed from this. The problem is, at this point, I have no idea how to heal anymore. I\u2019ve tried basically everything except therapy because I can\u2019t afford it. I\u2019m just so emotionally exhausted from hurting and struggling. I want to be able to think about this and not have it negatively affect me anymore.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten myself to an incredible point in my career and feel like I have grown so much as a person. I am in a completely different place than I was a year ago when the breakup was still fresh. I have focused very hard on myself and my life and have made some incredible strides, but for some reason it feels as though I\u2019m still holding on to this. I can\u2019t let go of the hurt my ex has caused me.\n\nAt this point it just feels like a waiting game. How much longer is this going to take? What else can I possibly do to help me let this go? I haven\u2019t spoken to him or interacted with him at all since September, and I\u2019ve tried to use this negative energy as fuel towards bettering myself and my life. It has gotten me far, but the pain continues. When can I feel good about the place I\u2019ve been able to get myself to in my life without this lingering pain under the surface?\n\nI\u2019m so tired. I just want this to finally be over."

Well one of the instructors at my taekwondo school does that a lot, and usually I don't go to his classes for that exact reason, but I am trying to go every day because I want to test for my next belt.  Tonight, true to form he started correcting me numerous times so the entire class could hear, and I did what I usually do which is shut down and avoid eye contact, trying to tell him nonverbally to stop drawing all this attention to me.  Then once during class and once after he said \"I didn't mean to upset you\" -- *again*, in front of the entire class instead of just bringing me aside.\n\nI think the other students (most of them are kids) not really taking the class seriously also played a role, but I also think I really frustrated him because I am the highest ranked student and wasn't respecting him like I should.  He was kind of passive-aggressive by the end and telling the class that he'd just let them do whatever they wanted next time because they obviously didn't want to learn from him.  Which probably wouldn't have happened if I handled myself better or just did the smart thing and didn't go to class tonight.  AITA?"

He could just tell Gus he's a risk and Gus could make it look like an accident or like it's cartel action, it would make sense to the police that the cartel would have him killed since he's selling in what they think is the cartel's territory. So why doesn't he? We know he's willing to have friends killed to protect himself. I know it worked itself out in the end but there's no way Walt could have known that it would, so why does Jesse always get special treatment? Especially here when he's the biggest risk factor of yet."

That\u2019s all well and good but the issue is that in the movie he\u2019s always shown to have an Ni first bias when solving problems and even interacting with people, he also relies on Te methods for logical analysis, they specifically wrote him to be this way since it\u2019s how the real Hawking solved his problems. So why do people vote him to be an INTP? It\u2019s because he\u2019s an awkward, disheveled nerd character who\u2019s dorm room is kinda messy.

I have never met an ENTJ who couldn't almost immediately have every resource organized in the best spot possible, though again I might be bias, being cognitive siblings and all\n\nENTP- Always a joy to be around and always full of insight, the ENTP can out think pretty much any logical opponent, with their Ne branching into dozens even hundreds of possibilities and their Ti mulling over everything at once, they are able to think quickly or over long periods of time easily and effectively\n\nThis would be a fun discussion I think, so let me know your favorites."

I really want to play Breath of the Wild, but understand it falls at the end of one of the 3 split branches/its own continuity in general. I\u2019d rather not play it first if I\u2019ll be getting a better experience seeing all the games that led up to this masterpiece from what I keep hearing. Also I don\u2019t have to play every game in the franchise, but definitely wanting to try some of the major ones like OoT and ALttP"

For complete background as far as what all I listen to and inspired me to take this journey is a bunch of Lofi, Jazz Hop, Chill Hop, and then Dubstep to balance it all out. Some of my favorite artists include Ganja White Night, Burbank, Biskwiq, and Galdive to name a few. Overall I would love to learn how to make music very similar to the styles they play and give my own take on the music I play. I took my first step and am going back to school after many failed attempts at taking basic classes, as I\u2019ve officially signed up for Music Theory. My knowledge as far as how music is made is at the absolute lowest level you could imagine, but there\u2019s no time like the present I suppose. Eventually I would like to learn how to play a few instruments starting with Piano/Midi Keyboard, and Bass, and even learn how to use a DJ Deck/Mixer but overall just want to learn music production in general. If by chance anyone has any advice for someone entering the music space for the first time I\u2019m all ears! I\u2019d love to learn about what equipment and software you use. I\u2019m not worried about a budget, as I\u2019m willing to invest as much as needed to have as many options as possible to make the best stuff I can! Regardless in a comment or dm I would like to learn as much as I can in as little time as possible. Thanks in advanced and look forward to the journey that lies ahead!!!"

                "body": "Hello. I was a quiet baby. Then, I became a child, and I became a bit louder. I remember hitting a dog as a young child and just saying \"I  hate Milo\" because the dog's name was Milo .\\_. . I was basically a weird child, alright? I would play with other kids, and sometimes I would have some alone time to myself. Sometimes, I would daydream with the same ideas and plans I had in my head for drawing Five Nights at Freddy's, but if I got the chance to draw or play video games, you bet I would do that! I also was kind of noisy and rude to some kids. Still, overall, I was approachable. I remember fighting over a pink pencil with a boy in my class and wanting the pink pencil myself. With activities, I was usually focused on one thing, but sometimes, I got tired of the work and wished for a break, especially with math (I LOVE MATH!). Alright, I wasn't the most athletic child, but you bet I would run two laps with a lot of energy in me as a second grader would. I honestly was rude to some guys in my class, and then I learned to be nice in first grade lol. XD     Still, whenever the strong emotions of sadness hit me, it resulted in an occasional outburst of anger and bitterness and \"oooh everyone hates me boohoo\". I was excited for some different things that were announced in the future, such as field day or the approaching of summer, and I even planned to watch that Pokemon movie Zoroark: Master of Illusions. I basically had plans for projects in my head that I wanted to get done quickly, but the deadline was a bit uncertain. I said some things that were a bit loud and obnoxious as a child, and I got into fights with my brothers. I would seek enjoyment and pleasure from different activities.There were occasions where I would be a crybaby, alright? Again, at that point, I was still a child.\n\nAlright, yes, I was a nice and approachable child, but at times I would be an energetic and obnoxious child. So, that was my childhood. Every day, I would be working on something, whether it would be a meme, artwork, or just making sure to get my reading in. I am not very surprised about the things that happen in this society, because I wasn't really that emotional about it. Being excited is wonderful, but having strong emotions to me was draining as heck. Don't get me wrong, I can still read people, and I don't like to see anyone sad, but I myself am too tired to feel sad for myself. Whenever I do feel sad, it feels awful, but at the same time, they are just my emotions. To me, my emotions are like soldiers. I select certain ones to let into my castle based on whether or not it is alright in generally to do so. I need to know which ones I should embrace and which ones I should put down. If I'm a bad person for feeling a certain thing, okay, I COULD be a bad person. Emotions are emotions, and I need a compass to tell me which ones are south and which ones are north. .\\_.\n\nDon't get me wrong, eventually, I will feel an emotion for myself, but it usually happens when my brain is being overwhelmed by anxiety or suppressing of other emotions, and internally, I could feel emotionally suffocated, and I would just remain in my calm exterior. I didn't know I could just express that emotion to other people as well smh smh XD. Don't get me wrong, I feel hormones of excitement and accomplishment like anyone else, but it's just a matter of maintaining that feeling to avoid being drained by sadness. When people say something rude, I don't understand what would lead them to that. Okay, maybe it's insecurity or just sadness (I understand if it's sadness/outburst/stress!), but it still feels strange to be offended a random rude saying, unless it's just something generally said to be true that I despise.\n\nAlright, let's get on with this. I can read you. I know what you feel. I would never willingly say something to make you feel miserable like I was in depression. If you have time throughout the day to get something done, it is a time frame that does not have to be very specific at certain times. I think that you will eventually just get it done, whether sequentially, or in different bursts of energy (I prefer to do things sequentially, but you do you). If you don't get it done, I will recognize your feelings, and I will tell you or notify you that you have certain days to do it. My own work approach is the same way. I have certain days to get things done, so I don't really assign myself a certain timeframe. I have different plans for certain things, but it's not specifically laid out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFavorite animal: cats\n\nFavorite colors: 1. Black 2. Red 3. Purple 4.

She was so inspired, she worked for like an hour and a half perfecting her creation, and painting it. She was sooo proud of it when she showed it to me, and she worked really hard on it. I oohed and aahed, looking it over. She did a great job, and then I saw it. A very large, impressively detailed blue horse penis. The shock forced a giggle out of me, but I told her it was lovely and we should put it on a shelf somewhere so it doesn't get damaged. \ud83d\ude05 She's a very clinical individual.  The toys she likes have big ol horse weiners, so that's what she did. She doesn't see what the big deal is, and I would hate it if my immaturity ruined that for her, but you bet I'll be showing her that masterpiece when she's older. Hahaha",

They do fairly well together as long as I watch closely when there is toys or food involved. \nCurrently my mom is visiting our house and has her small dog with her.  Her dog is 3. And they are all neutered males. All of them have been fairly peaceful so far but my Pyr wants to play with my mom's dog and he wants none of it. He'll put his paw on my mom's dog and my mom's dog will snarl and bite his face and then my old dog will get in between them, and the Pyr puppy will run off with the zoomies and come back and do it again. These visits are going to be a regular occurrence, and I would love it if they would all get along. I guess my question is how much should I intervene? I'm hesitant to let them \"work it out\" because the size difference is too much to be safe, and although he's been pretty gentle, he's also been very pushy. He will knock it off if I tell him to. \nHe's crate trained and I can keep them separated if I have to, but I don't want to train him to resent these visits. What signs am I looking for that things are escalating too much? How can I encourage some harmony? Am I crazy for trying to make this work? Help. Lol"

People complaining that Yuumi kept healing early game and don't even bother to build Executioners/Oblivion/Bramble as a first build. Almost everytime they build it last build then end up losing lane early game and lost the game.\n\nBuild it early game against a champion who heals a lot if you wanna take them heads on pls. It's called Oblivion orb (AP anti-heal), Bramble Vest (Tank anti-heal), Executioners caller (AD anti-heal), ans don't fully build it until 3rd build.\n\nEven if you have ignite still build it\nOblivion orb - Morellonomicon (full build), Bramble vest - Thornmail (full build), Executioners caller - Mortal reminder (full build).\n\nGrivious wounds are anti-heal. Bramble vest and Thornmail will affect the enemy attacks you. So unless they attack you, grivious wounds of Bramble vest or Thornmail won't have an effect. While the Oblivion, Morellonomicon, Executioners, and Mortal reminder will affect the enemy if you hit them.\n\nedit corrections: Depends on the champion you use (Master Yi as an example)."

Frequently using topical ointments like Tiger Balm or BioFreeze to assist the discomfort from the injury explained below. Minimal and short-term relief sometimes is achieved. \n\nI experienced what I believe to be a serious rotator cuff injury/tendon injury, with dislocation eleven years ago. I was not insured at the time and did my best to diagnose, treat and rehab on my own. I had a friend assist with the dislocation (what a nightmare). After the initial injury, I had ZERO mobility in the shoulder (could not lift arm at all, bear no weight, extreme pain at pretty much all times) for a long time. \n\nI YouTube-d physical therapy suggestions for rotator cuff injuries and diligently did my tasks every day. Took about two years to have basic mobility and use return. \n\nI am posting today as I still can not lay on my left side without pain, hear a grinding/crunching noise when the arm is rotated and my left arm is now about two inches shorter than my right arm. Laying on my right side, if my left arm crosses my chest is still extremely uncomfortable. Lifting anything heavy with my left arm makes it feel that my shoulder almost...slips down about an inch or two. My job requires extensive use of my arms for spotting gymnasts and dancers in acrobatic tricks and the older I get, the more frequently this injury seems to be affecting my job and overall quality of life and day to day activities. \n\n\nWhat should I do at this point? Is it worth pursuing treatment, and if so, through whom? I saw an orthopedist and they didn't even bother doing an xray, I wasn't taken very seriously and was chastised for not pursuing treatment when the injury initially happened. I truly wish I know what the clinical term for the injury was too. \n\nAny advice would be most appreciated. Thank you all for your time!\n\nEdit: Injury happened while I was spotting a gymnast for a trick. Basically, my body was stationary, gymnast managed to pin my left arm under her leg as she fell away from me. Left arm went with gymnast, body stayed firmly planted. Heard a pop, blacked out from the pain, awoke with arm dislocated and seeing stars."

This is the same Gabriel that struck down king Minos and imprisoned him within a flesh prison. It is possible that Gabriel struck down king Sisyphus aswell and imprisoned his soul in another type of prison, a Panopticon perhaps. Furthermore, the reason Minos was imprisoned was because there was a high chance of his soul turning into a prime soul, which is significantly more likely to happen with Sisyphus due to the fact that his willpower was remarkably higher than that of his predecessor (Evident by his non-peaceful revolution)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to create counterarguments against these or to add on to my points, I'm curious to see what you guys think"

Sorry, it involves math...\n\nIf you keep below your Anaerobic Threshold (AT) for your heart rate, you can usually avoid PEM! It's been life-changing for me. Whenever I pass my heart rate threshold, I take a break and breathe. After I calm and rest myself to get my heart rate back down, I can get going again. So unless I really overdo it, I'm pretty good at not running myself into PEM.\n \n\n\"Since most people with ME/CFS have an AT that is usually 50-60% of healthy people, use this formula to estimate your own AT:\n\n(220 \u2013 age) * 0.6 = estimated AT\n(If you are more severely ill, use 50% or 0.5 instead of 0.6)\n\nAlternatively, you can try:\n\n(220 \u2013 (age * .88)) * 0.6 = estimated AT\n(Or if severely ill, use 0.5 instead of 0.6)\"\n\n\n\nThe science is here for those who are interested. https://solvecfs.org/using-a-heart-rate-monitor-to-prevent-post-exertional-malaise-in-me-cfs/\n\nAlso this is a great organization for ME/CFS research!"

My question is, what is a decent cheap second module that I can install to use AT&T with minimal hassle?  Doesn't need to be the fastest or have expanded carrier aggregation, but I would like it to be relatively cheap and have basic CA so I can use bands 2 and 14 together(though honestly I can also get by with no CA if necessary).  Also would love for it to just be something I slap into the modem and it just works without needing to change firmwares.\n\nMy plan is to primarily use the T-Mobile plan I'm using now with the EM7690 module, and when T-Mobile goes down or I start to run out of data, switch to module #2 and use the AT&T 100GB prepaid sim."

Then I thought about putting the booster at the top of the hill too and running a CAT6 cable, but that's over the length limit of 328ft.  Maybe I could have a series of boosters and that would work well enough?\n\nLooking for any suggestions, even ones that cost at lot.  Thanks\n\nedit: sorry I should have mentioned, there is no power on the hill so I'd need to run an long extension cord to see if the solution works well enough and the come up with something more permanent.

But if that's not in the works, then the current theme needs to be a proper dark theme, meaning no light backgrounds at all.  The midi and waveform editors are the worst offenders here.\n\nI'm a programmer who manages to spend a full work week in front of a computer without getting any eye strain.  And then when I start messing around in Bitwig on the weekend, I get it.  I can write code on the weekends just fine, but Bitwig is what gets me.  Now personally I'm prone to eye strain from dark themes.  I think that's because switching between light themed websites and a dark themed IDE and terminal is hard on the eyes.  If I'm right then Bitwig's dark theme is causing more eyestrain than it should because of the white background in the midi editor.   I don't understand why the whole thing isn't dark themed already?  Seems like an odd choice.\n\nAs far as light themes go, the way I've managed to completely stop eye strain at work is to use proper light themes wherever possible.  It's just easier to make everything a light theme than it is to do the opposite.  I fought against using light themes for years and tried everything else, special glasses, different ambient light and monitor backlight levels, different contrast dark themes, etc..  I liked the aesthetic, and light themes made me feel blind like I was starting at a light bulb.  Turned out switching to light themes was the ticket, and after a week or so, I decided I just couldn't go back.  So I'd really love to see some kind of proper light theme for Bitwig.\n\nAt the very least, the current theme needs better consistency.  I can't imagine that anyone was actually asking for light backgrounds in the midi and waveform editors."

I've sacrificed all my personal time and interests for the benefit of time management and I still find myself scrambling last minute to get things done. Every might I dream I'm taking tests and don't sleep well because of it. \n\nPlus there's my anxiety. I'm coming to the conclusion that nothing helps it. I've been anxious since I was a child, but I've experienced trauma throughout my late teenage years that has made it so much worse.  I tried antidepressants but they made me physically and emotionally numb, and I ended up taking myself off of them in hopes I'd get the nerve to harm myself two years ago so I think they probably did more harm than good. The anxiety causes distressing physical symptoms, most notably what I believe is IBS. I start every school morning feeling as though I'm going to lose my breakfast, one way or another, and I go into class in pain and tense because of it. \n\nI don't feel good or smart enough to be here. I miss my home. I miss my siblings. I don't want to go back to online work, though. If I don't grow up now, when will I? I can't give up. I don't want to give up. I got put on the Dean's List for last semester but now I'm panicking about my grades dropping and me not making it next time. My standards for myself are so high and I never meet them. \n\nThe only things that help me feel somewhat human at this point are CBD and a hot shower, neither of which I obviously have access to in the middle of a school day. I'm lost. Self care is impossible. I want to read books I want to read and color, like I used to, but every free second I spend feels like a diversion from what's actually important and makes me feel like a slacker.\n\nI feel guilty, sad, and stupid. I want my mama, as pathetic as that sounds. \n\nHow am I supposed to get a handle on this?\n\nTL;DR: My mental health is trying to eat me alive. My stomach always hurts, I'm always anxious and crying, and I want to go home but I don't."

She's always just kinda around here, sleeping, playing video games, or hanging out with friends. I don't judge; I'm here for my own education, nothing else. That being said, when I returned home for the weekend, I got an email saying that my room had been marked as a single and that my roommate has likely changed rooms or stopped attending. Concerned, I contacted my RA, who, despite not knowing if he was allowed to tell me, saw my concern and informed me that my roommate is currently suspended and that's why she's not going to classes. With that in mind, I figured I would return after the weekend to find her moved out... Only to come back this morning to find her still in her bed. Can she technically stay here? Is she just biding her time? Is there an appeal process or something? I wouldn't be worried if the email didn't say I could be assigned a new roommate at any time."

Since I'm going to college soon, I'd like to start wearing them again, but I can't. Every time I try to put them, I get so overwhelmed with all the noise that all I want is to hide and cry. It's not that hard when I'm alone, but when I'm wearing them and there are people around me, I just can't stand it. How are you guys dealing with it? It won't be like that forever and I'll get used to it, but how can I survive this stage?"

When I am emotionally  connecting  with someone, higher emotional intelligence in the other  person really  helps things along, but I wouldn\u2019t say that intelligence  is an  overwhelming factor next to character, mannerisms, humor,  generosity,  quirky smile, attentiveness\u2026.\n\nso i wanna know more about you guys?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/mlioex)"

Soon after that she started being like \"okay, let's fix you now\" and was constantly trying to find ways to fix or cure my \"issues\". The only thing that was really that huge of a problem back then was my ED, but her agenda was obviously about changing everything about me, and I could tell it had nothing to do with my actual illnesses or issues but more about controlling me and shaping me into the person she wanted me to be. Later on I began to realize that she was manipulative and abusive, to say the least, and I got panic attacks every time I got a message, so I broke up with her.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  I am just wondering if something similar to this has happened to anyone here and could relate? It was really weird entering a relationship and the person wanting to completely change you as a person while masquerading as if they are trying to help you, but really are trying to be in control over you.  \n\n \n\n Thanks for reading, I hope you are having an amazing day :)"

Where Baldur's Gate has been banished to the Nine Hells. . . . \n\n&#x200B;\n\nImagine a world where good has lost and evil prevailed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Sword Coast has been divvied up by the Zhentarim, the mountain giants of Grudd Haug, the Cult of the Dragon, and many other sinister factions. But above them all looms the Archlich Vecna, who has orchestrated or exploited a series of ever-escalating calamities to conquer the very Realms themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill your players rise to the challenge?

I think the problem is just that I\u2019m not really invested in the characters \u2014 which is kind of ironic since the point of the story is that the villain is the writer for not having fleshed out the characters enough. And I just find the story line is repetitive by nature, and focuses on things that may be interesting meta just for meta\u2019s sake but ultimately feels kinda empty. \n\nI can see what they wanted to achieve but I dont think it\u2019s hitting. For me anyway. Please tell me if I should finish!\n\nEdit: thank you! I decided to watch the last 5 minutes of the last two episodes and I\u2019m satisfied with that haha.

Ned build a sept for Cat to pray in, because that is the godly way. Her house words are Family. Duty. Honour. She even passes on her wisdom to Robb, to try to ensure his survival. She always persuades Robb to do what the gods would support. Do not go back on your oaths, liking breaking a betrothal (and don\u2019t parade your happiness about your hot wife when your bannerman have to marry for alliances.) and don\u2019t behead the ones loyal to you (Lord Karstark) for murdering your enemy (kid Lannister). Unfortunately, Robb wasn\u2019t ready for the job as King and refused good council when he heard it. But it shows that Cat is very wise when it comes to pleasing the gods. Everything that Robb ignored her advice on ultimately led to their deaths. Odds are if Cat was making the decisions things would have gone better. \n\nWhat this also tells me is that when Cat swears an oath she\u2019s going to follow through on it. Her sense of duty is almost incomparable \u2014 see Sansa \u2014 to anyone in the show. Which what makes her scene with Talisa *so damn interesting*, not only does she confess about breaking an oath, but it\u2019s about promising to love **Jon Snow**, of all people. It\u2019s a promise on something so significant for someone she apparently despises. In fact, the only thing that really unseats her, up until Jon Snow, are things that disrupt her family, duty, and honour (Brandon dying, Ned not having a bastard but bringing *home* a bastard, her devotion to her father, to the Blackfish as well.) \n\nA bastard in the north shouldn\u2019t affect her that much. Cersei didn\u2019t give a second thought to any of Roberts bastards and he was King. The only difference is that Cersei wasn\u2019t slighted by Robert, he left his bastards outside of court. Ned might have misstepped because he just wanted to protect jon but court and social status weren\u2019t important that important in the North either. Their values lied elsewhere. They are \u2018blood of the first men\u2019 and pray to the Old Gods, so it\u2019s possible that bastards aren\u2019t as big of a deal as they are in the South. The south have different values and Gods, the Seven.\n\nThe Seven, where everyone has a name and that name matters, is the gods that Cat prays to, hence the tension between the two regarding Jon Snow. They are infringing on each other\u2019s values. Ned had no idea that taking in a bastard to court would mean that Robb is now a target, and that her sons wouldn\u2019t be king if Robb died. But, although Cat had her reasons for wanting to hate and distance herself from Jon, it is wrong to punish an innocent baby for something he can\u2019t control. Being born was no choice of his. Being brought to Winterfell wasn\u2019t a choice of his. \n\nAlthough she realizes this one day, before then, Cat let her unadulterated hate for a little baby get to the point where she wished for baby Jon to die. So, when he actually started dying, she knew she needed to change, for good. She would have sentenced a baby boy to death for hurting her pride (among other things) and she hated herself for it.  \n\nHer anger is understandable, but her actions are not justified. She could be forgiven. She was quite young at the time, immature, and Ned\u2019s choice violated all three of house Tully\u2019s values, and, not to mention, jeopardized the safety of her children. However she directs her anger toward the wrong person. She should be wishing ill on Ned, if anyone, not an innocent baby. She finally was able to let go of her hatred for Jon and resentment of Ned when she saw him dying. She was beside herself with grief. When she, then, prayed to the gods to let the baby live, knowing that if he died it would be her fault... It would have been too much for her conscience. She must have grown to love Ned very much and wouldn\u2019t have wished for him to be in pain or to be the cause of his pain. \n\nShe promised to love Jon \u2014 if he lived. And then miraculously he lived.\n\nSo did she love Jon? There are no moments of tenderness between Cat and Jon in the books, not once... why? Why is the hate that strong between them? How is the hate so fresh, just like it was when Ned brought him home? She cried for him to live, once, as she promised to love him. I don\u2019t believe she intended to lie to the gods, on her honour and he was just a baby, she could love him, build a relationship with him, and treat him like she would a nephew. \n\nAlso, if she made good on her promise to love Jon and then something happened to break her love for him, why was that not included in their POVs? I believe it\u2019s because it\u2019s apart of a key twist that we aren\u2019t meant to know yet.\n\nWhat I\u2019m led to believe is that Cat made good on her promise to love Jon for many years, until she realized how **dangerous** he was. She grew to resent him and was punished for going back on her word, which brings us two questions:\n\n*When* did she stop loving Jon and *why*? \n\n**WHEN**\n\n*\u201cAll this horror that has come to my family, all because I couldn\u2019t love a motherless child.\u201d*\n\n\u2014The first awful thing to happen to the Starks, that we\u2019ve read in real time, and since Roberts Rebellion, was the death of Jon Arryn. \n\n\u2014Jon Arryn was her brother in marriage, married to her sister, and therefore apart of her family, when he died. \n\n\u2014Therefore the moment that Jon Arryn died (\u2018horror to family\u2019) is the moment that Cat stops loving Jon (\u2018couldn\u2019t love motherless child\u2019)\n\n\u2014She\u2019s blaming herself for the tragedy that bestowed her family because she broke a promise to the gods. \n\n\u2014Arryn\u2019s death is also the first significant thing we hear from Cat, as she approaches her husband in the godswood, a place of holiness where she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable.   \n\n**WHY** \n\n*Why did Jon Arryn die & Why did Cat revoke her promise to Jon?* \n\n\u2014Jon Arryn found out about Cersei\u2019s and Jamies incest, maybe he saw them or confronted him, so Cersei made sure he died, she asked Littlefinger to carry it out and then he got Arryn\u2019s wife, Cat\u2019s sister, to poison him. \n\n\u2014Why did Cat revoke her promise? She could have caught Jon trying to get intimate with someone (maybe his \u2018sister\u2019 just like Jamie and Cercei), then she told maester Luwin to convince Ned to send him to the wall. Jon the \u2018half brother\u2019 technically died that day as well as he was forced to leave his family and join a new brotherhood.\n\n\u2014 both situations are very reflective of one another, I believe it\u2019s for a purpose, there have been many examples of Cersei and Jamie being the foils of Sansa and Jon.\n\n**More similarities:**\n\n\u2014Everyone who had a hand in Arryn\u2019s death is dead. \n\n\u2014Cersei, Jamie, Littlefinger, and Lysa. In fact I think everyone on the counsel at the time is dead. \n\n\u2014Everyone involved in Jon\u2019s exile is dead. Cat, Ned, maester Luwin and possibly Robb (we don\u2019t know for sure, but he might have been informed on the plan). \n\nI have a lot more analysis on what \u2014 and why \u2014 could have happened with Jon and Sansa to make Cat hate Jon, but I\u2019ll leave it there for now just to get a feel for what kind of audience I\u2019m talking to haha. \n\nThere might be errors, just wanted to get it out. (Be nice pls.)"

It would have been leagues better if he stayed dead, I liked him in the flashback but he is just so bland and ruins Ace's death. \n\nAs a longtime, since day one Zoro enjoyer I would have much preferred it if Luffy won the tournament and they gave the fruit to Sanji dude, he already has the fire thing going and it would have been wonderful to have a logia on the crew, and this is coming from a guy who loves Zoro and wants him to always be #2 on the crew. It would have also had some amazing moments in the next arcs for Sanji.\n\nAnyway, I am just salty because Oda is so good at storytelling that having a character and a plot point this trash (hurr durr amnesia) just gets me heated. If Oda really wanted Sabo to comeback then it is fine for him to just be a revolutionary with his OWN DAMN STORY but every time he is on screen he just feels like an Ace replacement especially since every two seconds he mentions Ace and how he will carry on his legacy, like shut up you ruined Ace's legacy."
