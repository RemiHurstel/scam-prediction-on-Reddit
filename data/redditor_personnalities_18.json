I can only attribute it to his uncanny intuition, which infallibly diagnoses the ills from which his audience is suffering.... But his very principle is negative. He only knows what he wants to destroy. He pulls down the walls without any idea of what he will build in their place.\u201d\n\n-Otto Strasser, *Hitler and I* (1940)",

Actions tell more about people than words do. Same for the shared dismissive attitude displayed by monsters and their crazy defenders. Out of character? This is about her terrible actions in the game. Character doesn't have much to do with it.\n\n5: Again, saying that Papyrus has never met a human before doesn't excuse much.\n\n6: If Sans knows and cares about things but doesn't do anything about them, why bother defending his lack of responsible action?\n\n7: And you would support and root for someone who says and does terrible things with a no moral excuse? That's interesting.\n\n8: When it's key part of the plot and story, it's hard to be excited when it ties into the bastard human cliche that happens very often in literature. Just look at all those cliche isekai novels where people complain about anti-beastman racism for the sake of being loud and witty. It's been done before and it keeps happening for the same dumb reasons becuase anyone can just say that racism is bad. It doesn't say much about the human condition. There's more than one ideal way to write fantasy, and I lean towards fantasies where people actually respect one each other as equals. Like in classic RPGs like Epic Battle Fantasy 4 and Crystal Story II and Underhero and Sonny. Stories where mutual respect is a thing that exists. Undertale doesn't have that, neither does Deltarune because Toby Fox's petty, snarky anti-JRPG gamer mindset was dismal back then and it really sucks now.\n\n9: It's less about vague interpretations and more about concreate actions that can't be denied unless you want to out yourself as an uneducated arsehole. The world does not need more uneducated arseholes, and I can't respect Toby Fox for inspiring them with his narratives.",

Plus, not excited about the friendship day/night evolution thing.\n\nSylveon and the fairy type aren't in Pokemmo (yet), so that would leave Leafeon and Glaceon for party variety.\n\nThough, I've already read plenty of stuff on how Leafeon and Glaceon aren't good Eeveelutions because of mono grass and ice typing and so-so stats.\n\nPlus, I know that Gastrodon can use the Ice Beam TM for when I eventually get to Cynthia, and plenty of mons can learn Grass Knot, like Infernape. Making Leafeon and Glaceon more than a little redundant at this point.\n\nIs there any benefit to choosing an evolution that could potentially help in the other Pokemmo regions and their gym challenges?"

Roserade usually isn't a stand out Pok\u00e9mon but the grass moves can come in handy on occasion. Garchomps are Garchomps, yes. Uber status, Fast and powerful but dragon-type never really felt that exciting to play around with outside of Dialga and Giratina.\n\nBut still, plenty of fun and fond memories of exploration and training the guys from low level wild beginners into an amazing crew.\n\n...\n\nI was thinking of going back and doing some more casual runs using Turtwig and Chimchar, and I was wondering if there are any robust Pok\u00e9mon Sinnoh lines that you guys consider to be fun to use.\n\nGoing by Sinnoh Pokedex, I never was really interested in dedicated psychic/poison/rock/ground/steel/ghost/dark/ground/ice types and especially bug types, mostly because of type matchups where you want strong ground/dark/ice moves for trained Pok\u00e9mon without stab advantage because the moves are great against certain gym challenges even while you don't want the dedicated typing for your Pok\u00e9mon's defenses.\n\nMachop: It would be fun to incorporate a dedicated fighting type Pok\u00e9mon into my next team.\n\nBuizel/Shellos: Using these two is definitely on my bucket list. Heard great things about them as the former has speed while the latter has a tiny bit of bulk.\n\nRotom: Never really used this ghost-mon. Stats weren't very impressive, and I already had a trained Shinx/Luxio whenever I got Rotom in the chateau.\n\nDrifloon: Has anyone gotten a lot of mileage out of having a Drifblim on their team? Something worth swapping out a Staraptor or a Luxray for?\n\nPonyta: I've used Ponyta once or twice with decent mileage. Fire type and all that.\n\nRiolu: The fandom's fan favorite for many reasons, but I never really trained the baby Riolu you get from the trainer companion with the blue hat. I usually have a dedicated team by that point.\n\nSnover/Sneasel: Might be interesting to use these two, though they aren't available until the snow city late game.\n\nDo you guys have any favorite Pok\u00e9mon to catch and train on Sinnoh casual playthroughs?"

Two Headbucks feel much easier to pull off in a row compared to two Stomps.\n\nIs there anything else to it other than more practice?"

I'm relatively new to studying Stoicism beyond pop culture and I've been pondering on a question. \n\nTo my understanding, a part of Stoicism is a detachment from what you cannot control. This makes sense. It's only rational to exercise control over things within your locus of personal responsibility. However, with regard to people for example, I find this difficult to wrangle with. We react to our judgments about things, not the object of what we're reacting to itself. I don't have any control over a person's internal filters through which they interpret my statements or actions. While I have a personal responsibility to not be intentionally malicious, how a person reacts to my actions or statements is out of my control, or so I think... I'd like any insights on this. Do people's reactions to our actions and statements fall under the scope of things we have control over and should therefore not detach from?"

Now, circumstances have made us continue our relationship over a distance and honestly, I'm sort of at my wits end. It feels like I'm the one even remotely enthusiastic about the relationship. I bring up the topics, I infuse the excitement... I do everything. She can't be bothered to talk to me about anything besides the basics e.g. \"Did you have breakfast?\" \n\nI've been in previous relationships and I know what being in love feels like, this isn't it. I don't sense that at all from her. I constantly feel like I'm overbearing or asking for too much. Communication is an issue. I try to get her to open up about things but it's an issue sometimes. The overall vibe of the relationship feels complacent and God help me am I trying. Typically relationships go through high highs early on and plateau as time goes on. It's not even been more than a month and I feel the plateau hard. I feel unwanted and like I'm forcing the relationship. Some friends have advised me to cut my losses early but I'm trying to hold on, maybe things can get better with time and when we can meet up physically again... \n\nIn summary, it's a one-way vibe street in our relationship. The other end of the street feels cold and dark and I'm thinking of cutting my losses early so I can begin the healing process."

I'm no more shady than any average person who's been raised partially on the Internet throughout their adolescence.\n\nI ended up getting a likely theory. You were right that it was inadvertent key presses. I went to screenshot something as usual, and then I realized what the shortcut was - I do it so blindly, it didn't register to me that it's so close to the screen recording shortcut. So, just slippery fingers on my behalf.\n\nThanks again. I'll keep the applescript suggestion with me in any case. Think I'm gonna start doing that from now on.",

That\u2019s what sucks is that we actually do that and it hurts you but we think it\u2019s what we have to do. \n\nI don\u2019t know how she feels about the friendship, she could either have thrown it away, or she feels too bad about what happened that she\u2019s shunning you out because of the guilt and shame. I\u2019m not really sure. \n\nThe choice is in your hands, you could either let it go or you could wait and reflect more. And if you decide to reach out again you could approach her with something like \u201cHey, I\u2019m not mad about what happened and I don\u2019t want to be angry and I just want to hear how you feel and if you felt too pressured by the responsibility, that you now understand her better.\u201d \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be exactly like that but just something reassuring that your approach is going to be more on the understanding side than on the blame side. Maybe that would help her come back instead of drown in pain. \n\nI am sorry that you are going through this, I might be wrong and my explanations could be wrong.

And if things do get fixed it\u2019s not a promise things like that won\u2019t ever happen again. She still needs to work on herself. \n\nAlso I send you all the best wishes and I hope you recover well. And you don\u2019t need to respond to my message I just hope in some way it helps.

I am not here to defend her actions, I\u2019m here to explain it from her side because I truly relate to her. And I know I need to work on myself and my actions with others. But I think in her situation when she said yes and then said no it was because the yes was coming from having no good boundaries and her feelings taking the better of her and knowing you had her to count on, she couldn\u2019t help but say yes. But then without talking to you the whole time after saying yes she\u2019s been mulling it over in her head, and it manifested into something big and worrisome, that she\u2019s not adequate to take care of you, that she\u2019s afraid of the responsibility and if something happens to you and if she really would be inadequate when things went bad and she panicked. It became a huge responsibility and in the end she said no. After that, telling her it was wrong and cruel it would definitely hit the avoidance wound, of actually being not good enough and if I was in her place I would genuinely think I did the right thing and I did it for your own good and that fine I\u2019ll be the bad guy if that\u2019s how you see it. Then yes I\u2019m a shitty friend who doesn\u2019t do as much as she gets and not even worth your time and friendship and would just huddle up in a corner licking my own wounds and feeling sad about it.\n\nThat\u2019s again my point of view coming from relating to this person that much. It\u2019s not to defend her actions or to play the victim. That\u2019s how it goes inside our heads. We think we\u2019re being good. And then everyone write texts about us avoidants and how cruel we are but they don\u2019t see it from our point of view. That our actions despite how cruel they seem, were coming from genuinely caring too much and trying to do the right thing and feeling trapped unable to explain things because we think our thoughts are too stupid and scary and we don\u2019t know how to express our needs or just say no from the beginning.",

                "body": "Over a year ago I was betrayed by my closest friend. It was a person whom I\u2019ve shared so much with, they knew me to the core. They also were there watching me go through the whole process of maturing and growing. I used be so insecure and defensive and I had these things that I started to notice and work on. \n\nSo this is why it was a real betrayal because they were the ones who knew me. I laid my soul bare and they saw it all. \n\nLooking back, our friendship was good we were mindful of each other\u2019s feelings we talked about so many things in great depth, it became slightly obsessive and we talked too much on a daily basis. Our friend was the strongest during covid when I had so much free time from work. \n\nAnd then this one day, there was a misunderstanding. They were basically blaming me for our lack of communication for a few days and saying they were tired of making so much effort and for me when I read that I remember getting annoyed because they didn\u2019t make much effort. They just sent me photos of their cat or sunsets. There was no hello or any actual initiation. And it was during a tough time at work so I was basically busy. So knowing that they knew me I said their words were annoying. I remember trusting that this wouldn\u2019t hurt them because if it did sound off they would tell me because that\u2019s the bond we shared. \n\nInstead they blocked me. It was like a big slap on the face. I reached out on another social media and told them that was a low blow it shouldn\u2019t have been handled this way and that I will respect their choice and give them the space they want. They responded with me being a pathetic person and that they felt sorry for me. \n\nI knew that if I responded with something confrontational our friendship will break so I had to calm things down and fix things. It ended with me apologizing and having to downgrade myself and them agreeing that yeah I was the problem and next time I should be more communicative. And then it was like nothing has happened.\n\nThe problem is that something did happen. And this person that I trusted clearly didn\u2019t see me as who I was. But these feeling I didn\u2019t process them. I mean we fixed things. There is no need to dwell on it. So we continue to speak. But there is this resentment that\u2019s beginning to grow inside me. I remember on new year\u2019s I thought I gave this person my whole time during covid when I had the most free time in my life. Instead of chasing my goals. So I started to pull away. I thought if I am resentful then they are right. I am that pathetic person. I am hateful. So problematic they are right. So I resented them more. So that added to the self hate and the crazy making. \n\nI couldn\u2019t understand my emotions. And that\u2019s when they started sending me long texts of how tired they are of me. That I destroyed something that was so pure and so good. It was all me. \n\nSo again that added to the resentment and the self loathing. The confrontations never stopped. They demanded instant answers when I was confused and I had no idea what was happening to me. \n\nI shut down. I stopped reading. I stopped with the exploration of topic I was so enthusiastic to learn about. I grew distant with everyone else. I just poured my energy on work which was getting so busy. I became the depressed shell of a person I used to be.\n\nAnd then one day I reflected and realized them saying those things to me about being pathetic and blocking me; didn\u2019t come from me. It was their insecurities and past experiences with other people. So I shouldn\u2019t be hurt by that. I told them that. I told them I needed time to focus on myself and reflect gosh I\u2019ve said it too many times that I can\u2019t process things without having space. But their definition of space was just a few days so they would hammer me with the confrontations and guilting again and again. \n\nI remember feeling so bad and guilty I told them that I was a vengeful hateful person and that I was trying to give them a taste of the pain they caused me. This wasn\u2019t true. It was just me taking the blame and feeling so guilty and horrible and blaming myself for everything. \n\nSo they reach out and say they want to fix things. That they are happy I was finally able to admit that I am those things. That things finally made sense that I finally explained things to them and they were able to understand. And that throughout those confusing times when I was going crazy, I was lying to them and manipulating them. And as a gift they sent screenshot of me saying I am a hateful vengeful person, circling it and sent it to me. \n\nThis was when I finally had the self respect to end it for good. To block them and tell them not to speak to me. They tried reaching out and I told them about how those screenshots were the final straw and I can\u2019t accept them in my life. So they twist it and say that I am a negative person who can\u2019t see the bigger picture and if I one day had an open mind, only then I should reach out to them. Which was crazy since they were the ones who reached out I was telling them not to! \n\nThis happened throughout the course of 1 and a half years. I spent months afterwords trying to piece back myself. It is an amazing feeling when I finally got my old productive routine back. To be able to do the things I loved and have the energy for them. They sucked up my energy. I remember I was talking to this person and I was explaining myself and apologizing for having to go and spend some time helping my mom in the kitchen. And they were like hey you don\u2019t need to apologize or explain that! I remember being surprised by that response. And that moment I realized this is how things should be. \n\nMoral of the story is:\nWhen someone betrays you, you could never ever trust them again.  Because that person you did trust, didn\u2019t even exist to begin with. And no matter how hard you try to hold on, it will only bring you down further. Cut them off. Live your life. You deserve better than that. And always trust your gut. Don\u2019t let them mess with your head."

Dubchaeng = Twice\u2018s Dahyun and Chaeyoung. Both are their respective group\u2018s rap line)\n\nYerene and Dubchaeng\u2018s rap has been criticised by many for being unnecessary and not adding much to the song, and I honestly can\u2019t get behind it at all.\n\nYes, they\u2019re obviously not on par with top tier female rappers like Moonbyul or Soyeon - but they\u2019re not *meant* to be either. Twice and Red Velvet are not focused on rap, and never have been. \n\nTwice is more performance based, meanwhile Red Velvet is known for their duality and amazing vocals and harmonisation. However, Dubchaeng and Yerene do their job quite well for what it\u2019s supposed to be - fun rap / talk singing lines to be catchy and switch up the pace of the song. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine songs like Likey, What is Love, Red Flavor and Happiness without their iconic rap parts. \n\nSure, I\u2018d love Yeri and Irene to get more vocal parts too because their vocals are very underappreciated and they can hold their own, but I definitely don\u2019t want them to ditch the rap. It\u2019s too catchy.\n\nDubchaeng are also better off as rappers because both of them are amongst the weaker vocalists in Twice.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m getting downvoted by mad hoes lmaooo sorry for having absolutely correct opinions ig B)"

She\u2019s the full package - great vocals, FANTASTIC stage presence and godly dancing. \n\nNayeon is very charismatic and her vocals are nothing to joke about either. She\u2019s one of the most popular members of Twice too, so that alone already guarantees solo success. It girl vibes.\n\nJeongyeon my beloved\u2026 the hidden gem of Twice. It\u2019s a shame she isn\u2019t given more lines, because she\u2019s a strong vocal and one of the more confident members too.

If I don\u2019t do bodyweight exercises, I do cardio in form of dancing (30-45 minutes) and lots of walking again (10+k steps).\n\nOn my lesser active days where I don\u2019t workout I still walk a lot (the same amount, 10+k steps) and the amount of my calories burned is estimated to be around 1.9k. \n\nI can believe the 1.9k because it\u2019s what TDEE calculators give me when I put in lightly active, but 2.1k-2.3k?

                "body": "Alright so first of all I think a lot of us here are huge HIMYM fans,  it\u2019s the equivalent for me of how much Ted loves Star Wars (just like what Marshall said \u2014 I also watch it when I\u2019m homesick with the flu, I watch it on rainy Sunday afternoons, I watch it on Christmas eve. I watch HIMYM in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad.) This doesn\u2019t mean that I consider HIMYM the funniest sitcom out there (still one of the best though), I understand its shortcomings after all. Now back to HIMYF, here are some of the reasons why I think the first episode is a disaster. \n\nFirst, I think the pilot episode is all messed up. Now I understand they\u2019re trying their best to make it seem unique and \u201ctrendy\u201d but you can clearly see how they\u2019re unsure how to connect this show with HIMYM (and the OG fanbase) and how they can attract new viewers. In HIMYM\u2019s pilot episode, we got a proper introduction of Ted and what the show was really all about (and no it\u2019s not simply about \u201ctelling the story\u201d but telling his kids about his love story). Ted is not just there narrating his sexcapades and how much he had fun during his younger years, he was there teaching his kids life lessons. This is one of the main reasons I love this show. It\u2019s not your typical slapstick sitcom where everything has to be funny just cuz (I\u2019m looking at you Seinfeld). We also got this combination of characters revolving around Ted (cuz the show is all about him), Marshall \u2014 his best-friend, Lily \u2014 their college friend and his best-friend\u2019s girlfriend/fiancee, Barney \u2014 the sort of antihero character opposing Ted\u2019s qualities, and Robin, the main character\u2019s love interest. It\u2019s just perfect. And these were all introduced on episode 1 (so don\u2019t tell me the first few episodes don\u2019t count much). Now with HIMYF, I honestly don\u2019t know where to start. The phone call so future Sophie can tell her son about her love story seemed forced and made the whole thing felt kinda \u201ccheap\u201d. Sophie meeting the other cast thru an Uber is just poor writing imo. Oh and speaking of writing, jesus how did we go from \u201cIt was like something from an old movie, where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor, turns to his buddy and says, see that girl? I'm gonna marry her someday.\" to cringey millennial quips and horrible subway jokes. \n\nI\u2019m still giving this show a shot but comparing two pilot episodes really put things into perspective."

I (22M) have been in a relationship for almost 2 years now with this girl (22F).\n\nWe've had our ups and downs, like any other relationship, I have even considered, and talked to her about breaking up more than once in this time because I just wasn't sure about the relationship lasting, like I felt it had an expiration date, and I didn't want to hurt her more when that inevitably happened in a future. \n\nWe talked things out and I finally decided to stay with her (she was insisting, and tbh, we didn't have any real problems). But the thing is, I feel like I will never be completely sure of the relationship. I think I will always have that thought in the back of my mind, popping every now and then, reminding me that it will end someday, and because of me. \n\nI just don't know if I love this girl, or any possible girl in a hipothetical world, enough to be with her for an indefinite period of time which could potentially be till any of us die. \nShe, on the other hand, has very clearly and repeatedly stated that she knows she wants to be with me, that I'm the love of her life and she wouldn't want to be with anyone else even if I died. I believe this is bullshit. Like, I think she would definitely eventually move on with her life (like it should be), but she is kinda old-fashioned in that sense too so I don't know. \n\nWe are atm not living together but I do sleep at her place 2 or 3 times a week. But actually living together... On one hand scares me and on the other I sometimes find myself thinking if I would be happier on my own. \n\nI'm tired of not having it enough clear. And time keeps going by. It's only a matter of time that we'll end up living together."

I've seen videos on the method and I've always seen the people in them just going fully on the ice water from room temperature.\n\nHas decreasing the temperature progressively the same benefits as doing it shocking the body?\n\nI'd like to hear your thoughts on this, thank you!"

Having her has been the only thing that has allowed me to stay away from PM successfully. I've been trying to quit for decades. \nI've been so insanely full of urges since yesterday it's insane. I feel like someone injected me with a drug. I initiated sex twice last night alone because I couldn't sleep from the urges. Husband's at work now and I'm full of energy. Been going to the gym daily for the past 3 weeks. It feels incredible to let the energy out.. but I do feel like my libido is also increasing (and it was already high). \nI'm struggling with the strong desire to jump on every man I see. This is so tough... I thought these crazy-brained intense urges were behind me. One old post that I can't find right now talked about seeing urges as a source of energy.. not necessarily to be used sexually but to be motivating for other activites. I like that idea it feels good.. but I have an infant with me 24/7 and there's only so much I can really do. Plus I'm sore from the gym most days so I can't drop to the floor and start doing push ups. lol. \nI needed to vent this somewhere. Grateful for this sub. \nI'm going strong and I'm so happy to say I've found alternatives to dealing with urges and with stress that don't involve PM. I'm grateful so much for that... it makes me want to cry. My whole life I've wanted to be able to deal with life without some self-destructive addiction.. and I never could... this is the longest I've gone and I feel so light and powerful and capable. I feel proud of myself - a feeling I'm very unfamiliar with. I also don't want to model bad habits now that I'm a mom.. and since baby is always with me it feels nasty the thought of doing it while she is in the same house.\nI'll be damned if I'm going to throw that all away on an urge..\nI've got to fight this urge even if it kills me. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks yall."

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**\n\n* I am very interested in real-time 3D graphics. I\u2019m also passionate about FOSS and the Hacker Ethic. I would prefer the GPU to be 1650 or stronger, but if that exceeds my budget then the minimum is 1050Ti. I NEED a good GPU to run my raymarching game engine. RAM needs to be at least 8 GB, I need to be able to juggle a lot of apps for gamedev. Hard drive needs a lot of space, speed is compromisable (my engine will use much more RAM than disk). Screen needs to be 1080p, 60+hz. I don\u2019t really need anything much for sound, I\u2019ll be mostly using headphones anyway. \n\n>**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** \n\n* Well I think roughly around $800. Definitely not averse to buying stuff used, provided condition is still good. \n\n>**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** \n\n* Need this thing ASAP so probably next paycheck, AKA next Friday. \n\n>**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\\)** \n\n* Keyboard, monitor, tower, and all the internal parts. \n\n>**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** \n\n* Colorado, USA. Yeah about the Microcenter, but that\u2019ll blow about $30 off my budget for that 4 hour drive both ways. \n\n>**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** \n\n* Hmm, probably HDD, possibly SSD, definitely RAM, all from my old laptop. I will provide this info on request, but I\u2019ll have to take apart my laptop first. \n\n>**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** \n\n* Not really. I like to keep computing fairly uniform if possible. \n\n>**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**\n\n* Well I\u2019d say compute shader cores, but I kinda want to have an average gaming PC because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to run my game engine. So, no. \n\n>**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**\n\n* Simple. Compact, if possible. Definitely cheap. \n\n>**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**\n\n* NO NO NO lol. I would rather have almost any other operating system BUT Windows, but anyway I kinda already have that part covered. \n\n>**Extra info or particulars:**\n* Not that I can think of rn. I\u2019ll have the provided parts out by tomorrow."

I often focus on people. I love to talk. The only thing I am sure of is that I have a lot of Ne.\n2. Next, I love to be abstract and I am. People say I am really imaginative. I\u2019m pretty curious about people and other things too. I am pretty idealistic. I also took an IQ test yesterday and I got 145.\n3. I am very very sensitive. I often look for expressions that concerned others. But I\u2019m pretty logical too. People say I\u2019m very kind and I love to spend time with them.\n4. Next, I literally HATE schedules and routines\u2014they are just too boring. And yep, I procrastinate too much. I even procrastinated a week for this post lol. And I am very very messy.\n5. I\u2019m often confident that things will work out for me.. and I am always sure of what I want and what I don\u2019t.\n6. If I spent a weekend all by myself, I would hate it. I would feel very lonely and it will rather make me feel kinda depressed.\n(I GUESS IT IS NOT THAT MUCH OF A SHORT POST NOW \ud83d\ude02)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nngtm0)"

Non-hijabis are wearing crop-tops and short tees with wide jeans while hijabis add a long sleeved shirt underneath or over. \n\nWomen in their late 20s/early 30s seem to prefer the tried-and-true dress pants and blouse look professionally, jeans and shirt look casually. Many also wear flowy dresses with cinched waists, especially hijabis. Rarely do you see women in this age range wear jilbab or abaya.\n\nIt feels like once they turn 40, women here stop wearing pants. Instead they shift to jilbabs, abayas, or maxi skirts with blazers, and most of their outfits are more formal than younger women's. \n\nOlder women (60+) don't dress as formally as middle aged ones. They seem to either dress in traditional clothing, or whatever's most comfortable for them be it sporty clothing or casual dresses or whatever. This desire for comfort first makes some grandmas surprisingly stylish.",

                "body": "Dota is a team game, but if you are a teamplayer in a bracket where such gameplay is actually griefed by your teammates, it might be a sign that you play above your bracket.\n\nIf you go position 5 Lich and play like a proper 5 should, i.e by spending your networth on regen for your carry yet he fails at every stage of the game, you will suffer severe braindamage. One example is him last picking pos 1 Sniper into Timber 3, buying no regen and attempts the Topson build. Worse, when his gameplay does not work out, he pings and blames you for picking Lich instead of a \"useful\" support who has a stun like Lion and all chat's \"gg end\" as he afk farms jungle.\n\nWhen you go position 1, your support picks Pudge, sits afk in trees and misses all his hooks. Leaves lane without buying you a single salve -- completely different to how you play support -- and doesn't buy any wards either, because why would he?\n\nYou lose your lane and so does your mid and offlane forcing you to 3-man jungle while the enemy dominates the whole map. Now, if you are a teamplayer you might be inclined to try and fight with your team, use voice chat to call for smoke ganks on solo enemies and create chaos on the map.\n\nFrom experience, however, this doesn't work below 6k. Not even in divine dota. The only way to gain MMr up to 6k is if you pick a hero that can ignore your whole team and can recover / afk farm until it can give 1v9, like Luna/Medusa/Tiny depending on the meta. This allows selfish pos 1s to climb by playing solo in a game that's supposed to be a team game until they reach a certain MMr that's way more coordinated and where such incorrectly learned gameplays are actually punished, but which is the gameplay they have learned and can't seem to discard, so they continue it even in 6k where their 0-2-1 gamestyle is actually a huge detriment to their team.\n\nThese players, however, keep gaining MMr up to this point (6k) -- and that, by the way, also includes greedy supports who pick, for example, Sniper and play to become a second core to increase their chances at winning as opposed to standard supporting. Who don't gain MMr? Those who play the team-game proper because their team-oriented gameplay is actually punished in a game where their teammates don't understand drafts, items, positioning or gameplay in general. And yes, that includes divine. Even in 5k people are completely oblivious.\n\nPoint being, if you find yourself reading up on guides, watching replays, thinking about the game etc yet you just can't seem to win, it might be a sign you are playing above your bracket with teammates who make every game insufferable for you. It doesn't matter if you are an Archon player who has given up on ranked and only queues unranked or someone hard-stuck in divine. Dota is a team game, but only after 6k. Until then, it's a constant grind with insufferable and egoistic teammates with whom you in 90% of games can't make any teamplays with yet yearn for the 10% of the games where you do get decent teammates. So, don't take it out on yourself or feel bad whatever your MMr is, supposed that you do play in a very team-specific way. It is the correct gameplay, but sometimes when your teammates play incorrectly, you just have to do the same to win."

Also, not very deep in the character data / skill progression yet\n\nBut for me, I'm seeing an unconscious bias when I'm Gnosia to off Gina or Shigemichi first. I mean, I like everyone to an extent, but if I gotta take out someone ... \n\nBack to strategy, Raqio is often one of the first fridged anyway, Comet is always down to collab so good to keep around -- And Jonas and Yuriko are over here playin' 4d chess so it's good to remove 'em (and Jonas' text hurts to read sometimes)\n\nEdit: Idk why I wrote Yuki. I thought I wrote Yukio even. Her name is Yuriko rip\n\nEdit 2: I see we're going strong on the strategy angle, which is fair. My usual choices Gina and Shigemichi are very non-threats tho and I'm reconsidering my process XD"

Their job is to find what location the rest of the group is at, which is sent to all the non-Spy's phones. Everyone takes turns asking another player a question, trying to subtly prove their innocence & sus out the Spy. Goal for the non-Spies is to find the spy) \n\n1. I'm not the spy, it's my turn to ask a question. The location is a car service station. I turn to my Mom \"Is there machinery in this location?\". When she says no I'm quickly like \"Welp, she's the spy\". Half the group is split on what counts as machinery, my sister agreeing with me that cars & car fixing stuff obviously counts as machinery. And there's a big metal robot arm in the location picture! I don't remember who was the spy this round, but they had definitely been on the side of \"that doesn't count as machinery\"\n\n2. I'm the spy, lucky me. I did get found out but in the stupidest way / on the stupidest question. \"Can you die here\". Even without context, I'm fairly certain you can die anywhere! Like, you don't become immortal in certain locations. If it's your time to go, boom heart attack etc. etc. And I answer it roughly like that \"Of course, you can die anywhere\". The location was Jail and they quickly outted me"

Then she started physically tapping my leg to get my attention, and I told her if it wasn't anything concrete and important I can't handle it right now, she kept tapping, only to continue screaming the same useless things when I took my headset off. I tried, but I seriously can't keep my cool around her, and I started shouting too. Which I suspect is exactly what she wanted. I told her once more I'm not doing this and now I'm ignoring her with my headset on remembering all the times she drove me to school (which I am grateful for) but she literally screamed at me until I showed up crying at school. I can't do this anymore. I'm not telling her shit anymore she can use against me. I'm not engaging with her when she wants to fight, and I'm distancing myself from her as much as possible when I get the money to move out.

After reading about the \"tension - explosion - honeymoon \" cycle that often happen with narcissists I've payed close attention to this. I've done my very best to stay calm and be detached lately so she would have no reason to snap, but today I woke up and she was stomping around and screaming at me having this crazy look in her eyes. I realized it didn't matter what I answered her as she just wanted to get an excuse to lash out, even if I just opened my mouth to speak that made her stop me and get even angrier since I tried to respond. She was mad I hadn't cleaned up after everyone else in the kitchen, even though none of the mess was mine, it was mostly hers. Then she shouted how I should have \"already known\" I should have painted the house etc. I stopped her calmly after a while when I felt my anxiety bubbling up in me and told her \"I'm setting a boundary now because I can't deal with you when you're in this mood, I will clean the kitchen but I will not talk to you anymore today. You can text me if I need to do something else\". She of course got angry and started threatening to break my privacy by coming into my room etc to yell when I walked away. I came back to clean the kitchen wearing my headset. After a minute she tried to test the boundary I just put up by asking \"nicely\" if I had seen something she knows I never use, just to see if I'd respond. But I kept cleaning and told her she could text me. She then blew up and stomped away cursing me and how childish I was being. A part of me immidiately thought \"oh no am I being childish?\" but I squashed that thought and realized I felt oddly empowered by doing this. It's such a small thing but I think that by practicing sticking to the small boundaries I put up I will eventually teach my brain that it's ok to stick to bigger boundaries and not let up when she pushes them. Normally a day like this would end in a huge fight and me crying, but Im glad I managed to avoid that and have a way to escape what felt like there was no escape from before. Also my father is out of the house today for the first time in a while and I realize how much I never want to be alone with her again because she treats me horribly if he's not there to \"check\" on her. My brother is home and I tried to casually talk to him but things are rocky between us lately and he just escaped her as always by going to work out or something, leaving me with the mess. It sounds weird but the more boundaries I put up against my mother, the stronger her and my brothers relationship seems to be and I seem to be losing him more and more. I think she speaks to him about how shitty I am a lot when all I do is not let her take her frustration out on me anymore, but she can't stand that of course. Just wish he wouldn't let her manipulate him like that."

I'm the asshole who can't just let it go when she makes an annoying comment and I'm the asshole who won't smile and laugh for them. Like on our walk she kept saying how negative I've been these past days and that I'm doing worse mentally, not at all like last week when I was doing so well and being so nice to her. Funfact, I wasn't doing well then and I'm actually doing better now. She literally base my wellbeing on how nice I make her feel. It's just always all about her. I've also read a bit about the \"honeymoonphase - tension - explosion - forgiveness\" scenario with narcissists and I think we've moved on from the \"honeymoonphase\" that happened right after a big fight we had two weeks ago and she thought I forgave her (I didn't..), and now we're moving back into the \"tension\"phase. This just explains so well why I always no matter who I'm with keep waiting for them to explode. I'm always waiting for people to start yelling at me if we spend too much time together because this cycle is all I know. I'm going to try and do my best to not give her any excuse to explode, but I just know she'll be pushing all of my buttons trying to make it happen.

Might be even worse now because of coronatimes and the loneliness it has brought on and how this show filled that gap somewhat. It just made you feel you had an actual group of people around you. Anyone else felt just so many emotions from the finale it's hard to put into words? I'm not sure why the office just hits so much harder when it comes to nostalgia than other shows.. maybe it's because it feels more real or ordinary in a way we can relate to? Like Pams last quote \"beauty is in ordinary things\" does truly make you want to appreciate how life is right in this moment and the people in it, even if they have their flaws or you feel like your situation is a little boring or not as good as it can be. I mean the start of the show honestly made me wonder how anyone would want to spend their life like that, in a job they hate in a boring town, but in the end look at how much they gained just by sticking around. There is so much focus these days on chasing your dream and moving on all the time, but maybe the most meaningful relationships happen by simply giving other people your time and presence? Or maybe the entire show is just a portrayal of stockholm syndrome where you have no other choice than to learn to love a situation and people you hate because there are no other options (kidding..kinda).  When I really think about it I think these strong feelings I got from watching the finale also stems a little from jealousy or maybe a small amount of panic that by spending so much time alone, not being around other people every day like they do in the office, I have \"wasted\" the potential of building such a strong bond with others and now it's \"too late\". I mean in the office these friendships just happened by being there over long periods of time, so what happens when we sit at home alone all day now? Perhaps it feels nice and stressless to be alone, but we also miss out on the opportunity to make meaningful connections with others. What are your thoughts and feelings on the finale? Did it make you sad or want to do something differently in your life?"

                "body": "So after things got really tense at home lately (everyone is home all the time due to covid) I escaped to out family cabin in the woods. My mother was saying to my dad I was too mentally unstable to go alone, but I managed to convince him I really needed some time away and after a while my mother had to relent. I've been alone now for a week and have had a lot of time to reflect. It's a bit lonely and sad, but the freedom of being away from my family is heaven. However, today my mother came to visit. When she suggested it I didn't feel like I could say no since she said she wanted to stay at the cabin too and needed to relax. I felt really anxious about it but told myself it \"would be nice\", her words really, not mine. She arrived seven hours ago. Now I'm writing this crying. We couldn't even have one night together where we talked about something deeper than the weather without a huge fight happening. I know I should have just said nothing and let it go, but I think a part of me is being extra aggressive lately because I kinda need to feel justified for even thinking she's a narc? Like I'm almost forcing her to say bad things as \"evidence\" or whatever that I'm in fact not making this all up. It's just so easy to second guess yourself or even forget how bad they really are after some time apart. These past months I've told myself I'm overreacting and overthinking over and over, but then something like this happens again and I remember how bad it really is. \n\nThe fight was really long and it's too much to get into all of it, but it's all the same things we've argued about for many years and it made me realize nothing is going to change. She even screamed at one point \"this is who I am! This is my personality!\". I said treating someone like shit isn't personality it's behavior. She said she won't change anything about herself and then she said \"you only criticize me what do you expect me to do??\". I said to change your behaviour because I can't handle this anymore. I'm trying to explain how the things you say make me feel bad but you refuse to change them. She then started getting angry again about her always being criticized etc. Is it a common thing with narcs that they can't handle any crticizm? I can say a hundred things but she'll only focus on the one sentence that was about her. \n\nIts just always the same... I was trying again to tell her that we need to talk about out family dynamic and communication to move forward. She only say she wants us to be positive do things together and not talk to move forward. I kinda understand, but I have literal trauma from her growing up so I can't just \"let it go\" and smile when I feel physically ill being around her. I get so angry and frustrated. I even told her this and she just got mad instead of acknowledging my feelings. \"Why is everything my fault? You need to focus on yourself!\",\"grow up!\", \"why are you so negative, you blame everyone else for your problems!\". Saying things like this really hurt because unlike her I actually stop to think if the other person might be right. She makes me second guess myself so much. These past weeks reading about narcisissm has made me feel sure to go to a psychiatrist and then maybe no-contact, but now once again, I feel like she might be right that I'm tearing the family apart and that I am the problem. Maybe I'm actually mentally ill without noticing and I'm overanalyzing things I shouldn't. I feel so guilty because I know I made her sad and she really did want this trip to be nice, but nice for her is ignoring my feelings completely and I just can't do that anymore when its killing me. Sigh.. why is this so hard."

                "body": "Hello! I have always been a lurker on this site and I'm generally not one who shares anything about myself online, but the past week so much has happened and I'm kinda desperate to share my story with someone outside of the family as I'm feeling extremely alone and isolated in my parents house right now, away from all my friends. It's going to be hella long, but please bear with me. Okay so I'm pretty sure my mother is a narcissist to some degree. I recognize her in a lot of whats written here and every time I read up on narcissism it just makes so much sense. My dad is deep down a nice guy I truly believe, but he's an enabler and easily manipulated by my mom into being hostile towards me, making me have two adults \"against\" me at all times. They never listen to me or wait for me to finish a sentence before they're at my throat. I have never really gotten emotional support or validation from them. It's always been this way ever since I was a teenager. After hundreds of fights over the years and me hoping they changed but instead getting my heart broken over and over, I have somewhat made my peace with them not ever changing. It hurts a lot still and I can literally feel myself still getting disappointed after I for example talk about something enthusiastically only to get shut down in the way they always do. It takes something from you I think when you've experienced it so many times. Especially when you don't have that many other people to talk to. Sometimes it feels like I have to talk to them to not lose my sanity to loneliness, but at the same time I just feel more alone afterwards. It's tricky. HOWEVER, having sort of made my peace with this and that everything is not actually all my fault like my mother have liked to say over the years, something different has happened which I'm not sure how to handle: My brother (I'm 26, he's 25) who I've seen as one of my closest friends in many ways throughout the years and who's been my ally towards our parents in the sense that I could at least talk to him about them (and he's agreed on many toxic traits they have) has very suddenly (to me at least) decided he hates me and wants nothing to do with me. I am probably still in shock while he has continued living like nothing these past days. I hear him laughing all the time, while I have barely left my room. I feel like hell. My parents are saying I'm overreacting, but my friend who I talked to said I'm the only one in this family who actually reacts like a normal person with feeling. My parents have always just pretended nothing happened after heavy fights. No sorry or talking about it. Just pretending. I think they expect this to happen now as well, but I have never fought with anyone but my mother this way. I have never seen my brother like this and I know he's serious. Hell after everything that's gone down I don't think I feel comfortable being in his life anymore even if he says he's sorry. I will just feel like a burden after everything he confessed to feeling towards me. I thought he loved me and enjoyed my company. We have the same type of humour and can really understand each other, or at least that's what I've seen all these years, but now I'm questioning everything about my entire life. Is it really that crazy that I'm having an emotion reaction to losing someone who was one of my closest people?? This is serious and heavy stuff and I feel more alienated than every from my family hearing them laugh downstairs while I have barely eaten and feel I have to sneak around the house not to bother anyone or be yelled at because I can't handle that right now. To my mother my brother has been the golden child and I the scapegoat, but I never really resented him for it until now as I hear him and my mother suddenly talk more and seem to be bonding over how \"crazy\" I am and it's also given my mother a \"free-pass\" I guess and she's started up her toxic behaviour towards me again. If my father wasn't here I think she'd be even worse. She makes sure to say the most nasty things to me when she knows he can't hear it. Then she'll bother me again later when he's around so she can tell him I'm not doing well mentally and need help etc because I'm not in a good mood because of the way she's acted towards me when he wasn't around a couple hours before. Things got a bit better when I moved out, but if I visited for longer than two weeks she would start her shit again without fail. There is so much more to say but I first need to start my story at the beginning I feel like, even if noone reads this I feel like I'm going crazy and need to try and make sense of my life right now and maybe it helps to get a bit of an overview and well as I suppose just to get a better impression of me and the entire situation. Perhaps someone recognize something similar that happened with them or even think they might recognize something that possibly is \"wrong\" with me. I'm open to all answers, I'm always doubting myself to the degree I had to stop doing too much \"self improvement\" but I'm open to changing if I'm the problem. However I can tell I'm also feeling angry, bitter, hurt towards my family. I' trying to figure out what to do from here. A part of me just wants to cut all ties and go no contact. Now I don't even have my brother linking me to them. Maybe this is a good thing?  This is going to be a super long read but I think I need to get it all out while I feel like writing. I'm going to go back to the argument with my brother at the end so its okay to just scroll there if you don't want my entire lifestory. \n\nFirst off, I am going to be completely honest. I am so embarrassed and carry a lot of shame about my life and often hide the fact from friends that I'm 26 and have never really had a job. I often feel like I have no right to complain about anything in my life and are scared to be called a brat or spoilt because my parents have often given me money to survive (though I have loans that got me through my studies). However it always felt like their money came with a price. Every time my mother would buy me clothes or something I needed she would start yelling at me the second we got home or in the car. There were so many instances where I got in a car with her alone and she would shout at me even though I begged her to stop until I broke down crying because she knew I had no way to escape. I still get extreme anxiety from being alone with her and have tried to avoid it as much as possible the past years. However this has not been easy, more like nearly impossible, since I had to move back home last summer after four years of living alone when corona hit and I was done with my bachelors degree. I remember dreading having to move back home, whereas a friend I lived with looked forward to it. I remember shoving the feeling aside and telling myself I was overreacting. Now a year of living at home with no luck getting a job, I deeply regret my decision. All the work I did on my self esteem and metal health those four years I lived alone feels like has been for nothing. I now remember how bad things actually were when I was a teenager and to be honest I don't get how I survived it. I'm an adult now and thought I was finally mentally stable but I'm going crazy and I think I'm even having suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. How a kid could handle this I'm not sure. There are so many fights and things my parents have said and done to me over the years I don't even know where to start. The hardest part is maybe that a lot of it might also not sound \"that bad\" , or I think to myself I'm just overreacting, but I now recognize that as not my opinion but my parents voices I have internalized over the years. The toxic behaviour happening in this family is serious, but I'm the only one in the family who seem to see that or react emotionally to it at all it seems. And they hate it and often punish me somehow if I point it out. The relationship I have with my mom has been horrible since I was 11-12 (?) and started having my own opinions. I stopped telling her every single thing that happened and following her direct orders on how to handle it. She didn't like that and thus the screaming matches began until I broke down. She still does this and I am 26 years old. I have tried to set boundaries such as telling her I need space from the argument but she just runs after me screaming in my face until I say something back I regret. I'm sooooo sick of being the only one in the family who feels like shit after every single argument while they move on like nothing. No regrets for them it seems. I've never ever gotten an apology from my mother even when she has clearly crossed the line. Its only \"I'm sorry YOU misinterpreted me\". The thing is like a lot of the people in here I was a \"gifted\" kid. I excelled in school and did assignments years above my grade. And I did i all on my own, my parents never helped me once with my homework, I had to figure it out all alone but yet they bragged to others about it like they did something to help with it. The only thing my mother was interested in was the drama at school between me and the other girls. I was a pretty mature kid (something my parents still like to point out a lot..), and I think I actually had a bit of a breakthrough going from elementary school to middle school. I realized I had become my mother and that wasn't something I wanted. I recognized that I had actually become a bully like my mom wanted and that my friend group didn't really like me, they feared me. I had taken a lot of my mothers advice and maybe it gave me an advantage being so aggressive seeing noone messed with me, but I didn't like myself or know who I even was. I also cut all ties with my best friend I had spent basically every day with for seven years because I recognized she didn't dare speak up to me and I just bossed her around. I saw it was toxic even at such a young age. Or maybe I just wanted to isolate myself, I'm not sure. I even apologized to a lot of these kids because I felt so guilty. And I know this is so long ago it feels a bit silly to still obsess over it, but I feel its important to the whole story because it was around this time my \"idyllic\" childhood ended and I went from \"the golden child\" to \"the scapegoat\". I was cut off from my parents love completely and all I did was wrong.\n\nStarting middle school I was like a ghost. I can't even recall most of it. Was probably depressed. Felt a lot like I wasn't there. I got a new best friend who was loud and honestly a little toxic, and I became the quiet sidekick of hers. I lost all my personality and every single day I got yelled at when I got home. I started skipping school because of insomnia, probably caused by heavy anxiety but I didn't even know that anxiety was a thing until I was like 18, and I was emotionally exhausted from all the fighting at home. When they went to work was the only time I felt I could breathe and move around the house freely. It felt like heaven. Like I was finally free. I can only remember a few things from these three years like my parents having to drive me a lot to school because i missed the bus ( I still struggle a lot with time management and anxiety if I'm going somewhere) and they screamed at me the entire way there. Now maybe I deserved that part. However, they never, ever, asked me how I was feeling or why I didn't make it to the bus. They just screamed. They never listened to me when I spoke and they still don't. I'm interrupted all the time and they just talk over me. I remember coming to school one day and I saw my best friend, and I just broke down in front of everyone in school. I couldn't physically stop crying. I still feel embarrassed over that. This was also around the time I found out my grandfather had cancer. He got better, but then my grandmother got cancer and died and he relapsed and died two months after. I loved them dearly and being with them was like feeling I had actual parents who cared. These were my dads parents. We never really spoke about their deaths. I never saw my mom cry even. I don't think I ever have. My parents continued to scream at me, I went to school like nothing. I'm not sure I even told my friends my grandparents died. And the thing is I had a lot of friends actually, I think people generally like me? I know they thought I was funny to be around, but at the same time the way my parents made me feel unlovable is branded into my brain. Now all I think is that people find me annoying. Also I think I've recognized that I have always \"performed\" a lot in front of friends and that might be why I've lost almost every singe one. I kept them at a distance by not daring to let them in and they left. A part of me also wonder if they saw that deep down something was wring with me, just like my parents told me. I struggle now with that thought more than ever. Well also a year after my grandparents died I was in a bus accident where a classmate died. I didn't know him well but I was next to him and saw the whole thing. I literally stared into his eyes as I saw them unfocus and he was gone. And there was a lot of blood. I went into shock and while the other kids slept together at school and stayed connected I just went home and was lying on the bathroom floor shaking alone. I remember my mother sleeping in my bed and holding me as I was shaking and feeling disgusted by her suddenly showing me warmth. And then I felt guilty for feeling that way. Maybe I was the problem, maybe something was wrong with me. I still wonder that today. Also writing this now feels a lot like this instance might describe a deeper problem here, that I isolate myself and let my mother be there for me, even when I don't want her to, but she has already seen the worst and has such a low opinion of me that I don't care what she sees. To some degree I have slowly isolated myself in my life and have let her be my sole comfort, even though we fight a lot and she gets mad when she can't control me. I've read a bit about both trauma-bonding and I wonder if maybe thats whats happened here. Or maybe I'm overthinking it. \n\nFast forward through high school, things were ok I guess. My struggle with insomnia and anxiety got worse though, home situation still bad. My parents even hit me once or twice. We never talk about that. It was my fault for pushing them so far. And in a way I honestly feel that's true because I was so angry at that time. I also started partying a lot with a large group of friends which was honestly a lot of fun and I don't regret even though we drank a lot. It helped to get away. I like to think I was well liked in general and I did talk to a lot of different friend groups. However this also made me half-way part of every group but not really close enough to keep and I've been bad at staying in touch with anyone so I lost almost all my friends except one childhood friend. She's honestly the best person I know but now because of what happened with my brother I've started to question if even she likes me or feel like he \"has\" to be my friend because I'm such a sad person. Like maybe she's forcing herself to keep in touch just like my brother has apparently. And high school is such a long time ago that I feel embarrassed how my life has progressed so little these past, god eight years... It honestly feels like I'm trapped in a nightmare and even though I try to stay hopeful it feels like its to late for me in many ways to \"start\" my life. Like I'm too far behind. I had so high ambitions but I haven't travelled, dated and barely made any friends. It's like Ive been stuck in this bubble for years just floating around in it alone and I can't get out while my parents knock it around every now and then. I try and try but something in my head keeps holding me back. Everything that seems easy for others is so stressful and hard for me. I tried to study abroad right after high school because I think I desperately needed to get away from home, but looking back I was clearly bruised emotionally from spending a summer at home. I just wanted to get away. However untreated depression, anxiety and trauma is not the best mix for travelling across the ocean alone at 18 and I got severely depressed and had to come back home, I have never been that low mentally. I spent over an entire year in bed after that feeling hopeless. Like there was no way out. Thats when I lost almost all my high school friends. However I picked myself up and started studying something else in a city 8 hours away from home and it was good. Well I had some bad moments, and these moments do make me question if maybe there is something \"wrong\" with me regardless of my parents, as I was able to feel depressed and sad at times when I didn't live with them. Weirdest part is I often called my mother for support, even though I felt worse after talking to her. I don't understand why I did that. I was finally free but I kept feeling like i had to come back home often and call her all the time because I was insecure and lonely. I suppose it's codependency, and that I've shut myself off from friends so much over the years that I felt like i could only be myself with my family, even though it was a version of myself I hated. In many ways I'm still scared to be myself around friends. I'm scared I'll show them my bad sides and they will dislike me or tell me something is wrong with me just like my family. I mean my family know me better than anyone and they dislike me so ho could anyone geniunly like me? I'm trying to get better at this, but it's hard. I lived with two friends in university and it was some drama there because one of the girls was honestly bullying me and had a lot of issues herself. Thank god the rest of the friend group also saw this and assured me I wasn't in fact crazy. I think that girl reminded me so much of my parents and thereby made me feel more hurt than I probably should by the way she treated me. The drama with her made me often call my mom to vent, which just made me feel worse after but I needed to talk to someone. This might have been the first time since elementary school I was in conflict with someone other than my family and I realized I have an extreme issue when it comes to conflicts and discussion with friends. I keep my front up, and I even think they think I seem strong, but afterwards I start shaking. Like physically shaking. With this girl there was a lot of her back talking me to our other friends, but only one instance we actually argued and that was because I had enough of her constant picking on me and I sent her a text. I understand I should have told her directly, but she couldn't handle criticism without getting angry and it honestly scared me. When I got home she physically shouted at me. I asked her to calm down, and she did after a while but the entire thing left me shaking. She much later drunkenly apologized but it still made me realize how fragile I truly am when it comes to these sort of things and how deeply the way I had it at home with my parents affected me. Like how can I get into a relationship or even make new close friends when I can't handle confrontation? Still, my parents voice resonates in my head telling me to get over it and that I'm overreacting. That I'm just so sensitive. \n\nAnd finally back to my brother and that issue. I just wanted to share some of my life struggles I guess to get a better impression of the whole story from my point of view but also because I think i need to get a bit of a better overview myself of my life. Not that all the bad stuff is my entire life, there has been some good stuff too. And I know it's important to focus on that even tough I feel very alone right now. \n\nSo me and my brother have both lived at home jobless for a year and things have gotten more and more tense. I have noticed a shift in his personality and he has gradually become more and more hostile towards me. It's like he's been waking up angry and needed someone to direct that anger at, and he chose me as the easiest outlet. He's picked at every single thing I've done and if I try to tell him something he does he freaks out. He started hiding toiletpaper in his room to bring to the bathroom because he suspected I didn't change the last roll, which I did, and then he began hiding stuff like food our parents bought because he knew I also used it. It's like I don't even recognize him anymore and I can't breathe without him feeling justified getting angry at it. He's usually calm and a chill guy, all his friends and my mom think he's an angel. I never thought so but I've always thought he wouldn't be outright cruel to someone, making this situation mess with mu head because it can't be him who's wrong right? I mean I'm the messed up one as my mother like to say, and now that I think about it, so would he kinda... For a while he's been coming with some rude comments when we talked such as laughing calling me being evil and such, but it was like how you talk between friends so I just laughed it off.  I know my brother well and he is stubborn as hell, and since he's justified treating me this way, he will never admit any fault. Things will not go back to the way they were now. They won't and that's what hurts so much. I have always been the one to \"make up\" after a fight with us and I got sick of it. I got sick of him treating me like shit the past weeks when I hadn't really done anything except little normal things like forgetting some clothes in the bathroom and such. But it seems to be okay for him to leave his sweaty gym clothes on the floor for days, but he freaked out if I forgot a sweater after showering. He's began throwing my clean towels on the floor if he was gong to shower because he wanted to have his towel where I had it. This happened last week and I got mad and asked him about it but he hysterically screamed in my face before I even got to say anything. Now I'm not a saint and I have been pushed too far the last week. I put his dirty workout clothes outside the bathroom and that was apparently it for him. He started throwing all his stuff around on the bathroom floor, threw my towels out in the dirty hallway, and my mom saw it but didn't even say anything to him. She hinted it was my fault. I even asked him what I did specifically lately but he couldn't even give me an answer.  I'd tried to give him some space for a while, but I met him accidentally in the hallway four days ago and the worst fucking fight of my life happened. He hysterically screamed at me and laughed when I tried to defend myself, he screamed every time I tried to say something because he didn't want to hear it. I of course got mad too, I've felt so unfairly treated and sad for a while now while he seems fine with it, and I screamed that he needs to know he started this whole thing and I wouldn't react like the past week if not. He just parrots back that no, it's MY fault and that I started this. I ask again what I did specifically and he can't even say. I feel like I'm going crazy at this point because he's done this a while where he says I do stuff that he's been the one doing. He calls me childish when I obviously think he's been acting insanely childish and irrational lately. And believe me I am aware of how childish and petty and all this entire fight is, I know, which is why it hurts so much that THIS was all he needed apparently to cut contact with me completely and say I'm a horrible person. The fight eventually escalated and he says literally maliciously smiling that these days where he hasn't had to talk to me were the best he's had in so long. I go quiet. He says laughing he's actually disliked me for years. I feel numb but say ok, but know that you pushed me away and you're going to probably regret this one day. He says enthusiastically , almost happy, \"You know what I can live with that! i don't want you in my life anyways\". I have never been this hurt to be honest in my entire life, which is saying a lot, and I'm so hurt I say quietly \"ok, see you in our parents funeral next I guess then..\" and he says \"ok! :)\". I go to my room I break down. I hear him laughing a bit later as he's gaming online. My mom comes up to my room and I try to hide that I'm crying and shaking but she notices. She starts saying that he probably had he's reasons and that I should see things from his perspective and that we need to make up. I know this probably sounds comforting, but there is no comfort in her tone and not what I needed to hear when I'm breaking down. I instantly regret telling her what happened. And its not like I usually can't see things from his point of view, but this time I don't recognize who he's become or his trail of thoughts. And i'm tired. I'm so so tired of always having to be the bigger man and tired of not allowed getting angry when I feel unfairly treated. I'm tired of feeling like I'm always crazy in this family for having an emotional reaction to things. It feels like my mother didn't take the fact that my brother just cut me out of his life seriously at all. I ask her to please leave and she gets angry that I don't want her company. I have to lock the door to be alone and hear her telling my father downstairs that I'm mentally unstable. I just feel so drained right now. The past few days after this I've been in anxiety hell, barely eating, moving or sleeping. Despite going through well, grief, and self doubt I've had to deal with after  losing my relationship with my brother who's been one of the closest people I had in my life and learning he's secretly despised me for the years I thought we were very close, I am also now dealing with my parents on my back constantly. I can't go out of my room because I am so emotionally drained and cannot handle arguing with them right now. My dad is the only one I could sorta talk to and we agreed after the fight that he would drive me to our cabin in the woods so i could get some peace and quiet, but now my mom has manipulated him into thinking I am mentally unstable and can't be alone. I am struggling now, it's true, of course I am, I honestly don't get why it's so weird for them that I'm having an emotional reaction to my brother cutting me out of his life?? Things are so strained at home right now and I feel like i cannot move around freely. I told my father I geniunly feel like i need to be alone from my mother and brother right now and he understood a few days ago but now suddenly he's changed his mind after talking to my mother.. It's also crazy, but I almost never hear my mother laugh. Ever. However these past days I have heard her and my father laugh more than I have in months. They've been fighting a lot lately too and I'm not saying they should be sad just because I am going through hell right now, but its a little weird how everyone suddenly seems more happy now that they know I'm struggling badly and have locked myself in my room. I've felt like this before as well when I was younger and they used me as an emotional punching-bag ,they always seemed more happy after because they could agree that I was the crazy one and they felt \"united\" or something. Got to blow off some steam. My brother told me that when I moved out for uni they fought more than ever. I'm very scared that I come off as the crazy one here since apparently my entire family can't stand me, like my mother said yesterday: \"why do you think noone here likes you? It's not us it's something wrong with\". It's not like I'm not open to having a diagnosis or that something might in fact be wrong with me, but I've just spent so many years convincing myself I'm not in fact overreacting and that parents were in the wrong and its not just all me, but then something like this happens with my brother and I'm spiraling. I guess there is something wrong with me if he, a usually balanced person, also decided I'm unbearable to be around. It makes me question if my closest friends does also see me as some sort of burden really but haven't found a way to tell me over the years just like my brother. Even though they have told me my family is toxic and this isn't normal the times I've caved and confided in them about my homesituation. It's just so crazy because I've always been the one to check up on my brother, even when he knew I had bad anxiety, I took the time to knock on his door and ask how he was doing. Ask about his friends and his life. I know everything about all his friends, he knows nothing about mine. Guess he didn't care to. And it's not like he owes me something of course, but I've always excused it with his passive personality. However now I'm thinking that even all the times we laughed together until we cried, he was faking it. That deep down he has always hated that I bothered him. It's such an unbearable thought because I truly did not see it. I thought he also felt like I was one of his closest persons. I don't know what to do right now. I just need to hear I'm not crazy for having an emotional reaction to all this I guess, but it's probably hard to say that when you guys don't know me. I feel like I'm grieving and I keep hearing all my family laugh more than ever. I've cried more these past days and felt worse than even when my grandparents died. My brother who has honestly to me seemed depressed a long time now (which I have asked him about before and he's denied it) is suddenly super chipper and has reached out to his toxic friend I listened to him vent about for hours and hours (he owed him a LOT of money etc, anyways thats another issue..) and are apparently going to live together with him. He's suddenly had friends over, which he hasn't had all year. A month ago he didn't even want to move out or even apply for school but I urged him to at least apply which he did after a lot of help from me. I am trying to see his side, but I cannot see how I have been the toxic one in his life when I have spent so much time and energy trying to be there for him. However this entire thing has forced me to realize that he has never really truly been there for me. I have always just excused it because I was probably so happy to have a non-toxic familymember in my life. Our mom has often said he's so innocent and a good guy while I'm so manipulative. So guess I am the toxic one? Guess I haven't realized I've done things my brother hates? However he should have said something instead of pretending and letting me think we were close. I think I actually feel really angry and betrayed that he's managed to hurt me to this extent. I'm mad that he's made me feel so worthless and unloved. That all the trauma from my parents now feel magnified. I need to let him go. There is no fixing this. Not for a few years maybe. Right now i need to give him the space he's asked for but also space for me to get myself together and get used to my new reality where I have lost the person I used to confide it the most. I am more alone that ever, but it's also made me realize I relied on him too much. And maybe that's what he hated. My mom went to talk to him on friday and after I asked if he told her what I did to make him like this. She didn't answer my question really but did focus this on herself as usual saying it's sad I went to him for support after me and my mom had fights and talked shit about her. This \"shit\" he usually agreed wholeheartedly with. I guess he's so mad at me he told her about what I said and my mom got mad and chose to focus more on this than the situation between me and my brother. \"well when you went to him to vent you forced him to say something bad about his own mother\", I just left right then. I physically felt I couldn't anymore. And lately I've been hearing my mom and my brother have a much better relationship. Like they're pals. I don't think I really ever wanted to get in between them or anything, I just desperately needed to be listened to after the horrible verbal fights I had with my mother from time to time. Guess he didn't want to listen to me, but I must say he's a hell of a good actor then, because he said a lot about her being toxic as well. Anyways, it's fine. I'm hurt, but they can have each other. Before when I thought about cutting ties with my parents I always imagined my sweet, caring innocent brother being alone with them and noone to talk to and felt bad, but now I can at least stop giving a shit about that. However even as I'm writing this I still feel concern for my brother. Ugh. I hate that I love him even when he seems to hate me. I hate that I care so much and feel so deeply when the rest of my family don't care. I hate that it's going to take me a long time to recover from this while my brother seems to be thriving already without me. I know it will get better one day, and I'm trying to hold on to that small exiting feeling that maybe this is a chance to start completely on my own. Then I feel guilty for leaving my father behind... Maybe I'll have some contact with him. Idk. \n\nI feel like I need to trust myself and that I am in fact a good person with a lot of empathy, I am just sick, tired and bruised from this situation making me lash out at home in ways I never would have with anyone else. Like I think I mentioned, the past few days my mother has also started getting on my back again ever since she saw me cry. Because crying is a sign something is extremely wrong right? Well maybe to someone who doesn't even cry at funerals... She's talked behind my back constantly lately to my father telling him I'm sick and need help. My brother apparently heard this and started egging them on. Takes the blame off of them right? Now they don't have to take responsibility for the fights we've had because I was mentally ill all along so thats the \"fault\". So now I am dealing with all of them treating me like a crazy person just because I am hurting right now, which my mother likes to remind me every time she sees me, which has resulted in me hiding in my room for three days because I do not have the emotional capacity to deal with her right now on top of everything with my brother which I need to process. I need time to heal. To rest. I want to see a therapist, I have asked my parents for money for it several times before, feeling guilty about it but I knew I needed it, and they refused. Now however, they're blaming me for not going to therapy before and \"fixing\" myself. I feel so enraged by this. They know I do not have money and i have even wanted this for a long time. They found this one \"spiritual healer\" person online because a friend of my brother recommended her (I am  btw not comfortable with that my brother is telling people I apparently need help), and they decided while I took a walk yesterday that I am going to go to her. I have told them I want to go to therapy, but I would like to chose the therapist. My father said of course and understand this, but my mother is saying I'm refusing therapy just because I'm not choosing the same thing she is. It's always been this way with her and if she doesn't get what she wants she threatens me. Same pattern every time. At this point I 'm geniunly scared she might start going further and begin saying to my father I should be put in a mental hospital or something. I don't trust her. Actually me and my father had a long talk a few days ago right after the fight with my brother and I asked if he could drive me to out cabin in the woods, and he said yes. I said I needed to get out of the house, he understood. The day after my mother convinced him I was too mentally unstable to go and now he's parroting her. It's so frustrating. I feel like I can't move or breathe in this house anymore and all I want is to be away a bit to gather my feelings but I'm not allowed to. It's like whenever my mother sees me weak she starts pushing on me to see be break. I just don't know anymore. Like I said I'm not denying that I am depressed, have anxiety and want help. But I've had this for years and had to deal with it alone. Like I told them straight up when they said I should be at home because I shouldn't be alone, \"whats different from being there or here? I'm alone and have to deal with it alone anyways, it's always been that way, this time is no different.\" I know that was rude and all, but I got so fed up. I just don't know what to do. I need space to get emotionally kinda stable again so I can get a job and get out of here. Also I asked my doctor the other day if she could refer me to a therapist, but she said she doesn't think I need it and wrote me some antidepressants instead. At first I thought nope not taking pills, but now I'm wondering if I should. I just feel so hurt, and maybe I'll take the pills and realize I was actually acting crazy after all?\n\nSorry this got so long, I didn't know really where I was going with it. If someone actually bothered to read this, know I am very grateful to even be heard. It's mostly a rant, but any comments would be apprictiated. Not sure how coherent this text is and I apologize for that. I just needed to get it all out right away before I exploded and I just feel so lost right now and could use anyones perspective or advice at this point no matter what it may be. Thank you"

I want to know if there is something wrong with me or if more people experience this.\n\nIf I inssuflate a line of 3fpm not even that big maybe like 30mg, when it kicks in i feel sort of a intense euphoric peaceful feeling and also very relaxed. Even though it is a stimulant I become very lethargic and relaxed on it. I just keep staring at the wall and my whole body and mind just feel euphoric. This euphoria is actually somewhat comparable to rolling on mdma but without the whole love and hugs thing. (I'm pretty sure I'm not accidentally taking mdma.) Other people are saying like 'oh i only experience a little energy boost on it', but for me its always just straight up euphoria.\n\nI also have a lot of experience with vaping this substance. I hotrail it of of foil and what this does it just kicks in right when you inhale it and what happens for me is experience just a wave of relaxation and euphoria everytime I inhale.\n\nIn my friendgroup a lot of people have experience with taking 3fpm and all of them seem to need a really large amount to feel something close to the effects Im describing. Only a few people I met love 3fpm as much as I do. It's really weird how different te reactions to this substance seem to be.\n\nI'm really curious to know about the experiences of people here with 3fpm in regards to euphoria. I'm legit worried that what I'm consuming might be something completely else than 3fpm. I've ordered 3fpm a handful of times from different sellers and the effect seemed to be the same for every batch I think."

Because they hear a lot of people talking about introverts and extroverts and not ambiverts. \n\nThis is only the case because ambiverts aren't really all that interesting of a subject because those are just normal people. So actually those 'I'm an ambivert' people are just saying that they can enjoy alone time but can also enjoy parties. I know very few people who generally hate all social interactions or can't be alone at all. \n\nAlso I know that this is stupid and people are complex and trying to put them in boxes like this isn't really the best way of describing people but this one just annoys me."

I also have a type 5 enneagram which is not common with ENTP(from what I know, but the two systems are not the same so that would not make me non ENTP if in all actuality I am). I can be fairly introverted and I like low sensation environments(I love retreating to dark places that are nice and quiet and I absolutely hate crowds lines and stores). I can also happen to be eccentric and chatty like ENTP(usually about certain topics or if I am messing with people). I have heard ENTPs are the most introverted extroverts so maybe that could be me.

Once in class we were examining the text \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d along with one of Shakespeares poems and I came up with a whole idea based around what he truly meant and how people misinterpreted the true meaning by using his separate ideas and works. \n\n\u2022I am very lazy but manage to pass school.\n\n\u2022 Once when I pulled a card in elementary school for bad conduct my response to the teacher was \u201cI like yellow I think it\u2019s a nice color.\u201d I was a smart ass.\n\n\u2022I would consider myself to have bad memory and I like staying in my head thinking of possibilities or new ideas I also enjoy reading during School.\n\n\u2022Enneagram is 5w4. \n\n\u2022I am learning guitar and I enjoy art.\n\nAsk any questions and I hope none of this was irrelevant."

Traditionally, it\u2019s a barbed wire pattern as made famous by Yassar Arafat of Palestinian origin and they\u2019re traditionally white with the black pattern. Many adaptations and color variations have surfaced since then; some of which do possess a color-related significance. White is traditionally Palestinian. Red and white is traditionally Saudi (and additionally worn by Muslims of other origin who have made the hajj to Mecca). Green is just a broad-based color of Islam that spans Muslims countries not occupied or controlled by fuckfaces like ISIS or the Taliban/aQ, and additionally many Iranians will wear green. Black without the barbed pattern is traditional for mujahideen Taliban, the OG Taliban, that is. Brown variants are generally Maghreb or NW Africa like Moroccan Berber\u2019s. Urban Moroccans will wear a lot of red (and if they can find it) with green barbs. I\u2019ve seen some Libyans wear light blue. \n\nThe style of the shemaghs we find in the US are definitely varied. I\u2019ve seen some with tiny embroidered grenades and Gadsden flags on them for example. AR15s. Skulls. Shit like that. Obviously those aren\u2019t traditional shemaghs.",

Passed state inspection today. Our state requires inspections. (Quick background, my wife and I bought this car in 2006. It\u2019s an xA. Zoom ahead 16 years and I\u2019ve since retired from the Marine Corps. Four kids later we barely drove it for practical reasons, but just never sold it because it\u2019s pretty awesome little hatchback.) \n\nI want to stance/camber this thing so bad. Like totally turn it into a ridiculous toy. New paint. Remove the wipers. Murder it out. I\u2019m bored and need a project and this sounds like fun. Things like removing the wipers wouldn\u2019t let it pass inspection here to my knowledge. But I see people here with MO plates driving shit like this all the time and they seem to have current inspections. So what\u2019s the trick? Is there a special \u201cshow car\u201d category where road and safety inspections aren\u2019t necessary? I\u2019m trying to do this for the fun of it, but also be able to drive it three miles to and from work everyday legally. (Speaking of work, I drive a school bus now. That also sounds like a cool project! Lol) Thanks for reading.\n\nEdit: not really sure the downvotes here. I\u2019m asking a genuine question. If the answer is, \u201cyou need to find the \u2018right\u2019 mechanic\u201d just fucking say it. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just looking for the answer. I am really interested in building cars like this and have my oldest son involved with me in doing so and let him benefit from them. I\u2019m footing the bill. He\u2019s a car guy and I\u2019m not. This is a way for us to connect. JFC. It\u2019s a simple question. Are the inspectors your personal buddies or not? I don\u2019t care what the answer is. I\u2019m looking for an avenue of approach."

The last couple of months I am recovering. I have my sick benefit for 3 more months to either find a job here or go back to my country.  \n\nIn the meantime, we had the pandemic and my 3year girlfriend became insecure & toxic to a point we needed to break up 1 month ago. That devastated me and I am still grieving.\n\nMy family is broke so they can't send me money and now I have to apply for jobs while I do courses to stay relevant and update my CV (I work in finance). \n\nSometimes I feel I can't take it from the pressure and I am waking up at nights. Sometimes I get depressed that I am a failure. I do therapy,and I started a gym membership, but I don't know if would help. Everything collapsed in 1,5 year.\n\nHas anyone had a crushing situation like this before, a perfect storm? How did you overcome it? Any advice is welcome. Thanks"

I tried making something completely original but I couldn't like any of the stuff I had done, but this was something I could get behind.\n\nThere are a handful of humans that were hired by the elves who dwell on the island to fight other elves, when the fight was over they weren't satisfied with the reward of land, so they took more and continued to do so over the years until the elves only occupied the lands to the west and north. Now these humans tribes are facing invaders of their own, dwarves seeking more fertile and prosperous lands from across the sea. If you know a bit of history, you'll see how these humans are following on the tracks of the Angles, Saxons and Jutes, how the elves are based on the celtic tribes and the dwarves on the vikings.\n\nI'm wondering whether or not I should scrap it, go back to the drawing board and try to do something that's more inspired on history rather than copy and paste stuff or not.

Any suggestions?\n\nPS: English isn't my first language and this is probably the first world I'm actually intending to start and finish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n https://imgur.com/pLl94bY "

My guy is only 2 months old so i expect him to be skittish. The first time i picked him up he completely almost freaked out (no masking or pooping tho) and tried his damn hardest to wiggle away.  I had to handle low over a big tub just in case he would manage to fling himself off. After a while he just got tired i guess and just coiled around my hand and chilled there.  The second time however, when i picked him up, he only freaked out a bit at start, but then he completely calmed down to the point he was hardly holding on me. Just lazily kind of moving while i was putting one hand in front of the other for him to slither across. Funnily enough the second time felt almost as \"stressful\" to me cause he really made no effort to properly support himself lol.\n\nSo just wanted to ask people if it's just too early to expect things to go smoothly, or is it just a matter of me being inexperienced? I'm seeing lots of lovely photos of babies just hanging around on top of stuff, palms etc and i have no idea how people can keep them so calm lol.  Thank you for any replies\\~"

I've re-bought the game recently and trying to catch up.\n\nNow, from what i read on iron golems so far, they seem to spawn where a certain amount of villagers withing a base/post is met? However twice until now i got iron golems walking randomly into my post and chilling around.\n\nThe first time that happened i had 4 villagers (lost two during a raid and the golem aswell) and the second time i only had two villagers... The golem did not spawn. I saw them walking from across the mountains slowly  making their way to my base...So my question is; Is this a common thing? Do i miss something very obvious?

I was BEYOND RELIEVED to not have to parent 3 children with serious, serious, (I mean textbook concerning) behaviors anymore. I understand where you\u2019re coming from. \n\n*HOWEVER* if his kids came back to me at any point in the future and said \u201cHey, you coming into our lives and then out of it felt like being abandoned, and it really hurt us,\u201d I would be able to acknowledge and own that without defensiveness. It\u2019s not kids\u2019 fault when their parents raise them to be unlikeable. Consider letting go of some of the behaviors of SMALL CHILDREN and being willing to apologize for hurting them when they were little, even if you were glad to escape. You don\u2019t have to justify leaving the marriage but you could acknowledge that there was some collateral damage to arguably innocent parties. And no they probably do NOT remember how he coached them to treat you. \n\nMaybe TA. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

In 2019, my parents sent both of us to different wilderness programs, him to Aspiro and me to Pacific Quest. My wilderness experience is unrelated, so I won't be sharing much about it. I'm not very close with my brother, mostly because he doesn't open up or talk to anyone in our family very much. But I can tell he is in a very dark place right now. He is still living at home with no direction in life, working long hours at a car manufacturing plant where we think he gets bullied. He has severe self-esteem issues, and because of his autism I think he struggles to relate to others, and people make fun of him for it. In his off-hours, he spends all of his time either on his computer or sleeping. He has gone to college a few times and dropped out, losing passion for the programs he went into. He struggles with independence as well and relies on my mom to get him up each morning and make his lunches for work.\n\nMy family and I so desperately want to help him, but wilderness traumatized the shit out of him. He already struggles to open up and face his emotions, but wilderness made it 10x worse. He told my mom that he felt like he was brainwashed while being in that program. He has not since trusted any therapist except for a family friend who is a hypnotherapist. But he has stopped seeing her and she never seemed to really help him. My family and I are all so worried about him but don't know how to help him.\n\nHas anyone gone through something similar? If so, how did you get out of it? Also, does anyone have general advice for this situation? I just want to see him thrive :(\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for all the helpful responses. I get overwhelmed easily so I don\u2019t think I can respond to them all, but remember that I see you, I hear you, and I appreciate you. I\u2019m feeling hopeful for my brother :\u2019)"

It works, but when I want to do it again on the same sheet, pulling the formula tab and writing MEAN doesn't work, if the cell has already calculated a mean. The formula tab would just show the cell to enter, killing the macro.  \n\n\nI would like to make a simple if statement, saying that if the cell contains already a number, to skip the MEAN part.  For some reason when writing in Pulover, the code goes like this missing the parenthesis.  \n\n\n    /*\n    Send, {Control Down}{c}{Control Up}\n    Sleep, 100\n    If clipboard not contains (number\n    {\n        */\n        Send, {Shift Down}{F3}{Shift Up}\n        Sleep, 100\n        SendRaw, MOYENNE\n        Sleep, 100\n        Send, {Enter}\n        Sleep, 100\n        Send, {Down}\n        Sleep, 100\n        Send, {Enter}\n        Sleep, 100\n        Send, {Control Down}{Left}{Control Up}\n        Sleep, 100\n        Send, {Left}\n        Sleep, 100\n        Send, {Backspace}\n        Sleep, 100\n        Send, {Control Down}{v}{Control Up}\n        Sleep, 100\n        Send, {Enter}\n        Sleep, 100\n        Send, {Control Down}{c}{Control Up}\n        Sleep, 100\n        /*\n    }\n    Else\n    {\n    }\n    */\n\nI have sucessfully used something similar previously like :\n\n    If clipboard contains _\n\nLooking at the AHK documentation it tells me to just write the variable like (this) but it doesn't work.

I have considered the worst outcome when it comes to friendship (well if that friend hates me and doesn't want me, then that's NOT the end of the world I guess) which helped me tremendously, but how about family? Especially since that in Asia the importance of family is very strong, there is like this sacred bond or invisible, strong blood bond.... That I don't really feel much, actually. I  feel slight closeness with my brother.\n\nBut how about your cherished ones? Would you be willing to part with someone loved, imagine the possibility of them having suddenly a bad relationship with you, with the person breaking off the relationship? How about family that you can't really break off? \n\nIs it truly outcome independant, stoic and healthy if you prepare yourself to endure disowning your parents / close friends, or, let's flip it, your child (if I were a parent), because things have gone so badly ? Would it be fair for the other party?\n\nIt seems to me that caring and being outcome independant, is a dichotomy. Can you do both at the same time? By definition, it seems to me that being outcome independant is about caring less, or preparing yourself for the worst possibility and realizing it's fine, or you'll manage it, and thus your worst fears would stay healthy when realized.\n\nIt's somehow important as I wonder how to deal with estranging parents, and close friends, if that were to happen. How can I form a close bond of friendship and simultaneously be prepared to break it off?"

I became homeless, but thankfully my dad and grandma let me stay at their place for as long as I need which I'm really grateful for. The plan I made was to find a job and save up for a while until I can afford my own place...\nI've been thinking everything through and realistically it's going to be really hard for me to afford my own flat, given that without a degree I would just be stuck with a basic minimum wage job. I want to go back to college for a year and get the qualifications I need, that way I could be able to enter university and get a degree in something. I could also work part time jobs along studying, and get uni accommodation whilst I'm there.\nI think this is a good idea, but my only problem is I'm really nervous to bring the idea up to them. I feel like by me saying this, it's overstepping my welcome. I don't want to come across as rude to them. If I go along with this, then that means living with them for a longer period of time. And I don't want them to think I'm taking them for granted or anything.\nI'm pretty quiet here because I don't want to get in the way, or be annoying, or seem like a burden to them. I'm so nervous and don't even know how to bring it up to them. I just really don't want to push my luck with them Incase they say no."

I've heard about some of these fake call apps out there and was wondering if there was one worth using and would be kind of believable (well at least to a 6 year old).

At age 16, while on vacation in 2019, I started having bellyaches and blood in my stool. A lot of it. When I first went to the hospital for the internal bleedings, they said they were caused by iron deficiency and refused to try a colonoscopy. They gave me iron supplements, which magically solved the issue entirely for a while. Then, a few months later. I got sick again and the doctor decided to try a colonoscopy anyway. That's when they concluded I had UC, but they said it wasn't much of an issue and as long as I'd watch my diet + took Mesalazine granules every day I'd be fine and I'd live a very normal life. These meds helped very well for approximately one to two years, which lead me to believe this UC thing would never come back and indeed wasn't something I'd ever have to worry about. Like breaking an arm, once it's healed it's healed. I didn't know what flares were, and I basically got no guidance in this at all. Then, in late 2021 when I was 17 I got extremely sick, blood in the stool again but this time also pains that were so horrible I couldn't walk anymore. The hospital dismissed my request to visit a doctor and said the flare would go away if I'd just stick to Mesalazine. On day 3 of the pains, I couldn't take it anymore and my dad called a taxi to rush me to the ER. I was sweating, had a fever and my skin was white-greenish. In the ER, they just gave me morphine and said nothing was wrong (they basically concluded nothing was wrong when they saw I wasn't pregnant) and I should go home. \"Probably just menstrual or ovulation pains\". I insisted something was wrong, because these stabbing pains were INSANE and even worse than the worst periods I'd ever had! To please me, they kept me in the hospital for 1 night for some extra tests. The next morning, I heard I had food poisoning (campylobacter) on top of a severe flare (calprotectin +7000) and I had to stay in the hospital for a while. They gave me prednisone infusions and antibiotics, which solved the issue in a few days.\nAs of today, I'm doing better. I'm 19 now and started biologics earlier this year (I failed Infliximab after 1 month but Remicade seems to be doing its job quite well so far). This bad experience in the hospital hasn't been my first, I often feel like the doctors have no clue what they're doing. I learned more on this subreddit than from any specialist who studied for it... And my hospital is seen as one of the best in the country, which makes me believe that switching hospitals will absolutely not solve this problem..."

Today, I wanted to make some final changes to the song just to find out Logic messed up the project out of nowhere. Some midi layers are off-key, others have been straight up deleted, some drums have been changed into synths and the other way around, other layers seem to be in-tact but don't have sound and cannot be moved to another layer anymore. What the hell happened? Is my song lost forever now or can I somehow fix this? Please know I'm don't know the ins-and-outs of this program yet, so any technical talk is probably gonna be very hard for me to understand, but I will try my best to get it. Damn I feel horrible."

I\u2019m very used to the Rosary that tends to fill up every gap in my mind with thoughts of the Divine: meditation on a specific mystery for an easy amount of time to maintain, all while asking for the Theotokos\u2019 intercession and help with meditating.  So, the Jesus Prayer leaves me feeling a bit like a ship without a sail.  I understand the simplicity of it, making it easy to recite and pray much more often and in more situations.  (The Rosary sort of requires a more intense focus, but I\u2019ve heard of some Roman Catholic nuns praying the Rosary, as a group, while they work together, which sounds manageable, if you have someone in charge of leading it/counting the prayers while the rest recite and work).\n\nThe trouble I run into with the Jesus Prayer is the repetition absent a guided point of meditation like the Rosary has.  I understand talking to Jesus is good, and the content of the Jesus Prayer kind of highlights that it\u2019s good to implore Jesus for His mercy, constantly, but it\u2019s hard for me to maintain it as a true prayer of the heart for longer periods of time.

                "body": "I\u2019ve been a Catholic for about 10 years, now, (a convert).  And I have heard a great many things about what is happening, on the metaphysical level, at Holy Mass.\n\nRecently, however, I\u2019ve been really diving into what it means on a sacrificial level, and I\u2019d like to share my understanding, here, for two reasons:  First, selfishly, to see if my understanding is flawed or insufficient in any way.  Second, to share with anyone who will listen what has taken me a decade to understand.\n\nSo, when God became Man, He made a numerically singular sacrifice on the cross to the Father as the once-and-for-all sacrifice for all sin.  On the cross, He manifested every single virtue.  It was the ultimate act of worship.  This singular self-offering of His very life is \u201csuperabundant,\u201d as St. Thomas says, capable of remitting not just every sin, past, present, and future, but capable of remitting even sins that have never and will never be committed.  Catholics are told that this singular sacrifice is the very same sacrifice that we, together with Christ, are offering to the Father when we pray Holy Mass.\n\nBUT, this offering is made in a memorial fashion after the words of Our Lord to \u201cdo this IN MEMORY of me\u201d because Our Lord only died once, and His Body has been in tact, and glorified, sitting at the right hand of the Father since His Ascension.  It is THIS Body that is made present to us in the Holy Eucharist, and in a very specific way.  Christ\u2019s Body is in Heaven, and it is a glorified, resurrected Body.  When the Holy Spirit changes the substance of our offering of bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Our Lord (exclusively through the action of a valid priest or bishop), it is Christ\u2019s Body, which NEVER leaves Heaven, that is made present to us on earth; hence the description of the Liturgy as being \u201cheaven on earth.\u201d\n\nSo, when the priest, on the part of himself and all the faithful in attendance offers the consecrated host and chalice to the Father as a sacrifice, he is literally offering Christ\u2019s *resurrected* and *glorified* Body to the Father, and this sacrifice is the same sacrifice as the one that occurred on the cross, in time, because Christ\u2019s resurrected and glorified Body is a sign of and sort of a reward for, Christ\u2019s virtue manifested on the cross.\n\nSo, the sense in which Mass is the same sacrifice Christ offered on the cross is a memorial sense; sort of an action of reminding the ourselves of what Jesus did on the cross (praying Mass \u201cin memory\u201d of Jesus) and \u201crepresenting\u201d that same sacrifice to the Father in the form of Christ\u2019s forever-alive, glorified, and never-dying Body in heaven at the Father\u2019s right hand as a sign of what Jesus did, in time, on the cross, once and for all.  \n\nAnd the sense in which Mass is the Real Presence of Christ, His Body made substantially present to us as food, is a more literal and present-in-time sense.  Christ\u2019s Body, which never leaves Heaven, even at the consecration, is made present to us to eat in a very mystical way.  (I believe I once heard this means that the only time people ate Christ\u2019s *non-resurrected* flesh was at the Last Supper).\n\nI often hear Catholics describe Mass as if it makes us just as present at the foot of the cross as Our Lady or St. John were, but I think describing Mass in that way, specifically, is incorrect.  What do you think?"

I choose my words in my head before speaking, so there is often a pause of a few seconds before I speak, to think about the question, think about an answer that is correct, and finally choose the words to use. Even then, I tend to speak in somewhat short or simple sentences (otherwise, they would be more likely to be incorrect), so I\u2019m really bad at finding the right words.\n\nThis happens with everyone outside of my close family (with whom I have developed reflexes of communication, I suppose that\u2019s why it\u2019s easier), even acquaintances my age (23), but even more so with authority figures, and people who are important to me. Although I suppose communicating with important people is stressful for everyone, I don\u2019t think the fear and anxiety of saying something wrong is as bad as it is with me.\n\nFor example, in a Facebook group, someone posted a message about looking for a piano teacher. I responded saying I was one, and my response was not very stressful to write (only a little), because the person and I hadn\u2019t started talking one-on-one yet, so when I responded, their message was still, in my mind, a message addressed to a large group of possible people, and so it wasn\u2019t personal. Another reason is that, being among the first messages of a conversation, my message had a lot of kind of generic elements, that I have used with other people, that I know have been well received, and that I have perfected over time. In this case, I even did a bit of stalking of that person, to know how to word a specific part of the message so that it suited him best.\n\nHowever, the moment I saw that the person responded, it was like things started being real, the person had responded to *me* and the countdown for the reply I had to send back had started. Even worse was that he had mentioned a possible time to meet the day after in the afternoon, which meant I had to send back a well-worded reply by that evening. All of this was too stressful for me and I started procrastinating replying back and trying not to think of it because it scared me so much. I did that till 1 PM the next day, avoiding it, being even more afraid as time passed that the person would be getting angry not receiving any reply, and thinking of the possible excuses I could say so that he wouldn\u2019t be angry. I tried to tell myself what I imagined my therapist would tell me: most people don\u2019t get angry so fast, they are understanding, there are plenty of reasons why one could need some time before replying; but I didn\u2019t manage to be reassured and kept falling back into my fears.\n\nI then checked my inbox and saw that the person had sent a message at 12:57, just to specify that he had contacted his wife and she was very happy also to meet me. This was such a lifesaver for me, it provided an opportunity to reply back somewhat \u00ab\u00a0naturally\u00a0\u00bb again, sort of in the flow of the conversation, without an interruption of more than 12 hours where my fear had become too important not to appear in a sincere and authentic message, leaving me with the only solution of being unauthentic and finding a very \u00ab\u00a0plausible-to-normal-people\u00a0\u00bb wording to send back. Luckily, thanks to his second message, this wasn\u2019t the case, and I was also very much reassured knowing their feelings (his wife was \u00ab\u00a0as happy as he is\u00a0\u00bb; his wording was also very warm, he ended with \u00ab\u00a0see you very soon\u00a0\u00bb).\n\nSo I gathered up my courage and after much wording and rewording, I managed to send back a reply. I did notice that I was albeit a tiny bit less thorough than I first was, because I was thinking that he was a nice person and would probably not get angry. But now his reply comes and there are tiny little details that make me scared and make me regret not having been thorough. Maybe I said something that was inappropriate? Maybe I worded my message weirdly? (I\u2019m socially awkward I suppose)\n\nSo anyway, I got scared again and thought \u00ab\u00a0not again\u00a0\u00bb and now I\u2019m writing here in the hopes of finding a solution. I was worrying but I actually feel much better now having written all this. (I hope it didn\u2019t bore you too much by the way, sorry it\u2019s so long)\nThe fact that I\u2019m feeling better now, as if I wrote all this to someone, reminds me of something I noticed : if I say or write something that has been \u00ab\u00a0validated\u00a0\u00bb by someone else, I don\u2019t feel worried or scared at all, even if the person\u2019s reply is not what I was expecting, because I feel backed up by the person who validated me, and I say and write those things with a lot more trust and lightheartedness.\n\nI think I should specify some things about me that surely explain all this : I have known physical and emotional abuse from my mother from before the age of 5, it was pretty rough. She would beat me for answering wrong and misbehaving (accidents like spilling things), she\u2019s pretty strict. My biggest fear responses are freeze and fawn (I\u2019m a huge people-pleaser). I\u2019m on antidepressants and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety (I think? It\u2019s a clinical diagnosis so I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s official). I have been sheltered for a lot of my life and started learning how to socialise quite late. I keep to myself and spend a lot of time in my head. I like to imagine things and daydream.\n\nSorry again for the very long post! I think I just needed to get this off my chest, but if some of you have some advice or helpful words, I would really really appreciate it. \ud83d\udc95\nThank you so much!"

                "body": "[TW: physical abuse only at the end]\n\nHello\u2026\n\nI\u2019m writing here because this has been going on for so, so long, and I don\u2019t know how to deal with it. \n\nWhen I\u2019m talking to someone, I am extremely conscious of and careful about what I\u2019m saying. I choose my words in my head before speaking, so there is often a pause of a few seconds before I speak, to think about the question, think about an answer that is correct, and finally choose the words to use. Even then, I tend to speak in somewhat short or simple sentences (otherwise, they would be more likely to be incorrect), so I\u2019m really bad at finding the right words.\n\nThis happens with everyone outside of my close family (with whom I have developed reflexes of communication, I suppose that\u2019s why it\u2019s easier), even acquaintances my age (23), but even more so with authority figures, and people who are important to me. Although I suppose communicating with important people is stressful for everyone, I don\u2019t think the fear and anxiety of saying something wrong is as bad as it is with me.\n\nFor example, in a Facebook group, someone posted a message about looking for a piano teacher. I responded saying I was one, and my response was not very stressful to write (only a little), because the person and I hadn\u2019t started talking one-on-one yet, so when I responded, their message was still, in my mind, a message addressed to a large group of possible people, and so it wasn\u2019t personal. Another reason is that, being among the first messages of a conversation, my message had a lot of kind of generic elements, that I have used with other people, that I know have been well received, and that I have perfected over time. In this case, I even did a bit of stalking of that person, to know how to word a specific part of the message so that it suited him best.\n\nHowever, the moment I saw that the person responded, it was like things started being real, the person had responded to *me* and the countdown for the reply I had to send back had started. Even worse was that he had mentioned a possible time to meet the day after in the afternoon, which meant I had to send back a well-worded reply by that evening. All of this was too stressful for me and I started procrastinating replying back and trying not to think of it because it scared me so much. I did that till 1 PM the next day, avoiding it, being even more afraid as time passed that the person would be getting angry not receiving any reply, and thinking of the possible excuses I could say so that he wouldn\u2019t be angry. I tried to tell myself what I imagined my therapist would tell me: most people don\u2019t get angry so fast, they are understanding, there are plenty of reasons why one could need some time before replying; but I didn\u2019t manage to be reassured and kept falling back into my fears.\n\nI then checked my inbox and saw that the person had sent a message at 12:57, just to specify that he had contacted his wife and she was very happy also to meet me. This was such a lifesaver for me, it provided an opportunity to reply back somewhat \u00ab\u00a0naturally\u00a0\u00bb again, sort of in the flow of the conversation, without an interruption of more than 12 hours where my fear had become too important not to appear in a sincere and authentic message, leaving me with the only solution of being unauthentic and finding a very \u00ab\u00a0plausible-to-normal-people\u00a0\u00bb wording to send back. Luckily, thanks to his second message, this wasn\u2019t the case, and I was also very much reassured knowing their feelings (his wife was \u00ab\u00a0as happy as he is\u00a0\u00bb; his wording was also very warm, he ended with \u00ab\u00a0see you very soon\u00a0\u00bb).\n\nSo I gathered up my courage and after much wording and rewording, I managed to send back a reply. I did notice that I was albeit a tiny bit less thorough than I first was, because I was thinking that he was a nice person and would probably not get angry. But now his reply comes and there are tiny little details that make me scared and make me regret not having been thorough. Maybe I said something that was inappropriate?

It's not for everyone; too much of a cult for me personally but whatever floats your goat.\n\nDon't fool yourself into thinking you're \"almost clean\" or \"about to quit\"; you have to take action in the present to change your situation and be painfully real with yourself. Procrastinating only makes it worse, as every drug binge makes you more inclined to do another. You know how the dopamine system works.Compare it to an obese person saying they're *about* to lose weight while ordering pizza.\n\nDon't plan to quit some other time in the distant future. Write down a plan to quit imminently as well as reasons to do it and **stick with it**.Put it on your fridge or in your phone so you can look at it every day and stay motivated.\n\nThe first 3 months sucked the most for me. Prepare to feel like you're on a split personality bipolar rollercoaster as you're rediscovering your actual self.Have a help line for the lows, and don't be afraid to call NSPL if you get to that point.\n\nFor me it was 100% worth it, although it certainly didn't feel that way at first.I'm starting to feel like life's okay again and taking interest in normal, sober activities suitable for high sensation seekers; Motorcycles, target practice and all that.\n\nThe best part of it all is the ego boost. If you love cocaine like I did, you'll probably enjoy that aspect. Chatting up coworkers, making friends, having the courage to pick up women...\n\nMaking sober friends that actually do shit rather than sit around in front of a TV doing hard drugs, smoking weed or drinking beer helps immensely.\n\nI still crave drugs every single week. It's the way it is, it's the way it's gonna be. Don't cave in. Good luck and happy birthday!",

I'm trying to be more active, trying to improve my sleep hygiene, all of that...\n\nBut one thing I can't figure out is that any time I get a full eight hours of sleep, it almost guarantees I won't be able to fall asleep the next night at the same time, or I'm likely to wake up in the middle of the night. \n\nThe obvious answer might be that I only need 6 or 7 hours of sleep, but I never feel rested with less than 7.5 - 8 hours.\n\nIt just feels like torture where the only way to guarantee I fall asleep at night without drugs is to keep myself perpetually sleep deprived.\n\nIt's pretty typical for me to start out each week with horrible insomnia due to me daring to get 8hrs of sleep the previous night.

He describes the chest tightness as feeling like he can't take a full, satisfying breath. His nose is stuffed, but not runny.  He has no other symptoms-- no cough, mucus, wheezing, or anything like that.\n\nHis symptoms are constant. They sometimes get worse, but they never go away. They aren't affected at all by the seasons or exercise.\n\nHe's been to the doctor many times now and they've said his lungs sound good. He's had a chest x-ray, a pulmonary function test, and a CT scan of his sinuses and everything has come back as normal.\n\nHe's been prescribed antibiotics, steroids, many OTC allergy meds, and inhalers with Flovent and Albuterol and nothing has helped. He takes daily Flonase, but doesn't notice a difference. The only thing that has helped his nose so far is Sinex, but he can't take it too frequently. He's had a submucosal resection that didn't help.\n\nThe doctors are currently treating this as an allergy problem. He got an allergy test that showed that he was very slightly allergic to ragweed and cockroaches. He is currently getting allergy shots, but we're skeptical that those could be the cause as allergy medications give him no relief, his symptoms don't improve in the winter, and we have no cockroaches.\n\nOther info: He smoked cigarettes for 7-8 years, then switched to vaping for 2 years. The symptoms started about 2 months after he quit vaping. He works laying brick and stone and does woodworking as a hobby, so he comes in contact with a lot of dust. Wouldn't the doctors have figured that out if that was the issue though?\n\nAny help is very appreciated!!"

We matched on a dating site and we started texting.  He asked me what I was doing and me being honest, I told him I was smoking weed on the patio with some friends who were at my house.\n\nYou would have thought I told him I was doing heroin with strangers.  He told me it wasn\u2019t \u201csafe\u201d to travel with illegal drugs and I shouldn\u2019t trust anything that comes from the black market.  He told me he didn\u2019t like that I did that.\n\nWhich\u2026okay, fair.  Not everyone is into it and doesn\u2019t want to be around it.  If it\u2019s a deal breaker it\u2019s no skin off my nose.  The problem I had was him lecturing me about it.  He told me I need to get a medical card (super expensive and not always provided for the reason I smoke) and if I can\u2019t, I need to stop smoking it and \u201cfind other ways to cope with life.\u201d  Dude, I didn\u2019t ask.  \n\nIt would have been fine had he said \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of weed and the risk it brings so we aren\u2019t compatible.\u201d  I didn\u2019t need a whole lecture like I\u2019m 6 and I got caught doing something bad.

The way I play DS2 is by making a single SL838 character with all covenants rank 3 and the rest will be only SL150 builds dedicated for pvp (the two mentioned covenants) only. I am just about finished with my SL838 character, I've got everything, over 50 Loyce Souls and all covenants to rank 3 except the two in the title.\n\nMy character is about SL300 now and I decided to farm to SL838 now before I play some more Brotherhood of Blood matches. Maybe you've played against me, it was yesterday, I played about 50 matches with a Ruler's Sword and Mad Warrior Armor. I am SorenVC.\n\nBut since I'm now farming for SL838 I was wondering what was the most toxic op build to win every game (asking for a friend of course). If I ever get stuck dealing with the same enemy, I want to know a solution. A final solu- just kidding.\n\nI tried out this build recently in pve.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8va1DfhtAaM\n\nBut I've had more success with a ruler's sword or even a dark espada ropera in pvp to be honest. This build consumes too much stamina and is slow. I tried using dark chaos blade but it hasn't long reach and it doesn't seem to stagger people like the ruler's sword.\n\nI don't think powerstanced ice rapiers are the way either. Surely, there must be an op build for a SL838 that can't be defeated, ever. An invincible SL838 quality build. Anyone knows? Asking for a friend."

The creepy stares and the bodies of the dead corpses. After around chapter 15 I couldn\u2019t read anymore, I skipped to the final chapters for the sake of my sanity. The falling into ashes scene probably disturbed me the most. I honestly don\u2019t know why. He was rolling and probably inhaling and consuming the bones of somebody he loved. The fact he died was such a surprise because I felt like he was still alive. I wanted Bum to get out of there, I wanted Sangwoo to carry on being kind or to just get thrown in prison. I mostly wanted to change them. Change Bum from being obsessive and perverted and well...creepy...and change Sangwoo from being manipulative rough and mean spirited. They kinda deserved what happened to them at the end, regardless of how they grew up. I didn\u2019t ship them at all, I read this on impulse because I was bored, I\u2019ve never read anything like it. I don\u2019t read explicit manga and I\u2019m not a avid thriller reader, I\u2019m going to have to bleach my eyes out with Ouran High School Host Club after this. Curiosity killed the cat."

Since then, my depression has been a lot worse, I (19F) was admitted to a hospital for a suicide attempt a few months later (it wasn't entirely because of being cheated on, but it played a big part). I also fell into self-harm shortly after, it's something I still struggle with to this day, and I haven't been able to forgive myself for what happened. I was betrayed and left behind by two people I cared about so much.\n\nFast forward a year and a half, my now ex-best friend messaged me for the first time in months. She vented to me about how she and my ex-boyfriend broke up. She opened up to me about how he was abusive towards her and she was looking for support. She apologized for cutting me off after she started dating him and wants to see me again.\n\nI told her that I'm sorry about what happened to her and I forgave her too. But it's been a few months since she's apologized and now I'm rethinking what I said to her. The two of them caused me so much pain and distress and I'm not sure if I want to forgive her. This is gonna sound horrible, but I'm not sure if I feel bad for her either...I'm really lost and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel. Should I talk to her again? How Should I feel about her situation? How should I feel in general?\n\nTLDR: My ex-bf cheated on me with my ex-best friend and now that they've broken up, my best friend is apologizing and asking for support."

                "body": "I want everyone here to know before you read that everyone in the story is ok. If it was not for my mother who was the steadfast bulwark against the storm, this would have ended badly. \n\nMother, stepdad, and myself were all sitting in the living room talking. We were discussing the Capital Hill incident. I am an independent. I piss off people on both sides of the fence for some reason. In this case, I was discussing what we know about those that have been arrested. How we know this was a planned incident and the planning either took place on Parler or by other means. I don\u2019t need to go into details because we all know the world views that are portrayed from these different groups. \n\nI am intentionally keeping my voice as neutral as possible. Describing what we know so far, and what is being said on the Q side as well. I was basically arguing both sides to show how predictable it all is coming from a Qonsumer? (Take on consumer?) \n\nAnd I am intentionally being skeptical. Saying innocent until proven guilty. Let\u2019s think about things rationally. How does history play into this. How social media algorithms create echo chambers and encourages this blind tribalistic chaos. \n\nStep dad apparently had enough and told me to take my Antifa crap back to CA. At which point I was taken aback because I was not saying anything that could at all be portrayed as Antifa. \n\nAfter 6 months living at home (converted to remote with my CA job, so moved back east and have been saving money) I finally reached my limit. \n\nI basically told him to stop being a blind ignorant Q supporter who comes up with excuses for any actions taken by those on the extreme right. Of course I used some very flavorful language. That made him mad and he stood up telling me to get the crap (again colorful language everywhere) out of his house. \n\nTold him that I would love to see his jobless (quit job way before Covid and has been on the whole XRP will go up. The financial reset is here. It\u2019s just x time away. Time arrives and it\u2019s x time away again) you know what get up and make me. \n\nSo he stood up and went to get a drink. While pouring his drink about 12 feet away from me he said something that struck a nerve in me. I forget exactly what was said, but I\u2019ve never felt rage and adrenaline like that before. So I quickly got out of my chair and raised my fist to act like I would punch him. Now I\u2019m 12+ ft away. Nowhere near close enough to even land a hit. And I\u2019ve never gotten to this point ever in my 24 years of life. \n\nWell he then got into my face and was begging me to punch him. I calmly (somehow) told him that I would never throw the first punch and give him the satisfaction. \n\nMore words were said. He said something along the lines of \u201cI call you my son when I tell people about your success\u201d \u201cI am proud to call you that, and you act like this?\u201d (Yes I am definitely at fault for escalating the situation. That I understand. And now that it\u2019s over he and I both share the blame evenly) \n\nWell I told him that the only father I have ever had committed suicide when I was 9. He would never achieve the title of father in my life. He would never be as great of a man as my dad was. \n\nI forget all that was said and happened after that. But the next thing I knew, he was going for the gun and telling me to get the F out. At this stage I\u2019m thinking \u201cwell crap, I\u2019ve got a crazy cultist on my hands and there is about to be domestic violence like I\u2019ve never seen. \n\nMother told me to go to my room, and I\u2019m ashamed to say my first thought was \u201cI have to get to my gun and shoot him before he has a chance to shoot me. \n\nHe knew that\u2019s what I was thinking and immediately said as I was going to my room \u201che is going to get his gun, get out of the way\u201d to my mom. \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot him before he can shoot me\u201d he told her.  She was screaming \u201cstop, just please stop\u201d while holding tightly onto him. \n\nShe trusted I would not do such a thing. I was consumed by the idea in the moment. And as I went to my room, and I looked at the gun (historical bolt action Mosin Nagant from WWII) I thought \u201cthis isn\u2019t right, this is evil\u201d. If he kills me, he kills me I thought. At least then I will know peace, and will have full confirmation if there is an afterlife in any way. \n\nSo I came around the corner with my hands behind my back leaning against the wall. Then pulling my hands to my side to show I had nothing. To my stepdads credit, the gun was pointed at the ground. And come to find out later, the reason he went for it is because he saw a look in my eye that scared the crap out of him. I know exactly what was in that look. I saw the pure terror in his eyes when my gaze pierced his soul. And at that moment I even feared what I was truly capable of. I felt his terror within myself. Pure terror at my own capacity to do horrific things. \n\nHe started packing and was going to leave. Told me to be gone by morning. Insert more words and drama. Me offering to have a heart to heart so we could get to the real issues. Him refusing to have a \u201cfluffy\u201d and civilized conversation with me. (This is maybe 5 min after the gun stuff above) \n\nHe and mom went downstairs and I went into the living room. And decided to focus on my own spiritual and subjective experience. Insert prayer, visualizations, chakras and commanding the evil to leave this place in the love and light of the infinite creator etc. \n\nAfter maybe 5 min of meditated prayer yelling from downstairs suddenly stopped. At the same time so did the spiritual sensations I was having. \n(Yes I believe in subjective phenomena. I am still skeptical as to whether or not what I was doing actually helped the situation. I was praying for the forces of good to take control of the situation. Are these beliefs and methods I use psychological and emotional coping mechanisms? Could be. I\u2019m still a skeptic.  But they helped me and that is the most important thing about belief. If it helps you, and brings good into the world then it\u2019s worth the belief IMHO) \n\n\nThen we had the long civilized conversation that I wanted. We found common ground. I told him that I was sorry for using my dead dad against him. It was the sharpest and deepest emotional cut that I knew would work. And that it was dishonorable of me to use that. I then told him I was not ready to yet, but one of these days I would be honored to call him Dad. I then gave him a hug as he started to tear up. \n\nWhile the greater good came out on top in my situation, I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how things go down in more dysfunctional situations. \n\nAnd we have both agreed to not discuss anything about politics with each other. We both know where the lines are drawn. I know when it is time for me to personally walk away so I can calm down. \n\nAnd while the events that unfolded for me may seem extreme in the moment, it pales in comparison to all of the destroyed relationships so many of you have dealt with. \n\nI wish you all the best that I possibly can. We will all get through this. We have to remain optimistic and hopeful. We have to take responsibility for ourselves. We have to know when to walk away. And we have to try our best to be better than we were just a moment ago.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nNever in my life has a loved one or myself even considered using a gun on anyone outside of a home invader or someone intentionally trying to cause serious harm. \n\nThe thought of using a firearm to shoot someone has never even entered my mind as an optional path to take. The thought of extinguishing the experience of life from anyone disgusts me. I literally broke down into tears after realizing what I was thinking. And from my step dad\u2019s perspective, it was the only way he would be able to defend his 5ft 6in barely 170lb self against my 6ft 4in 280lb self. The look in my eyes scared him, and he had no way of knowing that I would not try to fight him. Granted being over 12ft away and taking a fake air punch so seriously is a major failure in judgment on his part. And a major breakdown of composure on my own part. \n\nI also know death as I lost my biological father to suicide when I was 9. (I understand the after effects intimately) And I promised I would never take or seriously harm another life unless my life or someone else was in serious jeopardy."

This isn\u2019t so bad early on, but will absolutely prevent you from being able to clear the later raids.\n\nIn one Abyssal dungeon I did last night, we wiped 7 times on the 2nd one because the gunslinger & wardancer did not have battle potions & kept dying. (Despite my best efforts on my Paladin alt lol) The excuse? \u201cThis is my alt bro\u201d. \n\n(I guess the guy was just relying on founder\u2019s pack potion chests for his main. It\u2019s possible other players are as well.)\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know, you can only use \u201c% healing\u201d potions in Guardian Raids & Abyssal Dungeons. Save what you find or craft it with materials you gain from foraging. This way you will have healing no matter what character you\u2019re on. You can even craft the 60% healing purple ones.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a raid, do NOT spawn with a feather. Go back to the start & run back. It will refresh your potions.\n\nLastly, I rarely see people use their Awakening skill or their lvl 50 skill. I wonder if this is because they didn\u2019t complete the quest to get it or they don\u2019t know how or where to buy Chaos Stones so they can use it.\n\nNew players need to get in the habit of using it because it\u2019s a huge chunk of your damage or can be a game changing save for the party. It will also fill up your identity gauge. It is NOT an optional skill.\n\n\nTL; DR \n\nForage plants so you can craft healing potions for raids in your stronghold. \n\nComplete your awakening quest & use the skill often.

I think the key to enjoying this game is playing it in small doses, though.\u201d\n\nHuh? Is that what we\u2019re here for as gamers?\n\nYou don\u2019t pick up an MMO (or most other games for that matter) to NOT play it (and it has nothing to do with addiction or no-life\u2019ing so don\u2019t start on that either).\n\nI don\u2019t load up Civ V to play it for 15 mins & log off. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s designed for. I have about 2k hrs in ESO over the course of a couple years. I didn\u2019t load up ESO to turn in a couple crafts & log out. No, I actually completed entire storylines & content *that I paid to exist*. Same with FFXIV.\n\nThat\u2019s what mobile games are for: Minimum, low investment game time. Last time I checked, New World isn\u2019t one.\n\nI want New World to realize it\u2019s potential but let\u2019s agree on some basics it needs to hit.\n\nMMOs have even less leeway than standard games in this regard because it requires far more long term time investment. If your MMO sucks, it\u2019s going to show. If people are playing your game less, it\u2019s means they\u2019re playing someone else\u2019s more. Not happily twiddling their thumbs for you to get it together.\n\nPeople play MMOs to dump tons of hours into them. It\u2019s always been that way because they\u2019re the quintessential long haul genre of games.\n\nTelling people to not play New World to enjoy it is a ridiculous defense because if enough people do that, you no longer have an MMO. It dominoes! Servers start emptying, trade starts drying up, can\u2019t complete main story content because oops you\u2019re required to complete a dungeon that no one is getting on for.\n\nWhat will you be leveling crafting for? Yourself? Most of the time, people aren\u2019t even actually playing the game with it. They\u2019re watching a movie on Netflix while doing it. How\u2019s that for engagement?\n\nFact is, if you find yourself typing that I should play less with a straight face, you\u2019re probably aware that you\u2019d feel the same if you played any more than you currently do.\n\nWhy is that a problem though? There\u2019s no shame in acknowledging a game is undercooked & it can be done without a hint of toxicity.\n\nProbably a very unpopular view, but I believe Amazon did this backwards. They should\u2019ve released Lost Ark first (which is an actual complete game) & let that hold people over while they went back to the drawing board for New World with the Beta feedback. Blowback be damned.\n\nI mean, something basic breaks in every single patch lol. That\u2019s not acceptable for a game already struggling to hold player faith.\n\nThey can\u2019t really afford to screw up at this part of the year because so many other games are going to have big releases shortly. \n\nOnce they lose the players, they aren\u2019t getting them back. All people will remember is a shit taste in their mouth.\n\nTL;DR summary\n\nTelling people to play an MMO less (or play something else this isn\u2019t your game waaaah) is not a defense of the game. It actually points to glaring issues you\u2019re low key aware of but decline to acknowledge. Or, you\u2019ve barely experienced it while still being lvl 18.\n\nIt\u2019s also ridiculous to assert this is most people\u2019s first MMO. No, most are annoyed BECAUSE we have played several & don\u2019t have this experience. And, sadly, I don\u2019t see Amazon pulling a FFXIV & rebuilding the game."

I realized I had forgotten to finish up the lvl 30 quests so I went back & did them all.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve been unable to advance or find the quest that I need to do for it. I did some searching online & it just sounds like it\u2019s supposed to appear above your head.\n\nAre there any Pathfinder specific quests after \u201cBeginning Again\u201d that I might be missing?"

I'm in dire need of an upgrade as I can barely play most current games. However, I've never built a PC before so a lot of it is making my head spin.\n\nI'm looking to go for a serious gaming PC that can play most things on Ultra at 1440p 144-165hz. I put a build together, but I'm pretty sure I'm probably doing it wrong. A previous build I had was well over 3k but I'd like to stay decently below it if possible.\n\nHere's what I've got: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Cfb2Ps\n\nI went for Noctuas as I've heard they're great for cooling (I was also going to replace the h100i v2's fans with two of them). Originally, I wanted to run a build with Corsair HD's but ran into issues deciding on a decent case for them. I do also make sure to check the QVL's for the motherboards. So far, I've been leaning towards ASRock, but if you have alternatives I don't mind that as well. I'm open to Ultrawide 1440p 144hz but I just went with the S2417DG due to its decent pricing.\n\nIf you can provide any assistance it is greatly appreciated!"

I'm not purchasing anytime soon, however. I just want to create the framework to work towards.\n\nIs there a better build I could be using overall? Also, would it be better to just go for the GTX 1080 for the GPU?\n\nIf anyone could offer me some assistance, I'd greatly appreciate it!"

I do not drink, smoke or use drugs.\n\n\nI've had 2 episodes of loss of consciousness.\n\n\nFirst one (March): I was sitting in front of my computer, in a Discord call. I suddenly woke up in my bed (I had been in an odd state of unconsciousness that I was trying to wake up from). My head was bleeding. I checked the chat and it was about an hour since I was last conscious.\n\nSecond one (June): I was sitting in front of my computer, in a Zoom call with a friend. I was doing something very stressful. I remember my hand was shaking. When I finished my task, suddenly I lost consciousness again and fell on top of the radiator by my side. My mother heard the fall and came upstairs. She said I was on the floor and *my eyes were open*. I was speaking to her in English (not our native language) because I thought she was my friend and I was still in the call. Even as I went downstairs and she told me to sit on her bed, I thought it was my male friend asking that. It took me about 30 minutes to realize I was in my house with my mother, and not in a call with my friend.\n\nIn both cases I hadn't eaten/drank water in approx 8 hours.\n\n\nCurrent medications: Fluoxetine (Prozac) and Clonazepam (Klonopin). I was not taking these at the time of the second episode.\n\n\nI saw my doctor and she ordered 1. a blood test and 2. a neurologist appointment, but she doesn't know what happened, and neither do I.\n\n\nShe said it couldn't have been a syncope because they can tell they are about to faint, and for me it was conscious to unconscious in a millisecond. What are your opinions?\n\n\nMost important details: not eating or drinking water for hours, sitting down at the computer, sudden drop to the ground, eyes remaining open, hallucinating/dream-like state for a long period of time."

                "body": "Let me preface this by saying I'm not American and English is not my native language so apologies for any grammatical errors.\n\nThis is my path:\n\nI graduated highschool in 2015. The Physics institute that I wanted to study in required 2 years of previous university. I did those 2 years (2016-2017) and I got stuck on one subject for an entire year. That year (2018) I studied a bit of programming.\n\nIn 2019, a Physics degree opened up in my city and I switched from getting into the institute to this degree.\n\n2020 rolls around, I move out (rent is payed with my mom's money). Pandemic hits. Online classes. That year I got almost nothing done. I partially passed a couple of subjects and that's it.\n\nIn 2021 I decided this career was too difficult, too long, I hated the people and the environment, and I live in a perpetually economically unstable country + the aftereffects of the pandemic; I wanted to start making money soon and not 4 years from now. I dropped out.\n\nI enrolled in a programming course that took me twice as long as I thought to finish. I have depression and anxiety and I'm a serious procrastinator and that's basically the main reason.\n\nIn 2022 I finished this course and my sister hooked me up on a program that teaches programmers hard and soft skills (working with people, 7 days a week 9-5 job simulator, etc.). It costs money, but it helps with the initial jump of my career.\n\n(TL;DR 23yo University dropout who did some programming courses and is trying to get into an intense program).\n\nMe now:\n\nI'm trying to get into this program now and I'm absolutely terrified. There's 3 main reasons:\n\n1) I've never done anything consistently for 10 months in my life (except waking up to go to school every morning). I have no routine at all. I absolutely do not trust myself to be able to hold a consistent schedule for 10 months, every single business day, 8 hours a day. Getting projects done on time, meeting deadlines. I have to navigate an environment that I've never been in before and it terrifies me that I'll have a breakdown at some point and get kicked out of the program because I missed a deadline or I didn't go in one day.\n\n\n\n2) I have to interact with people and show myself and I'm terrible at that too. I have social anxiety and I'm scared I'll say or do the wrong thing, come off the wrong way, be dislikeable, etc. I feel like I'll have to put on this professional mask for half of my waking life and I don't know if I'll be able to handle that. My real goofy non-serious non-professional self will show sooner or later (this could also be cultural since the program is international and I come from a place where even in formal situations people are very informal).\n\n3) This is what jobs are. This is the beginning of the rest of my life. And if I can't do it, then what the hell do I do? I can't just not work. I feel childish because I'm supposed to be an adult, but I don't act like one. I don't trust myself to navigate this world as an adult. I am terrified.\n\nAlso I used to do therapy and it helped me tremendously, but I can't afford it anymore.\n\nTL;DR: Almost 24. No work experience, mental health issues and lack of self-discipline and routine make me feel scared, vulnerable and incapable of being a real adult and navigating the world.\n\n\ud83e\udd74"

Symptoms started around the 4th and have been managed with OTC cold/flu meds, as well as some Benzonatate capsules and a rescue inhaler.\n\nThe URI exacerbated some cardiac issues, which I am waiting to see a cardiologist for. I have had high blood pressure and sinus tachycardia since I have been ill. I was also having chest pain and shortness of breath earlier. I had 2 abnormal EKGs and 1 borderline EKG over about the last week, but was released with no care because the bloodwork was okay (though I have high WBCs, neutrophils, and monocytes).\n\nPreexisting spinal conditions are:\n\nprominent spina bifida occulta, (dextro)scoliosis, spondylolisthesis/anterolisthesis, bilateral foraminal stenosis, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, lumbar transitional vertebra, bilateral facet arthrosis, endplate sclerosis, sacralization of right transverse process, bilateral spondylolysis\n\nPain onset:\n\nEnd of day 4, after I started going into coughing and choking fits. Had developed slight neck pain and stiffness on day 2, but it went away.\n\nPain from cough or sneeze:\n\nsevere pain radiates from chest and mid-thoracic, pain travels bilaterally into shoulder blades and clavicle then to right cervical spine, pain travels down to lumbar spine and through hips down through thighs, pain radiates from shoulders to elbows and then tapers off in forearm and hands becoming a dull lingering ache.\n\nPain type:\n\nI can't really describe it any way except that it feels like my spine is on fire. It's a similar pain to when you step down or land wrong and all the nerves in your legs fire off. I know a slipped disc can cause some radiating pain, but it is also in my neck, which is unusual. Note, up until now, I have only ever had issues with lumbar and sacral spine."

Upon seeing that, Amy would start crying and shouting, 'I wanna come back!' while her tears would be Zoidberg in liquid form. He would then try to calm her down, which of course would only freak her out even more. Professor Farnsworth's voice would then shout out, 'Shut up, you imbeciles!' Everyone would wonder where his voice was coming from, and he would explain that it seemed he had been turned into air pressure inside of the spaceship. He would then add something along the lines of, 'Everything you say and do is hurting me right now, so essentially, just like back on Earth, your existence is causing me pain.'",

Insane power with choice band otherwise, role compression plus surprise factor were the main selling points here. i find it somewhat hard to switch in and have had a bit of trouble balancing the bulk for that and the speed to get off tricks.\n\nScizor--\n\nPretty standard defogger, plus life orb max attack bullet punch does kinda obscene damage. Counter cause i see a lot of people try to hit scizor with things like earthquake when they're in on it for chip due to its lack of weaknesses, rare usage but can definitely also catch people a bit off guard. used to be band, but found locking into counter on a setup sweeper to be too much of a death sentence as well as locking into defog.\n\nR Wash--\n\nStandard bulky pivot rotom wash, physdef to switch into infernape mainly, found thunder wave to be useful for my team being slower and also most people expect wisp on rotom. \n\nEntei--\n\nBegan as band but changed to scarf to add more speed to the team, sacred fire is a move i really like generally, surprisingly bulky too. That being said, does end up underused often\n\nGliscor--\n\nAnother complex setup mon, i feel like breloom gives me the liberty to go more offensive with this one, fling is cool to poison things that don't expect it, and acrobatics is really nice as a strong flying move on gliscor to hit would be flying/levitating checks (though still not worth much on rotom wash) \n\nmain struggle is passive damage and defensive synergy, i often end up taking too much chip damage and then just ran over by something fast. maybe my playstyle is just too defensive generally, but is there anything from this that i could improve. open to replacing crawdaunt or entei as well",

Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am 15 and male even though I'm not exactly sure about that as I get older I've kinda started to question the gender binary. I often describe myself as a walking contradiction in that I can have a lot of energy and generally make good impressions on strangers but also have crippling social anxiety because of overthinking and am really awkward in interactions with people that I won't never see again, and even though I love being seen as an individual and the concept of individuality i also have a fear of rejection and a desire to fit in in some ways to give only a few examples.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nI have moderate ADHD, but that's all I've been diagnosed with. \n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nMy upbringing has been pretty free. I have had free reign of the internet since I can remember for better or for worse, and my parents are I'd say slightly less strict than average. I've been lucky enough to generally not have any religion forced on me, and would call myself an atheist, though I would probably join the satanic temple if that counts. I was a \"gifted child\" in elementary school and my parents very much nurtured this, and my teachers also did, which made my earlier years pretty positive, as it gave me kind of a feeling of being special. Currently I get into the occasional lowkey philosophical conversation with my dad, and am monitored pretty minimally unless I have a ton of missing work. I very much like not having had a super structured environment and have been thankful for it.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?  \nI want to be a psychology major, because I think it would be very interesting to learn more about how people work and understand them better, and also to be able to diagnose myself accurately. But primarily I don't want a big office job, and the human mind seems so interesting and hearing others' experiences to expand my perspective and to help people sounds nice so it seems like a pretty perfect job for me, or also going into psychological research is also very appealing to me. \n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI would probably feel really relaxed and liberated. I love the silence of late night and having that all day would be great. I love being home alone. I'd spend some time just thinking about whats going on in my life and what I can do in the future, maybe blast some music and sing along to it, and talk to myself really loudly. Overall yes please sign me up.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI like acting because it's interesting to try to figure out what a character would say and be thinking in a scene and i don't really get stage fright despite my terrible social anxiety surprisingly probably because I started acting at a young age before the overthinking got too bad. I feel guilty whenever it makes me feel like a show off though. I also really enjoy going on long hikes, and again listening to music or just thinking. I guess depends, I like outdoor activities if they're pretty lowkey, but absolutely hate all sports. My sport of choice is track/cross country because it doesnt require hand eye coordination and I'm actually decently good at it. Indoor activities are nice too though, i enjoy relaxing inside for sure. Additionally, at night I often will write big paragraphs about whatever idea pops into my head and post them to my \"spam\" instagram account with 13 followers.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI'd say I'm very curious, but I'm bad at pursuing my curiosity. I am always thinking of new things that may be interesting to research, but only end up looking up a quarter of them. I have kind of phases in interests. My most recent one has been myers briggs, hence this post because of my obsession with correctly typing myself over the past few months. I also enjoy looking up philosophical questions, like reading articles on r/philosophy, and I really like this one guy billbeteet on tiktok and thinking about them. So I'd say conceptual even though a lot of my ideas are also more grounded like how bread companies should sell the end pieces separately at a lower cost.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI would want to take a leadership position more preventatively than to get a feeling of power. I would be pretty lax, but I also want my ideas to be heard because often times my brain gets into this mode of wanting things to go my way. So again, preventatively so I could make sure my ideas got heard, and so that things would go \"right.\" I am very open to other ideas, and if someone else's idea is better I am not afraid to admit it and go with that.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI am not coordinated at all, I mean I have decent handwriting because in 4th grade one day I was like \"hey I should have good handwriting\" I can't catch a ball to save my life though, and have slow reaction times, so I suck at sports as I already said. I often bump into things as well.\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI am casually artistic I guess, I used to be more so in middle and elementary school. I was obsessed with all things anime in 6th grade, so that gave me a decent base, and now when I do draw I'd say I'm above average though not by a lot. I'm not the most creative artistically however, and when I do have ideas my brain sometimes will come up with reasons why its not a good idea or it's too much of a cliche or something like that, so I guess that's part of why I don't draw too much because I don't have enough good ideas. I am decent in performing arts as I said earlier, but again, I'd say just slightly above average for my age. I generally tend to lose interest in a form of art when it becomes more work and less of just a creative fun outlet if I am not extremely interested in it. I dropped out of band because I did not want to bother with the more complicated musical theory because I did not want to pursue a career in music, so I didn't want it to be so serious. I like indie and r&b music generally.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI am sometimes embarrassed by how much time I spend dwelling on stupid socially awkward shit I have done in the past. On one hand I want to say it's in the past, but sometimes it is kind of interesting to me to consider what I could have done to change a situation or a comeback to save myself from embarrassment (and they're really good too, just a few days/weeks/moths/years late) In the present I spend most of my time observing others, and occasionally coming up with scenarios for strangers' lives, or just observing people at school in general. I'm not at all a thrill seeker, even though when I can work up the courage for a roller coaster I like them. I also spend a lot of time thinking about self improvement, even though i rarely implement them lol. But I also plan for the future to an extent, even though I never like to narrow down my options in planning.  I have had no idea what I wanted my future to look like until this year.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIt really depends. Of course if it benefits me, then yeah. Or if its inconsequential enough for me yeah I'll do it. But I don't usually go out of my way for others. If they have good reasoning just in general or need the help enough I'll also do it.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nAbsolutely. I can't stand arguments that contradict themselves, and I beat myself up for my own hypocrisy very often. I need reasons behind actions, even though sometimes I have trouble putting my own into words. I try to avoid acting on impulse but also often overthink actions so much that the only way to get myself to make a decision is to just impulsively go for it. Rejection therapy haha.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nhaha funny question, I need efficiency in everything. I hate extra steps or having to do more than is needed a lot unless I am interested in a topic in which case I will learn everything I can. But generally I do stuff as quickly as decently possible. However, I am terrible at getting myself to do any sort of schoolwork that I am not interested in because of this, so I am not productive unless I like the assignment. So yeah I love efficient and to the point stuff, but am not very productive in most cases, so I can't really judge others for not being productive if not.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI wouldn't call myself manipulative and if I do feel controlling I feel incredibly guilty most of the time. However, sometimes I get into a weird state of wanting someone else to do one thing in place of another and pressuring them to do that if I think its better especially if I care about them, but I wouldn't say I'm controlling.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI doodle casually occasionally, I like writing long paragraphs about stuff in my notes app when inspiration hits, I also like going on walks and thinking about stuff. Again acting is cool sometimes even though I'm bad at the social aspect of it. I also sing pretty casually, in my school jazz band last year, and chorus this year. I love thinking about stuff because I guess it kind of connects me to my elementary school years, and kinda gives me self validation that I am smart because getting so much in elementary school and now so little validation of that topic has caused me to doubt myself a lot but also thinking about stuff just is cool to see new perspectives on stuff and sometimes come up with bizarre stuff just for fun. I also have been just kinda naturally talented in performing arts in that I have a \"naturally good\" singing voice so i'm not too embarrassed about that so its more fun, and i get some compliments occasionally about it which is cool. Kinda same with acting in that I understood that you have to really get into a character's head from a young age, and I often will have specific ways that I see specific scenes and lines playing out just by looking at a script so thats kind of fun to play out, and pretty no stress as well. \n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nMy favorite classes are english and history because I love analyzing texts and possible motives and connections behind stuff and my english teacher says that I make a lot of conceptual connections very quickly. So logic and creativity are my favorite things to use in learning. I like when I have somehting that I can think about thoroughly that is open for interpretation, where subjects like math and science where there is generally going to be only one answer are less interesting to me, and I don't have the motive to build up the base in those topics to get to the actual interesting stuff. I hate rigid learning environments that won't let me do things my own way, especially because I typically think my way is better. I also suck at turning stuff in on time, I am much more \"quality over quantity.\"\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI always wing it. Making a plan takes so much time and I typically don't even follow plans anyway, so I don't see much reason to do one for me. I can make pretty good decisions if presented with a new problem in a project, but I don't strategize too much in the long term because life is too unpredictable for that and I often end up not liking a project initially and changing it.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI don't want to really accomplish too much. I don't want to be rich or own a company or anything, or have kids. I want a quiet life in a small remotely located house in europe where I live with a significant other and spend most of my time researching stuff and talking to my s/o and going on walks and stuff. I want to work in psychology, and live fairly comfortably, but have also been fortunate enough to have been told i will be set for life money wise so I am not very ambitious career wise. Just a steady casual job in psychology that interests me and I can learn from is good for me. I guess some would be pretty furious at my ideal life and lack of real motivation to contribute to society, but I don't really see myself getting to be a ceo by working, nor do I have the drive to do so most likely, so might as well spend my time on something that interests me, and live a relaxed life.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI am deathly afraid of heights, I can't even go near any large fall. I am extremely cautious in general. I am made uncomfortable in situations where I can't think of anything to say or things are completely out of my control. I am also made uncomfortable by people who make stupid remarks to try to get to you that are too dumb to reason with because in their heads they would have \"won\" and thought they got to me, and if I try to reason with them they just take that as me being \"triggered\" oddly specific but those people I hate so much. I hate when people just won't listen to logic at all in that neighborhood too, or when they can't give me a good reason why I should do something. I also hate some parts of social interactions that I just suck at like I can't make eye contact because I assume that the other person assumes it means something, and I don't know where the fuck to look when someone is talking to me or let alone passing me on the street like i dont want to look at them but just looking straight ahead is so weird and suspicious. I just generally assume people notice my small motions more than they do in social interactions which makes me hyperaware of everything I am doing and just makes it really unpleasant especially if I don't know someone. There is also nothing I hate more than someone who dances around stuff to try to preserve my feelings and I wish people were brutally honest with one another all the time because I think it would make so many interactions feel so much more genuine.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nThe highs of my life all relate to a complete lack of stress, or having some sort of mental breakthrough for myself that gives me a new perspective on something, which often relieves stress, so yeah, stress. I love casual situations where I can just talk about whatever with my few close friends, or when I am just sitting peacefully on a hill listening to music and thinking without anything bugging me saying I have to get out of there to work on something. Just being able to think without worrying about anything is amazing.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nContrasting the highs, stressful, when I've dug myself into a difficult hole to get out of, when I have to take life more seriously than I usually do. When I didn't do homework for a month and had a pile of 30+ missing assignments, when I did something shitty and had to face reality and own up to it when I am so unused to taking anything so seriously and also was embarrassed about it. I hate when things get too serious or real.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nNot very, I am often observing my surroundings when out in public walking or something, but I often will daydream to an extent as well while walking. In school I often can zone out thinking about something and miss a lot about a class. I also get distracted very easily when trying to focus on stuff and my mind drifts to something more interesting always when I find something to be boring. However, sometimes in new social situations i get really nervous and almost paranoid in which case I am very aware and awkward about what I do and as I said before, hyperaware of my movements.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI would probably first think through the events that led me to that. And I guess then the future, or if I would want to get out or not. Eventually I'd probably get to existential stuff and maybe start thinking about things that could have changed the earth's track completely, and maybe then start wondering about aliens, or just what else could be in the universe.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI take forever to make pretty much any decision, I am incredibly indecisive. I will take minutes to order at a restaurant, and constantly am creating every possible situation that could come out of something, and have to think through all of that before confidently making a decision. As I said earlier, I'm at the point where I kind of just decide to do stuff because thinking it through takes too long. And yes if I get new information I will go through the whole process of weighing the pros and cons again.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI don't think about my emotions much. I'd say I'm pretty progressive politically, and I generally either assume the best or worst in people, no in between, but my moral compass is open to new information I guess, and I don't really think of emotions first in too many situations, even though I do like the feeling of helping others.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nOnly if I need someone to like me for some reason, otherwise I state my mind and absolutely DESPISE sugar coating. I do occasionally feel pressure to fit in however, for example I started wearing more trendy clothes this year because I needed new clothes so I just decided to buy trendy stuff because it would improve my image i guess and i needed new stuff anyways. I have a constant battle in my head with loving being an individual and wanting to know what it feels like to fit in perfectly.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI break rules that I don't think should exist, and think that abusive authority should be challenged, or even just overly assertive authority should be. I do have a certain respect for authority that genuinely respects those that they are above, and recognise them as human beings as well. I think that anything that is wrong or hurts the innocent or just overuses power for no reason should be challenged. When I break rules I do it less as a statement, but more just because I consider the rule to be stupid and unnecessary, or overcontrolling.\n\nOk so I just spent  like an hour on this lol hopefully I can get some responses from this."

In terms of dysphoria, most times I dislike my body and would like to be more masculine, and I get uncomfortable when people use femenine pronouns. I also get happy when I pass as male.\n\nBut recently I watched a show and I identified with the main character a lot and basically stole her personality. And she's a girl, so that means I want to be a girl too. Yeah, that's how volatile my identity is.\n\nAnother thing is I don't know if I really want to be percieved as a man as others. I think I would rather be with a man in a straight way or with a girl in a lesbian way. Also, I'm going to start university, and I want to give the impression of being smart. And I think I'd prefer people to see me as a smart girl rather than a smart boy. It feels cooler.\n\nSo I don't know. I'm afraid I will end up regretting it. Maybe I can just be a masculine girl with a neutral name. But I was so sure of wanting to change my body, fuck."

                "body": "For what feels like the first time in my life, I'm allowing myself to feel disappointed. \nI'd always been holding on to hope. I have a very vivid imagination and have been escaping into my inner world, my hopes and dreams, as a coping mechanism. \nI have also attached myself to people (recently especially one person) who I admire, and projected my hopes and dreams onto them. I made them a part of my inner safe place, idealising them as this near perfect human being who knows a solution for everything. \n\nBut recently I got to discover my fear of disappointment and abandonment and I realised that this fear keeps the disconnection from myself intact. \n\nI think realising this has caused the emotional turmoil that I'm now experiencing. At first, I felt lots of pain from all the abandonment I faced throughout my life. I cried and cried for hours, and it felt so good to finally release all that pain. \nThen, a few days later, I started feeling lots of anxiety about losing people, being let down again. The anxiety made me think that I couldn't trust people, even those who are close to me, that they would all eventually leave and forget about me. It was bad. I was a wreck until I managed to talk about it and was comforted by the person who I've been projecting all my desire for attachment onto. At first, I felt relieved, but then I kept having dreams of that same person rejecting me, ignoring me, not wanting to have anything to do with me. \nThe dreams felt so real, the emotions they evoked stayed with me throughout the day. After three or four days of this, I just accepted how real it felt and took it as part of the process. \nThen, something surprising happened: I got very angry. I've been angry at that person for three more days, ranting about them in my head, at times feeling full of contempt for them, questioning things about them that I never dared question before (for fear of being illoyal and losing them). \n\nNow it seems like anger and contempt are giving way to a feeling I'm not very familiar with: the feeling of utter disappointment with people and the world at large. I feel like whatever they do, whatever I do, it will always just be mediocre. \nLike, \"what's the point in trying if even the person who I put on a pedestal and admired so much doesn't really care about me? How can I trust that there are people who do care? Can I even trust myself not to let other people down?\" \nAlso, there seems to be no good reason to believe that I will achieve anything in my life. I want to help people but I can't even get my own shit together. When exactly should all the things I want to do with my life happen if I don't do anything to make them happen? \nBut what's the point. Every rewarding feeling I could get from achieving anything will vanish quickly. So why even set goals? When I achieve them, I will feel the rush of dopamine or whatever, and then it will be over and I will look for the next thing to work towards. It's like being a drug addict, always chasing that high but it will never last. \n\nAnd by idolizing people, I've given myself a substitute drug. If I didn't feel that connection and attention from people in real life, I could turn to my inner world and fabricate some. I imagined that there was someone who cared about me, to whom I was important.\nBut that kept me addicted to this idealized version of them. I couldn't afford to see them for who they really are as a human being with flaws because they were my inner support system, albeit largely in my imagination. \n\nNow I can see clearly that I'm not as important to them as they are to me. They appreciate my as a friend, they enjoy talking to me, but they are perfectly happy when we are not talking for a few weeks. They don't need me in their life as much as I need them.\n\nI'm still a bit afraid of that nihilistic feeling. But it also feels good to finally get rid of these idealistic fantasies and seeing reality a bit clearer. \n\nThanks for reading all this. Any thoughts or experiences with disappointment and nihilism are appreciated as I'm still learning to process them."

Der ganze Umzug dauerte gestern 16 Stunden inklusive Fahrzeiten, plus heute nochmal 7 Stunden Herumr\u00e4umen, wie sie mir gerade erz\u00e4hlt hat. Au\u00dfer mir hatte sie noch drei weitere Helfer. Es h\u00e4tte einfach nicht sein m\u00fcssen. Der Umzug war \u00fcberhaupt nicht geplant und v\u00f6llig ineffizient organisiert. Obwohl sie ein 20qm-Zimmer voller Zeug hatte, dachte sie, dass sie nur 5 Kartons brauchen w\u00fcrde. Sie hat Dyskalkulie und kann Gr\u00f6\u00dfen und Mengen sehr schlecht einsch\u00e4tzen, hat aber auch die Warnungen, Ratschl\u00e4ge und Nachfragen mehrerer Menschen (inklusive mir) in den Wind geschlagen.   \nIch hatte auch nicht den perfekten \u00dcberblick \u00fcber ihre Sachen und die Menge der verf\u00fcgbaren Kartons, sonst h\u00e4tte ich vehementer darauf bestanden, noch Umzugskartons nachzubestellen. \n\nSo lief es darauf hinaus, dass f\u00fcnf Menschen unz\u00e4hlige Male treppauf und treppab rennen mussten, um einzelne Dekogegenst\u00e4nde, lose B\u00fccherstapel, offene Kisten mit zerbrechlichen Dingen, unhandliche und schwere, bis zum Bersten vollgepackte Kartons, unzerlegte Billy-Regale und Unmengen an anderem Kram von der Wohnung in den Transporter zu tragen. W\u00e4hrenddessen musste sie noch Geschirr auseinandersortieren und \u00fcberall in der Wohnung tauchten im Lauf des Tages \"\u00fcberraschenderweise\" noch einzelne Dinge auf. \n\nIch bin gestern, am Sonntag, um 7 Uhr aufgestanden, was nat\u00fcrlich nicht der beste Start in den Tag war. Losgehen sollte es um halb 9, letztendlich haben wir wegen der ganzen Sortiererei, die f\u00fcr meine Mitbewohnerin anscheinend v\u00f6llig unerwartet kam, aber erst um 11 angefangen. \n\nSo. Ich verstehe, dass man sich versch\u00e4tzen kann, was ben\u00f6tigte Zeit und Platz angeht, zumal das ja durch die Dyskalkulie quasi vorprogrammiert ist. Das kann jedem passieren, vor allem, wenn der letzte Umzug schon ein paar Jahre zur\u00fcckliegt und man sich kaum daran erinnert. Ich kann auch verstehen, dass die Tage vor einem Umzug stressig sind und man einiges vergisst, was einem dann vielleicht erst w\u00e4hrend des Umzugs auff\u00e4llt.\n\nWas mich aber unglaublich \u00e4rgert, ist, dass meine Freundin nicht daraus lernt. Auch nachdem ich mit ihr dar\u00fcber geredet habe, sieht sie nicht ein, dass die ganze Aktion uns alle wesentlich weniger Zeit und Energie gekostet h\u00e4tte, wenn sie in den Tagen zuvor einfach all ihren Kram in Umzugskartons verpackt h\u00e4tte. Folglich gibt es von ihr auch keine Entschuldigung daf\u00fcr, dass mein gesamter Sonntag von dieser ineffizienten Aktion eingenommen wurde. (Ich hatte versprochen zu helfen und wollte das auch einhalten, wobei ich irgendwann wegen meiner R\u00fcckenschmerzen nur noch leichte Sachen getragen habe). \n\nAu\u00dferdem \u00e4rgert mich, und das ist ein wiederkehrendes Thema, dass sie trotz ihrer Dyskalkulie nicht um Hilfe beim Planen bittet, bzw. Hilfe ausschl\u00e4gt, wenn man sie ihr anbietet. Ich kann schon gar nicht mehr aufz\u00e4hlen, wie oft Situationen mit ihr dadurch unn\u00f6tig verkompliziert und in die L\u00e4nge gezogen wurden. Wenn man es ihr sagt, reagiert sie besch\u00e4mt und entschuldigt sich unterw\u00fcrfig, ABER SIE LERNT EINFACH NICHT DARAUS. BEIM N\u00c4CHSTEN MAL MACHT SIE DAS GLEICHE WIEDER!   \nUnd sie scheint nicht zu merken, dass sie damit die Geduld, Zeit und Energie der Menschen um sie herum ziemlich strapaziert. Wenn ich sie dann darauf aufmerksam mache, prallt es an ihr ab. \"Hilfe beim Umzug\" scheint f\u00fcr sie nicht beim Kistenschleppen, sondern beim Einpacken anzufangen und die Helfer\\*innen m\u00fcssen sich eben damit abfinden, dass so gut wie nichts organisiert ist und ihr gesamter Tag f\u00fcr den Umzug draufgeht. Ich finde das ziemlich egozentrisch und ich wei\u00df echt nicht, wie ich ihr das noch begreiflich machen kann, damit es Klick macht. Ich sch\u00e4tze, das liegt einfach nicht in meiner Macht.\n\nFun fact: sie ist sonst oft selbst diejenige, die sich \u00fcber schlecht organisierte Dinge aufregt. Nur bei sich selber sieht sie es nicht. Ich bin sonst eher die Chaotische von uns, aber wenn es darum geht, dass ich anderer Leute Zeit beanspruche, \u00fcbernehme ich daf\u00fcr auch die Verantwortung.\n\nImmerhin habe ich jetzt daraus gelernt: wann immer ich in Zukunft gebeten werde, bei einem Umzug mitzuhelfen, werde ich nachfragen, wie die betreffende Person denn gedenkt, diesen zu organisieren. Ich werde fragen, wie viele Kartons es ungef\u00e4hr sind und wie lang es dauern soll. Wenn ich aus der Antwort heraush\u00f6re, dass der Umzug \u00e4hnlich aussieht wie der gestrige, werde ich meine Grenzen klarmachen und sagen, dass ich nur  vern\u00fcnftig gepackte Kartons trage und nur eine bestimmte Anzahl an Stunden zur Verf\u00fcgung stehe. Ich lasse mich f\u00fcr solche schlecht geplanten Aktionen nicht mehr einspannen."

You can't convince me otherwise, this character looks stupid when fighting. She wields a two-handed longsword with one hand in defense stance then suddenly snaps to warden animations when entering chains. It's awful and needs to be fixed. Another example is due to Shaolin's rework upon entering Qi stance from dodge attacks his entire body and staff snaps into a new position that it was NOT in, it looks awful.\n\nThere are other examples but these are some of the most obvious. We need to make a point to not accept this. It was not always like this, during covid it was understandable, but now it is time for UBI to meet the standards they set in the past. There is no reason for UBI to confidently release botched, ugly content like this when it was never the norm to do so in the past. \n\nUBI, it is 100% fine to have placeholder animations in testing grounds, no one expects full fledge animations for content that may never make it in the game, we understand that.

                "body": "Hey everyone. I believe I recently started to develop HPPD but I'm looking for confirmation and to see if anyone has similar experiences to me, or was able to come back from it. I dabbled in psyches as a teenager starting around 16 until I was around 19/20 trying acid about 4 times mushrooms probably like 8 times, and dxm 4 times, while also being a daily weed smoker. My activity with these drugs was at its peak from age 17-18, with a slowdown at 19 and a complete halt at 20. Funnily enough, I quit psyches because I was concerned if I didn't my luck would run out and I'd get HPPD. In the past I always had EXTREMELY mild visual snow and if I focused super hard on a surface I could make it wave around like water. Nowadays that's still the case with the wavey walls and stuff. Only VS got worse. After quitting psyches, I never stopped smoking weed which I smoked daily and at the age of 23... Boom. Mild HPPD.\n\nIt started in mid spring 2021 which progressed and forced me to quit weed in August 2021. Since August, it's been at a stand still. Not better, not worse. For the previous year leading up to this, I had actually lost the use of my hands without suffering extreme pain, had to quit numerous jobs due to it, had to quit video games, using my phone was painful, working with my hands was painful, I experienced constant, never ending anxiety that I would never be able to do things I loved again. I tried to mask this by smoking cannabis all the time, which only ended up making me feel worse a lot of the time. And as I finally found a way out of my hand and joint pain which I was able to revert through significant dietary changes among other natural efforts, the HPPD began... \n\nHere are my symptoms:\nIt started as seeing random spots of colours on walls, the ground, and so on out of the corner of my eye but when I would inspect them, they'd vanish instantly. This became more frequent, and eventually these colours would stay in my vision and fade after a minute or so. Overtime between spring and august, my visual snow that I had for years and never bothered me got twice as bad, I developed afterimages of outlines of things I see if they're against a contrasting background when I first see them, when I look away from lights the light stays in my vision for a brief time, depending on how bright it is, and it's colour is always maintained for a second before it becomes the opposite colour (red stoplights transition to blue/green and fade when I look away, green goes to red). Bright headlights turn to black and create little spots in my vision that I can't really see through, because they're so much brighter these stay in my vision for a few minutes which makes night driving a bit of a headache if I look at headlights driving towards me. Besides that I'm now very sensitive to light so I need sunglasses outside, sometimes even when it's cloudy, glares are way more prominent and blinding than ever, I have a lot to blue field phenomena and I have tons of eye floaters that my eye doctors can't seem to find, though I'm very familiar now with all of them. Reading text is a bit annoying as sometimes it feels like the dots on \"i\", commas, other punctuation move in my peripheral but overall I can still read just fine. \n\nAnyways, I've found my symptoms get worse if I smoke weed, drink alcohol, or consume caffeine. While I quit weed in August 2021, I wasn't able to kick alcohol and caffeine to the curb til late Feb/early March this year since I loved coffee and enjoyed a couple beers every other weekend with my new friends. \n\nStill what concerns me is that I've very much been at a standstill despite quitting all these substances and I got HPPD years after quitting psyches in the first place, which makes me think that I'll never get my old vision back, I'll never be able to enjoy cannabis, beers or coffee again, and that this is a permanent thing I'll always have to deal with. Has anyone else had this happen to them, and if so we're you ever able to get back to normal and even return to cannabis, alcohol, caffeine and such? (Obviously not psyches, haven't been interested in them for years) I appear to be the only one of my old friends with this problem and they all did much more psyches than I did. Feels like a cruel hex has been placed on me these last 2 1/2 years."

If there is something that you\u2019re thankful for in front of you, or if you can put something like that in front of you, I think it might actually help you negate whatever \u201cbad\u201d feeling you felt (it\u2019s probably a trigger from your past that is only loosely related to the present moment) even if you don\u2019t know why the feeling started. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just describing another way to recognize mindfulness. Heck, you could be thankful for the ottoman in front of you because it helps you relax: literally put your feet up on it. and I think that might be a nice pull into the present moment from being triggered by some past moment screwing up your current feelings. Ultimately, I think it\u2019d be best to practice mindfulness and being thankful for the good relationships currently in your life.  Like dissect this moment: simply calling a friend saying hello into realizing they\u2019ve had a whole day you have NO idea about and be happy you\u2019re a friendly part of it. Like for real, that would make me switch from sad to happy pretty quick. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

They will never live life the way you can, even though they make it seem like they can, or you think in your mind that they can. They're not happy. They need external validation to keep up with a fake persona. On their own they're nothing. You are. You can feel the rain on your face and feel alive. You can look at a deer and feel excited that it's close to you. You are alive inside. Feeling the pain and anger are part of that.",

(Are you besties in a month already, does the guy want your kids within a month etc)\n- Take breaks. Don't speak to them for a few days, focus on you. If this makes you nervous, figure out why. Is it them or a fear within you? How do they respond to it and how does that make you feel? \n- Watch how they speak about others. Are they capable of saying 'I am angry at this person, I was hurt by this person' or do they just call them names: is it black & white? Do they mention examples where they themselves might have gone wrong when there was an issue with someone? \n- Are they capable of imagining how you must be feeling?\n\nFor me these are very important things to check regularly.

I've been in denial about it for a long time but admittedly it is quite lonely and sad every year. I don't feel wanted at all. I try to hide it by appearing happy, but truly, I miss somewhere to belong. \n\nSo I would love to have a Christmas card sent to feel like I belong somewhere if you don't mind!\ud83d\ude0a.\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit: Woah, I had no idea there would be responses, let alone so many of you!  I think I've messaged everyone now!\nIt almost feels surreal you'd want to send me cards. I know that sounds a bit sentimental but admitting I've been lonely was quite difficult and I didn't expect much because it felt a bit selfish to ask it for myself. \n\nSo thank you. Just the idea of you wanting to send me cards has already warmed my heart so much.\ud83d\udc99"

Cause it's not one thing. \n\nI have an example of how it goes:\nYou try to tell someone a story about a man who looked through the window, saying to himself that the woman was beautiful.  Now this sounds like a man wandering his thoughts, realising someone is beautiful.\n\nWhen I add to the story: what a beautiful woman, the man said to himself, looking through the window from the streets. - It becomes a bit creepier, but still, your gaze could fall on someone through a window and the thought could pass. \n\nBut then more context is needed. 'what a beautiful woman, the man thought to himself, looking through the window from the streets, hidden in the bushes. - you start thinking okay this is shady, but maybe he's embarrassed.\n\nThe more context you give, the more crazy it becomes.\n\n'What a beautiful woman, the man thought to himself, looking through the window from the streets, hidden in the bushes, naked' - add touching himself to it and the first sentence is now one big creepshow. \n\nSee how much context is needed before the first sentence is even remotely interpreteted the way it should be? This is what it feels like to me explaining it. Before you're even remotely done explaining what the hell has gone on, they've already interrupted questioning the situation with their interpretation of that little piece of context they have. It's almost a repeated cycle of feeling gaslit all over again and I hate it. \n\nAnyone relate?\n\nEdit: someone commented they'd love to talk to me, but I can't find the comment.

To me running is a form of emotional processing where I start out really stressed and slowly I get more into my body and start getting happier (dancing to my music and stuff) or more sad/angry (emotions need to come out). When my body is tired I stop. I run intuitively and I honestly don't give a shit about the distance I run. Is it really that rare or are there more people who run like this?\n\nEdit: I'm not saying it's wrong, but I used to keep track and that was purely from an eating disordered mindset. Without the ED it has no significance to me other than controlling my self image through achievement. So I was just wondering if there are more people who experience that and prefer going without tracking."

In the middle of the conversation, I've also forgotten a lot of times about what I ate and when I ate so sometimes I end up eating more, sometimes I feel like I don't feel pain unless it's like really bad, I hit my head on the corner of a table when I fell and I didn't feel anything at all, unless it knocked me out and I wasn't aware of it I didn't feel a thing and just went on with my day\n\nThere's probably a lot more that I can't think of but I've had this kind of stuff happen to me since I was a child and I never questioned it but I am now questioning it, sorry I was so sporadic with my typing and the stuff I said was so disorganised but I just had to get it out there before I probably forget, also I'm pretty sure I said forget like 500 times"

But I personally think it would be better if people didn't have children anymore.\n\nIf you can tell me a reason for having kids that is for the kid's sake, but people have up to now failed to do that. It's always about their fulfillment and joy, how they want to be parents. For the kid their decision doesn't solve any problems it doesn't first create. If we think it's better to avoid using other people for your own gain without consent in real life then why not extent this thought to procreation? Even more so because in case of the latter it's never necessary. \n\nPeople pretend it's only about mom and dad and I reject that. It's also about this new person that now has to roll with all the punches life is going to throw at them. We don't want to force someone to go to the film against their will but we do force someone to be here 80+ years and join the cruel contest for survival. All the problems that might come with it: mental and physical health problems, poverty, terminal illness, loneliness, saying goodbye to your loved ones, war, famine, existential angst etc. That's one bad movie for sure, even for those who are lucky. They lean on the suffering others have to endure to help them have such a life. \n\nI cannot force this on others however, if someone gets a kid that is more challenged than usually I don't give a fuck about the hardships that follow from it for the parents. They decided to roll the dice and knew that basically anything could happen. The child is the one who has to live with this, without consenting to it, and the one I do feel for.\n\nThere is no undo button. And nowadays we do have the means to not get or have others get pregnant. To me that at the very least gives us the responsibility to think about this stuff.\n\nFor me it's not about solving the world's problems per se. I think it's solving the individual's problem. If there is even a slight chance of someone suffering greatly in life, that's enough moral incentive I need to not reproduce and force such a life to be.

There is no \"undo\" button. \n\nI think having children just creates a new group of perpetrators and victims (and often they become both of them). It's and endless, unnecessary and unnecessarily cruel cycle to me. \n\nI have a few reasons more. But as I said it's a personal belief and choice. I don't know how others experience their consciousness. \n\nSo yeah, I'm atheist and antinatalist, and I don't believe there are good reasons to have kids.

The island is small enough for bikes (especially e-bikes) to be a serious mode of transport, yet we haven't seen any people riding bikes here.\n\nI get that with differences in altitude it might not be for everyone, but e-bikes could change this significantly. \n\nIt just seems such a suitable island for more or less eliminating cars. \n\nWe're curious what the rationale for not using (e-)bikes more is. \n\nThanks so much for your answers :)\n\nEdit within minutes: I also understand that traffic can be busy and thus increasing the danger for people riding bikes.

He cast an unconcentrated glance at the clock that, much like a metronome does, ticked away a simple beat. The clock revealed that it was 2.30 am. For a change he had gone to bed at 11 pm, but it barely helped him in his fight against insomnia. It was a battle he had waged for multiple months now. His bloodshot eyes did not want to close, no one wanted to take him away to a land of dreams, a place of silence and tranquility. And so at night he found himself staring out of the window a lot. From his apartment he could see a desolate parking lot where he saw junkies wandering about, probably completing a nightly walk. The feeble light that a few of the working street lights were still able to produce, was robbed of its power too much to prevent him from seeing junkies injecting themselves with heroin and the few of them that were just having sex on the lot. Like they were dancing a madman\u2019s dance. \n\nThe latter was actually a blessing. He looked at the sleep pills that were located on the small table in front of the tv. They gently beckoned for his attention. He decided that it was too early. He tried to hinder dependency, but at a certain point in time you had to ask yourself whether the disease was worse than the cure. For now he decided to keep the pills in their packaging. The clock with its thin, black hands told him it was now 2.37 am. The street lights cast a greenish light. The colour was subtle, but unmistakenbly green. He found it to resemble a mix between turquoise and mint. A last attempt of the city council to decrease light pollution and increase playing around with nature. This ideal was rendered without chance in advance when it came to the area in front of him. Paving stones dominated the view, here and there you could see a few bushes and some trees at the edge of the parking lot. The green light cast a sinister glow on the tree trunks, the branches that because of this began to look like claws and the weak shadows that were more frightening than anything you could ever encounter in a nightmare. The shadows were that scary because they were real. They were the shadows of real people and real trees.\n\nHe grabbed the little blue box with the grey strips from the table and walked to the bathroom. To get there he had to navigate his way through a dark hallway. There could have been light in the hallway but the lamp had broken and he hadn\u2019t have had the time to replace it. At least, that was what he told himself, there had been plenty of time, but he had not used it. The eery green glow from outside projected manes on the walls of the hallway. The light seemed like it had become stronger, but he convinced himself that these were tricks of a sleep deprived mind. Still, he walked to the bathroom as fast as he could. He pressed the light button that was situated directly outside the bathroom next to the door. The light immediately salvated him from the dancing shadows on the wall. The bath he had put in the bathroom beckoned to him. He let himself be convinced quickly, hoping that the warm, gracious water would help him in his quest for a good night\u2019s sleep. He longed for a visit of the Sandman. He hoped the little guy would soon be able to rescue him from this languid, vague intermediate phase he found himself to be a habitant of. \n\nHe turned on the faucet and looked at his own deformed reflection in its shiny metal. It disrupted his image, but his bloodshot eyes, the wan skin and the tousled hair told the true story. His hair was blonde, always had been, but now it looked like it had no colour at all. The wrinkles on his face slowly became deep channels which you could follow from beginning to end. The bags under his eyes were dyed deep blue and resembled the most deep oceans on earth. If he could have drown in these deep pools, he would have done it some time ago. Without a moment of hesitation he would jump in the dark, blue abyss and he would sleep forever. Instead he had to make do with the shallow bath in front of him. Drowning in this tub would be a challenge, even for someone who longed for it the way he did.  \n\nHe undressed himself and kicked his boxerhorts to the other side of the small bathroom. The bath had just fit inside the room, but it had been a wish he wanted to make reality. He lowered himself into the white bowl, the water pulled on his body, it did not let go and dragged him into the warm, benevolent water. He had lost his entire body in the bath tub. He slowly started to relax, shut his eyes and then opened them again in total darkness. Panickly he turned his eyes towards the former source of light but of course he couldn\u2019t see a thing. The lamp was probably done for. The second one he would have to replace.\n\nHe figured he\u2019d have a spare one fort his type of lamp. He raised himself out of the water, for a moment it seemed like the water pulled him back, but he manage to step on the cold, tile floor. Drunkenly he walked to the closet in which he kept his spare light bulbs. He quite quickly found the right bulb and took it to the bathroom. The wet foot prints he had left all over the floor reflected a dark, green light that found his way into his apartment from outside. Before he could even realize it, he found himself on the damp floor. A sharp pain spread from his right eye to his mouth via his right cheek and nose. He glanced at the clock in front of him. The clock which hanged above the door to his study, this had been a useless little joke of his, told him it was 3.06 am. In front of him shards of glass were dispersed all over the floor. Also in front of him was a little red piddle, but it seemed to come from far away. It certainly did not come from his body, the source had to be something alien. The clock ticked an evil, heavy rhythm. Far off in the distance he heard the gloomy, vile tones of a piano being played by what seemed to be a monstrous creature. It had to be his imagination, he thought. He placed his hand on his right cheek in an attempt to feel where the pain was coming from. He immediately pulled it back. The cheek was done for, it had ripped and he had felt his own tongue through it!\n\nA little pool which, with the green light that came from outside, shed a malevolent glow grew in front of him. He smelled a sweet irony scent and realized it had to be blood. His tongue was accessible without opening his mouth. The smell of iron mixed with the lavender from the oil he had used for his bath. A sickening, twisted aroma filled his entire apartment. The manes on the wall seemed to be happily dancing. An unbearable pain filled his body with a swiftness that surprised him. He hoped, then felt, that he would lose consciousness very quickly. It would be a welcome break from his continuous awareness, his cursed lack of sleep. He embraced the slowly onsetting unconsciousness. He would never be more close to sleep again. A hopeless case. The shadows on the wall crept and danced in his direction, but he already wasn\u2019t aware anymore. He slept a dreamless sleep. \n\nThree days later Vera Lichtenvoorde hovered over a corpse in a tiny apartment with a window view of a parking lot. Another window in the apartment watched out over a park entrance. It was a gorgeous green paradise in the middle of a stone wasteland. In the bathroom, a now cold, bath was slowly evaporating into the air. The water level had already dropped a significant amount, a small, barely visible rim in the bath tub evidenced that much. In the hall a true bloodbath had been building up. But like time does, the water in the blood had begun evaporating too. This had made the blood into a thick, gooey substance. Vera could hardly stand the sickening, sweet smell of decomposition. She looked at the opened throat of the unfortunate former person. A hand rested just underneath it. In it was a bloody shard. The cheek was mutilated by what seemed to be glass from a light bulb. The lamp base was located a few inches to the right. A small shard, still attached to the base, seemed submerged in a thick, red molasses. \n\n\u201cPresumably\u2026\u201d Vera sighed for a moment. She\u2019d done this type of work for years and while she had become significantly less sensitive it was never easy. \u201cPresumably the victim fell down while holding a light bulb. His cheek was mutilated by the glass. The victim then went into shock and took his own life with one of the shards from the broken bulb.\u201d The guy next to her directly wrote down what she had said. He did so with long, quick strokes. They covered the body in front of her and carried ita way. The evening was on the doorstep and the sunlight started retreating. The green glow lit up the hall. Behind Vera the manes danced their sickening, disturbing dance on the walls. The door locked with a heavy sound behind her."

And by that I mean all its parts: the tripod, the equatorial mount, the telescope tube, the knobs, oculars, motordrive and counterweights. I've been looking online but it seems to me all the travel bags for this telescope are for the tube only. Maybe I'm wrong about that but because of covid I can't go to the store.\n\nI would just like to take it with me when we go discover the dark skies of Europe (for example in the south centre of France between Clermont-Ferrand and Limoges). \n\nThanks in advance for your two cents on this.\n\nPS. Yesterday I got hooked on my new hobby. We were able to see the moon in such amazing detail. Far beyond what my little telescope I used to own when I was 12 years old could do. We also saw Sirius, Betelgeuse and Procyon. We had seen Rigel, Polaris and the Pleiades before, but it was for more strenuous and the nights were way colder then. Let me just say I really look forward to clear summer night skies."

Back to today: we had just returned from a walk and some chill time in the park. My girlfriend looked up from the film and yelled: \"wow, look at the moon!\" It was amazing. I decided we had to look through the telescope. It was brilliant. The moon was enchanting, the stars where shining brighter each minute in the dusk. We got to see Sirius, Procyon and Betelgeuse. We are hooked. What a great hobby and the best money ever spent! :)\n\nThe movie we were watching: deadpool. Got to say I enjoyed the moon and stars more."

Hardly any friendship is forever. She's not necessarily at fault for no longer liking you, but she is at fault with using you at a stepping-stool. Tell her you are done communicating with her, and if she approaches you, even if she seems to want you back, don't do it. It will all go right back to the painful place you've been put in.\n\nI'd also recommend being firm and setting boundaries for yourself. Nobody except your closest family should hold any power over you. Girls really don't likely clingy people. When talking to a girl, I'd recommend keeping it short and straight to the point especially when texting.\n\nThe best way to get her out of your mind isn't to forget, that won't work, but to replace her with someone else. Make the effort to talk to another girl, maybe someone who you know is positive towards others, cause they most likely will be positive with you.\n\nAnd PLEASE respect yourself and your boundaries.

I got a UTI on Monday and I didn\u2019t go to school on Monday, I went to school yesterday and made it through 2nd period until I left school, and last night I thought I wouldn\u2019t be in enough pain to stop me from going today, but here I am, in a lot of pain. I\u2019ve been taking medicine for it since yesterday. Also, due to a concussion happening to me in October, I have missed a lot of school. I know my mom is stressed about a lot of stuff, and my younger brother has some stuff happening to him that I forgot the name of, but it\u2019s made him go to the hospital earlier this semester. Anyways, I know that the pain would get worse as this isn\u2019t the first UTI I\u2019ve gotten. However, I feel really bad for being in pain because I do want to fo to school because I like school and I want to go so my parents don\u2019t get upset, but I don\u2019t want to move around in my seat all day and drink a lot of water while my teachers refuse to let me go to the restroom during class because the 4 minute passing periods don\u2019t give me enough time. I feel like I made this post more about me trying to defend myself, which isn\u2019t really how I want it to sound. I just feel awful because I didn\u2019t mean to make my mom cry due to me feeling awful and not feeling good enough to go to school. If I start to feel better and when my migraine goes away, I\u2019m going to try and study for school, so hopefully I can get better grades to make up for these stupid things happening to me."

                "body": "Alright, I picked up this game to play with my friends and oh boy, this is what I ever wanted from a zombie survival game.\n\nWell the problem is I can't really enjoy the game single player, I feel sick while playing the game the feeling of isolation is pretty much giving me stomach cramps. But also I just started a new run with a friend that I teach the ropes of the game I have no issues, I can take 15 zombies at once without panicking or feeling anything.\n\nThis is a first for me because I can casually watch horror movies, thrillers not to mention the TWD for sleeping. Maybe I am too immersed in the game, creating a char that both resembles to me and uses my real name.\n\nThe screams when a character dies just\u2026 makes me really.. I don't know the feeling, but it is a bad thing, that's for sure.\n\nIf you all can give me some advices on how to overcome these feelings, that would be appreciated.\n\nEdit/Update: Thank you all for sharing your experience and giving me some solid advices. I've figured out that when I turn off the music, lower the jump scare SFX and open some 90s Japanese City Pop, I feel much more relaxed. It doesn't strip away that horror aspect of the game, but I can at least play the game.  Also, I found a mod named \u201cSixth Sense\u201d which is pretty much a trait that warns me if there is a zombie in my vicinity.\n\nOnce again, thank you all for your advices. I wasn't expecting this community to care about this post."

It takes so much strength and will power to do this, and you're gonna get though this \u2764\ufe0f\n\nY'all are amazing \ud83e\udd70\n\nSorry in advance but this post is going to be a little long, beacaue I'm stoned and I really need to vent right now.\nNow, my story.\n\nAs long as I can remember, my childhood was messed up. Not \"that bad\" but my mothe barely even looked at for me when I was a child, gaslighting me, threatening me to sent me to the orphanage, well you got the picture. (thanks god she's better now).\n\nShe was just SO emotionally cold towards me, and I felt like I didn't even exist. Like a ghost. She was in a depressive state too I think (and I understand that), but please, just send me to a foster family who will actually love me instead of keeping me in this environment who's going to mess my mental health permanently.\n\nThen, i started to throw thanthrows because I just wanted to have some attention from my parents, but all they did was be angry at me.\nMy dad told me I was crazy, unrecoverable.etc and my mom said I was \"born mad\".\nAll I wanted for them is to tell me things like \"what's make up angry like that\", \"explain it to us, maybe we can help\" \nBut nooo, everytime they sent to to the psychiatrist like this was some kind of magic cure that would make me \"normal\" again.\n\nIt was verbal agression after verbal agression.\nMy dad even told indirectly to my mom that he regret my birth multiple times, told me I would never be a doctor when I'll grow up one time because my grades weren't good enough, and my mom told me she thought she would be happy by having me but I'm only making her feel worse. And there's a lot of things like that but it would be too long too explain\n\n\n\nAnyway.\nEnough with the childhood trauma and now let's talk about the long term consequences of that.\nI have been suffering from anxiety as long as I can remember. Obsessive over particular things  (like checking me bag 5 times before going out, make sure I locked my apartment etc), having nervous twitches (blinking exes excessively, twitching my mouth etc) and all of that.\n\nMy first psychiatrists gave me benzos, xanax usually.\nAnd oh boy. This is where it all started.\nThe first time i took it it was like total silence.\nNo internal thoughts screaming at me how ugly, worthless and stupid I am, but pure peace. Just a big break that made me feel normal again.\nImagine walking into a desert for hours, dehydrated, and you can suddenly drink your favorite drink. Best feeling in the worst, isn't ?\n\nI got xanax every 3-4 months and back then I took it reasonably at first (like, not everyday).Then , I started to take 1 per day, 2 per day, 3 etc...\nAnd most of the time I binged it and took like 2-3 mg once or twice a week.\n\nIt's important to say that I went to multiple doctors to  get xanax or any benzo at this point. I got the meds, and usually i ate the pills in 2 days or even one night,. resulting in a mass mindfuck the next day because I'm incapable of remember what the hell I did last night, mostly sending cringy messages to people, going on shopping sprees to buy some useless craps like dolls, plushies, furbies or makeup \u2620\ufe0f)\n\nI remember (I don't really remember at all actually, I had sort of \"flashbacks\" when I saw something I bought when I was out of it etc) this night where I straight up took like 13-14mg one night and I literally blackout for a week \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) I genuinely though my account has been hacked but no, it was just me posting stupid stuffs.\n\nI'm also taking Prozac, which helped me a liiitle bit for my anxiety (but I'm going to talk about my psychiatrist because I feel like Prozac isn't working anymore,l\nI've been \"xanax sober\" since like, 3 months (I almost quit cold turkey honestly. I know it can be dangerous and I don't recommend it to anyone. It was horrible, I couldn't sleep, I was sick after eating, constant nausea, slight plain and the list goes on)  but since I have a lot of anxiety since a few weeks, I just couldn't resist anymore.\n\nI feel like crap, because I was like ' I want to know i'll be able to control my xanax consumption because i haven't take it in months, but obviously, no lol.\n\nSo I'm definitely going to talk to my therapist about it next week."

Esta crema es muy efectiva puesto que el hamamelis cuenta con\u00a0propiedades antiinflamatorias, as\u00ed como\u00a0propiedades astringentes.\n\nPara preparar esta pomada casera necesitar\u00e1s estos ingredientes:\n\n60 mililitros de parafina l\u00edquida\n4 cucharadas de c\u00e1scaras de hamamelis\n60 mililitros de glicerina\n\nLo primero que haremos ser\u00e1 mezclar la parafina y las c\u00e1scaras de hamamelis en una cacerola y dejaremos que ambos ingredientes hiervan durante 5 minutos. Pasado este tiempo, tan solo deber\u00e1s colar y a\u00f1adir la glicerina a la mezcla. Gu\u00e1rdalo en un recipiente de cristal y con cierre herm\u00e9tico y usa esta crema siempre que sientas picor en la zona anal.",

If it was Matt who killed Will and Collette didn't have a say in it, what's stopping her from going to the police? Matt already knows she cheated. And why on earth would she call Addy to see the body? What was the point in doing that? Addy never had to be involved with Will's death but for some reason, Collette decides to call a cheerleader in after finding a dead body? Again, what is stopping Addy from telling the police that the coach asked her to keep it a secret? Could someone explain this?"

This of course let\u2019s you know that you are potentially 135, and more likely 130+. You should take an official test in real life if you want to say with certainty. Official tests test a lot more indexes - which all combine into a full-scale iq - than only fluid reasoning. Note: fluid reasoning has a great correlation with g and therefore other indexes typically, this is why Mensa.no typically gives good ballparks (the word \u201ctypically\u201d is key)",

                "body": "This is a tool I decided to make as a fun project using Unity.\n\nI especially designed this tool to follow the format of WAIS/WISC, it has three sections (Forward, backward and sequence.) Most importantly, this test does not repeat numbers (However there are a few exceptions, but that is in service of following the format of WAIS/WISC.) There are two tries per digit length, this provides a raw that is the sum of all successes for each digit span index, along with that it provides a digit span per index, which is the highest digit able to be repeated. Edit: This doesn't seem to work on phone, sorry about it. (Try an emulator if possible)\n\nI'm going to hardcode this into the program later, but in the meantime here are the norms for digit span (From the Spanish WAIS-IV). Simply add all your raw scores together and look at this table to translate it into scaled score. [https://imgur.com/ehTdvIM](https://imgur.com/ehTdvIM). Once you have the scaled score, you can translate it into relative score by looking at this chart  [https://imgur.com/oLain0r](https://imgur.com/oLain0r). Or by simply doing the equation: (YourSScore-10)/3+100. This score will be somewhat depictive of working memory index however it needs to be joined with other subtests to be solidly depictive of working memory.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nPlease remove 4 raw from your total raw and then compare for an accurate score. This is needed in order to follow the WAIS (Since WAIS starts at 2 digits, not 1. However the backward is different, since it's supposed to repeat 2 digits four times. Therefore 4 raws get removed and not 6.) I will fix this soon\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nAn extra note because I think it may give confusion: The \"Next\" button moves to the next index.\n\nPlease tell me if you find any bugs!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n[https://sharemygame.com/@Vix/vadst](https://sharemygame.com/@Vix/vadst)"

As soon as its all done, and while all that stress is subsiding at last; the pain of knowing that you've not lived up to everyone's expectations, not even yours, takes its place.\n\nI try not to let it affect me but every time my dad looks at me  he looks with those big black beady eyes, somehow emitting that strong feeling of sadness and disappointment, knowing that his son couldn't reach his goal nor could he even smell  it-even if he doesn't show it you can just tell. Keeping my head up may have proven to be a difficult feat, seeing as how everyone else around you seems to have been expecting far more than what has been achieved.\n      \n And so, the quest of seeking yet another approval began, the quest of universities. GJU, was the first that I had applied for, seeing as my inability to reach the goal that was set in my mind has diminished, I went for one that might fulfill another desire, studying abroad. Disappointed yet understanding, I kept going, applying for industrial engineering as my first choice; something that I don't fully understand nor is it even close to what my heart may desire, which, to be honest, I have absolutely no idea where my heart truly lies. \n\nFollowed by a major that I'd say that has been dear to me ever since the beginning of time, which might sound odd, it's non other than energy engineering, but being able to solve humanity's everlasting problemor just contributing to it has always been a thought that never leaves my mind, still it was not my first choice.\n\nAs for filling in the last choice, I had to go with a major that takes two of my favorite subjects and puts them together; chemistry and biology; pharmaceutical and chemical engineering yet it has a trait in jobs that I've always discarded and hated; the simplicity and staying put, or so I've heard.\n\n     \n I applied for about four other universities with multiple choices; computer science, engineering and pharmacy, of course those were merely a backup plan, in case I was rejected (story of my Life). Seeing as how everyone was pushing me towards applying to a university I did not at all want to apply for, I snapped. Hard. Something I almost never do, which resulted in raised eyebrows and hatred developed.\n\nAt the end of the day, I felt more lost and helpless than I've ever had, and the phase of depression started kicking in that is until I've learned that everyone else is going through almost the same shit I've went through.\n\nAnd to end it all, I'll just have to wait for either rejection or acceptance; hopefully the latter, of course.\n\n      \nMight post an update on the acceptance in about a week or so."

I freaked and pretended that I saw and dodged bird poop, therefore hitting the girl behind me instead.\n\nIt was the first or second week of the school year. I had no friends and knew nobody, nor did I know how a normal public high school's social cliques worked. I had gone to a very small school of no more than 100 kids from 1st-9th grade and now was going to a career center with kids across 15+ schools (a collection of about 400 students). I had been talking to the girl and some others within a few seats vicinity and got excited.\n\nThe worst part was that the kids in the back (as everyone knows) were the wanna-be popular kids and trouble makers who had no problem shaming someone and spreading rumors more often than any others. (I sat in the middle almost religiously). They overheard the multiple loud \"EWWWS\" that ensued (which is why I so very quickly denied that I had spat out the window and rather it was bird poop when asked).\nThen, not a single person had a napkin or an extra cloth to wipe it off, so it just sat on her face for like a whole 5 minutes. I honestly don't remember how we got it off or what we gave her, but it wasn't done easily.\n\nI did immediately write her an apology letter for lying that night and secretly gave it to her the next morning. I explained what I feared, that I did not intend on spitting on her, and that i hoped that if we were to cross paths that we would be able to be friends. Thank goodness she was a sweet heart and said it was completely okay. Her friend did give me a snarky look, but it was never brought up again.and we never spoke after that either (we had no classes together and I believe she started taking a car soon after).\n\nSo yeah, I've definitely had plenty of dumb things come out of my mouth, but that's probably number one.\n\nTl;dr\n\nI spat out a bus window. It flew into the window behind me and hit a girl right in the face. I denied that I spat and rather claimed that it had to be bird poop. I wrote an apology letter to her in secret the following day. She accepted it and then we basically never saw each other again.\n\nYes, it was very dumb. My brain was not switched to \"on\"",

But if I don\u2019t play my openings, I\u2019d freeze. I even watched a video about how to deal with anxiety, but that didn\u2019t help much.

No.: PS84-204/2022E-PDF\n\nResearch at a Glance - PDF\n\nWhy we did this study\nIn accordance with Bill C-16, on December 27, 2017, the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) implemented its interim policy for gender diverse offenders to identify operational practices that may require accommodation for these offenders, particularly regarding the placement of offenders in a federal correctional institution of their gender preference. In addition, CSC policy established the requirement to develop Individualized Protocols (IPs) for gender diverse offenders in relation to issues such as showers and toilets, frisk and strip searches, urinalysis, decontamination showers, and spiritual ceremonies. This study was undertaken to provide a profile of federal gender diverse offenders in Canada during incarceration and explore how these offenders are accommodated in other correctional jurisdictions. Jurisdictional review findings are available in the full research report.\n\nWhat we did\nA total of 99 gender diverse offenders (47% Indigenous) were identified in the in-custody population between December 27, 2017 and March 13, 2020. Demographic, sentence, and offence information, institutional behaviour, and post-release outcomes were examined. Additional factors examined by file coding from the Offender Management System (OMS) were: operational accommodation preferences for these offenders, abuse and trauma histories, and sex offence characteristics for those in the study population with sex offending histories.\n\nWhat we found\nTrans-women were the largest group (62%) of gender diverse offenders indicated, followed by trans-men (21%) and the \"other\" groupFootnote1 (17%). Two-fifths (40%) of the study group were serving a second or subsequent sentence; these offenders had an established criminal history and the majority (86%) were convicted of violent offences. Overall, gender diverse offenders were identified as high static and dynamic risk, with 60% having a low reintegration potential. IPs were analyzed for all gender diverse offenders in relation to staff interactions,Footnote2 programming, and spiritual activity participation. Among offenders who indicated a preference related to staff interaction, offenders were more likely to identify preferences for female staff.\n\nIn terms of institutional adjustment, almost half of the study group had a guilty disciplinary charge while two-thirds had committed an institutional incident during the study period. Behavioural-related incidentsFootnote3 were most common, regardless of the study subgroup. Three-quarters (74%) of the study group completed correctional programs, with two-thirds (67%) completing moderate intensity programming. Two-thirds (62%) of offenders participated in educational interventions while almost half (42%) participated in institutional employment opportunities. Sixteen percent of offenders applied for a transfer to an institution that matched their gender identity; 64% were approved. The majority (88%) were for trans-women.\n\nFor all offenders conditionally released during the study period (n = 27), 37% were suspended. Trans-men had a higher proportion of suspensions (45%) compared to trans-women (16%) and the \"other\" group (17%).\n\nWhat it means\nThis study provides an initial descriptive profile of federal gender diverse offenders, who accounted for 0.4% of the general offender population. With enhanced data capacity for the identification of these offenders, future research will be able to expand on this work and enhance our knowledge concerning gender diverse offenders.\n\nFor more information\nFarrell MacDonald, S., Smeth, A., Cram, S., Garrel, S. & Derkzen, D.

                "body": "Yes, supplements can replace veggies. I'm off keto at the moment, going back on soon. But for several months all I ate was 3 nutritionally complete protein shakes a day (homemade Keto Chow based on their published recipe). The KC creator also did this for 100 days and logged his bloodwork during the process while trying different fats added to said shakes.\n\nVeggies are great because they're filling, and because many of their nutrients are natural craving busters. But don't feel like you actually *have* to eat a bunch of veggies if you're getting their benefits elsewhere. \n\nLike another comment mentioned, you also have to consider bioavailability. An example is one of the most common forms of magnesium (where I live, at least), magnesium oxide, has very poor bioavailability. Similarly, the bioavailability of cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate) is extremely bioavailable. Most forms of potassium aren't, but some are moreso than others. Phosphorous additives are more bioavailable than naturally occurring phosphorous, apparently. You'll also want to take several different supplements, preferably spaced throughout the day. E.G. cut your vitamin in half (or more) and space it apart, because taking them all at once also inhibits bioavailability (it's probably a bigger factor than it being \"not natural\").",

The ER has to accept you regardless of ability to pay and will set up a sliding scale payment plan.

Being overly emotional can be very annoying and I wouldn\u2019t say I get emotional either.\r\n\r\nIf I agree with someone its because I\u2019m getting bored and I want to leave or because I feel like im wasting to much energy with this conversation (maby because its becoming more of a I feel like ...)\r\n\r\nI would break rules if they are nonsensical if there is a reason why its in place and it makes logical sense aright but If its something I don\u2019t agree with and it has no logical backing I wouldn\u2019t follow it.\r\n\r\nA life where I have the resources to do as I please and am not controlled and need someone to support me"

She\u2019s recently-ish married her 5th husband who is 30 years older than her, and the affair that led to this and her insistence on shoving this relationship on the rest of the family has created major issues. She has cut me in and out of her will a couple of times, has been very hostile towards me, and I feel like I walk on eggshells every time I\u2019m around her. This being said, she goes through periods where she\u2019s super happy and upbeat and gushes over me and everyone. It\u2019s like a horrible emotional rollercoaster. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I practically have a trauma response whenever I even think about having to interact with her because I never know what to expect. This has only been affecting me, but recently there was an incident where she began to pout when I gently asked why she showed up to our house an hour early for a visit with my children, so she decided she no longer wanted to stay and turned around in my child\u2019s face and left. This upset him as he was looking forward to playing with his grandmother.\n\nI guess I want to know if I\u2019m wrong for no longer wanting anything to do with her. I haven\u2019t felt any connection to her for quite some time, but she historically throws fits and brings the whole family down when \u201cher children abandon her\u201d. I also feel guilty because (up until recently), my children haven\u2019t been negatively impacted, so should I deprive them of a \u201cloving\u201d grandparent? I don\u2019t want to act irrationally, but my number one priority is protecting my family. I also would love to never have to worry about interacting with her, but maybe that\u2019s me being selfish."

Any tips how to find the rune in the least painful way?\n\n\n\nBoth characters got swamped in the end (I could probably escape if I were better) but this was after multiple abyss runs, with no rune in sight. In fact, I'm a bit discouraged to go there ever again. Both characters were very strong. I went there at level 25 because it was the last moment to grab the exp reward, later it would be pretty much worthless. Is there a kind of character that's really not suitable for abyss? Like with nonexistent (or negative in the case of Qaz) stealth?"

We're used to playing games like Scythe, so I think it should be fun to bring something even bigger. I myself have had the pleasure of playing 3rd ed, but this was a while back. Unfortunately, we only have the base game because I bought it in English and all the PoKs available here are in my local language...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, I have two questions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. We have about 5 hours (6 tops) of gaming ahead of us. Unfortunately, I haven't managed to gather the group on a weekend to have the whole day. We're going to have 5 players. How would you go about shortening the game? Set the score to 8, or even lower?\n2. Two of the group are slightly better at tactical thinking than others (not me, sadly). How would you go about with the faction distribution? I know stuff like Arborec are out, but I worry that giving too easy to use a tool to some players would end with them predictably winning. Also, Necro seems to be a thing I would avoid until players have the intuition on when to engage an enemy and what they may expect to lose, unless I'm wrong?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny other tips are also welcome, thanks."

After talking to her about side effects i told her i have a very very dull small pain in my tummy that comes and goes as well as nausea. She said nausea isnt usually a typical side effect. We are continuing treatment so after i finish my 40 mg i go onto 30 mg twice a day. Does anyone think i should be worried about pancreatitis? Anyone have anything similar? The small pain and nausea is manageable and i had slight nausea due to a stomach bug i think (but no dull tummy pain) before i started.

I definitely get sacked on teams with terrible players or Terrible people, but every now and then I get one good player on my team that will overlook the three worse teammates and message me like I\u2019m the worst player in existence. \nI took a break from the game already and read only on the items I use. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to read every item and test every character, to find what works. I also know it\u2019s not necessary to stick to the script when picking for roles. Stats aren\u2019t at all important, like in-game strategy that achieves the win, is to me.\n\nIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m used to bagging all the bodies and now that someone else is getting the kills, I\u2019m butthurt. More like, I\u2019m doing what I do, and then I get gabled or outmatched with no support (still in respawn or fidgeting with a buff). I would just stay out of kill range but that isn\u2019t always possible without basically going afk in-lane or kill-hawking.\n\n I\u2019ll have good games with the Same builds, characters, role picks, & modes on another account (27), and do very well without many issues. Maybe a couple bad teammate players at most.\n\nI look at what I\u2019m doing and adjust, midgame, if I see what I\u2019m doing isn\u2019t working. \n\nBesides uninstalling, getting good, or some other \u201cI\u2019m not quite smart enough to provide anything useful so I\u2019ll try to laugh it off and hurt you cause I feel bad about myself\u201d answers... What may be a reason and a fix?\n\nObviously if you don\u2019t know or care or like the post or think it\u2019s stupid\u2026 don\u2019t reply\u2026"

Ik reken het de bezorger dan ook nog niet eens echt aan, maar vooral het bezorgbedrijf zelf (DHL in dit geval). Volgens mij krijgen die bezorgers gewoon veel te weinig tijd om elk pakketje fatsoenlijk te bezorgen of zo. \n\nSorry voor dit geklaag terwijl het geen woensdag is, maar moest het gewoon echt even kwijt.

I chewed them well and got really nauseated for like 30 minutes, but managed not to throw up and had a really good time after that, although the effects weren't as strong as I expected from reading a lot of info online (some Dutch webshops even call 10 grams a really strong dose...). I didn't really get visuals and I could use my phone and communicate with my boyfriend via discord just fine. But I had a good time listening to music and drawing and felt very euphoric the whole time, and afterwards people around me have told me I changed for the better. I definitely feel better too, I'm much better equipped to handle negative thoughts. So whatever. I don't need to be sent to another galaxy to be able to enjoy the experience and gain something out of it. \n\nBut because this experience was so enjoyable, I wanted to do it another time, but without the nausea this time, and have a bit of a stronger trip than the last time. So I waited a few weeks to reset my tolerance, and made tea from 25 grams of truffles today. As far as I know I did everything right: the water wasn't too hot, I cut the truffles into small pieces and let the mixture steep for 25 minutes, stirring from time to time.\n\nSo then I drank it (and it wasn't nearly as gross as I expected, thank God), got comfortable in bed with music, colourful lights and food, and waited. But I didn't feel much. I got the same feeling in my body as the last time, very akin to restless leg syndrome but less annoying thankfully, and did get a bit woozy in my head for a while, but not much more than that, and it wasn't very enjoyable. It felt like the truffles wanted to kick in, but couldn't get past a blockage of some kind. \n\nSo my question is, what gives? \n\nOne reason could be that I'm on Wellbutrin/bupropion (300 mg), which is a NDRI and works on dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, unlike the infamous SSRIs which work on serotonin, just like truffles. So it shouldn't have any effect in theory, but there are definitely accounts of people online who didn't trip (as hard as they expected) and blame Wellbutrin for it. But on the other hand, there's also plenty of accounts of people who tripped just fine on it.\n\nAnother reason could be that I'm just not very sensitive to psylocybin? \n\nOr maybe it's just that I didn't cut the truffles fine enough, even though I thought I did? \n[here's a picture of the leftovers](https://imgur.com/a/Axpcq3Q)\n\nIt's not such a big deal that nothing really happened this time, and like I said I don't need to be catapulted to another galaxy to have a good time, but I would like to visit another planet if that makes sense. To have an actual trip. And buying truffles only to get hardly any effect/a much lower effect than you would expect from the dose feels a bit of a waste of money, which I do not have a lot of, unfortunately. I know cultivating your own shrooms is much cheaper, but idk if I'm quite ready for that yet. So yeah, anyone have any insights? Is it possible to feel this little from 25 grams? Or did I do something wrong?"

Does anyone have any idea of the chances of PT announcing even more festivals, especially in the Netherlands?\n\nI don't know if this is something that can reliably be predicted, so sorry if this thread is useless, but I don't want to get tickets for a festival where PT is the only band I like or a festival all the way in Germany only to find out they're gonna be playing at Lowlands after all."

I remember very clearly that I was watching the SciFi channel and saw a trailer for one of David Tennant's episodes. I had never heard of DW before and it immediately intrigued me and made me want to watch it because of how charismatic and different his character/portrayal was. I don't know if I found out that there wasn't just one doctor before or after I started watching but I do know that the 9th doctor didn't appeal to me at all because he wasn't \"my\" doctor, the reason I started watching at all.\n\nI think I only wached the first episode of season 1, the two parter finale and then the acclaimed episodes such as Dalek and the Empty Child two parter and just flat out skipped the rest because when I was watching with my bf I didn't remember some of the episodes at all. \nHowever, while we watched through the entirety of season one Christopher Eccleston completely won me over. I love his humour as well as his serious, angry side. We're now at the end of season 2 and I noticed that David Tennant's way of portraying the Doctor actually kind of grates on me sometimes now, he's a bit shouty sometimes lol. Though I think he'll still always be my favourite just for being the thing that made me start watching, but 9 is a very close second for now (I stopped watching with 11 lol,  go figure). \n\nAnyway, I just think it's funny how it made me realise how differently and more open minded you look at things when you're older and wanted to share.

His word says we are His children and that we are not slaves to anything (not even sin, feelings, or whatever) anymore. it's hard, but nothing is impossible for Him. if it's hard to believe, ask for faith and He'll answer you ;)",

Of course, I don't want to teach them the English language itself, it would be more like an English teacher in a school or something. Do you think it's possible?

Today, during a lecture, it very suddenly stopped being able to write. The tip no longer seemed to interact with the screen at all. The touchscreen still works with my fingers, and the eraser can still be used, and so can the eraser buttons. So, the Bluetooth connection is still good. It's only the tip that just doesn't work at all. I've tried everything I can find online. I've uninstalled/reinstalled the drivers for the pen. I've re-paired the Bluetooth connection. I've talked to Microsoft's Surface team multiple times with no effect. Seemingly though, other smartpens no longer work on my laptop, which I find odd since the eraser still works (and gives the crosshairs when I hover on that side) on my own pen. My laptop is an HP Envy x360, which I know isn't surface, but I feel like this is the sub to ask because I know many of you may have dealt with this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help would be very much appreciated. I feel like I somehow turned something off, but I have no idea what that could've been, and why it would only not detect the eraser."

So it never shows up as an open wound, it always shows up looking like a wound that's been healing and has already started to scab over. It's always on the back of my left hand, but not in exactly the same spot. It's the only spot where I have seen this happen. There is no hard scab, it's just like new skin or something. It never actually scabs over, but it eventually heals. It itches, but not too bad. It's a little red around the spot. Any ideas?"

It\u2019s been painful to the point of tears doing this and it throbs for 45 minutes. Why the hell did she tell me to do this? I\u2019m seeing people post here about like a gentle irrigation with warm salt water. Did I get shitty advice that\u2019s just making my pain so much worse?

The rap was ; he has come a long way from \"The Grizzly\", lol. The lyrics of course, are basically a flowery way of describing the movie. And I am yet to understand why; I am ready for whatever reason it is, however it ties to him.\n\nIt is definitely not like his early stuff, and at this point, there really should not be *any* reason for me to expect it as such. Seeing things from that lens, I find this a great standalone song. If the focus was less on the fact that it is a song under \"OC\", but that it is a song alone, it is pretty decent. It is different, and very unconventional for an OC song, but it is perfect the way it is.",

I won't be covering all of it, but just the beginning to the first chorus*.\n\n**TL;DR: \"Blue Marlin\" expertly switches from 4/4 to 7/8, before combining the beat of the second with the tempo of the first, to make 7/4.**\n\nThe lead synth fills the first segment alone, soon accompanied by rattling noise that begins to reveal itself in the second segment. This simple drum slowly gets louder to match the lead, remaining at a steady beat of 4/4. It goes like this for a minute, filling the entire sound scape, before suddenly stopping, and fading out, to give breathing room before the next section.\n\nThe suspension is first interrupted by a light cymbal crash, that opens a window into the rest of the percussion. The signature Pacific EP siren lead returns, accompanied by these colorful and *lightly explosive* drums that fill one area of the scape, at a beat of 7/8. It goes on like this for four rounds, but the fourth segment adds a little extra length, using the same suspension method only briefly, to segue into the next segment.\n\nDrums that are even **more explosive** fill the entire space again, now at the tempo of the original section, but with beat of the second, using a signature of 7/4.\n\nI really love this song for all its creativity-- this, alongside \"Salad Basket\", and \"Glass Canada\", shows how competent Adam is at utilizing the more unconventional rhythms."

He had many other \"bird-like\" synths, with Rainbow Veins, Hello Seattle, and Bird And The Worm having the closest resemblance to it. It did not have any exact mimic to anything else he has used so far in his own official stuff, save for the similar sines in the alternate versions of Firebird and All My Friends.\n\nI would also note how he sneakily transitioned from saying \"whoa\", to \"oh\", to \"ooh\", to straight-up \"**hoo**\"-- which are the same effects he has been using in Cinematic, and the collaborations he was in.\n\n*Maybe I am reading a bit too far into it*, but it may be possible that those two sounds were intentional for hinting at an aspect of his new stuff."

She was healthy and then one day she just doesn't want to move, she doesn't have the heavy breathing part but she can't even jump anywhere anymore and she doesn't want to move at all. I took her to bed and she stayed in one position all day but she still drinks but doesn't eat. Does your kitty still drink and/or eat? If they still do at least one of those then they could potentially still survive the night. I xrayed my cat and the vet couldn't find anything weird and could not diagnose what it was. So we IV-ed her instead and have her stay at the vet hospital for 2 nights. I think the IV at least helped her because we took chance on the 3rd night and brought her home, she appeared to have recovered suddenly too!",

I'm a graphic and web designer and I've been working with this startup that wants to provide game developers a platform to upload their games to app stores and part of their unique selling point is the ability for this platform they are offering to basically stick a small icon (relevant to the user's country) on their app preview screenshots (like maybe on the bottom right corner).\n\nWe are at the very beginning of this process. None of them are designers btw and there's only two of us that are \"graphic designers\" but the other one has no experience in UI/UX. Basically, one of my bosses instructed me to just build a graphics library for ALL the countries - no guidelines/creative brief whatsoever, just open creative freedom on what to create as long as relevant to the country assigned and we will figure out which graphic style/which symbols are more relevant to each country when A/B testing comes - that is once we have enough graphics for EACH country (and yes that's for all continents) to test out.\n\nMy question is - is this the right path to begin? I feel like it is extremely overwhelming to ask for localized graphics (not just one but more than 5 graphics) for every country on this planet without any other factors to narrow down designs to make it quicker or am I wrong in thinking this? I want to contest this \"open creative freedom\" process and make them understand that if they want localized graphics, any icon made should 1) have good visibility 2) be easily understood at first glance (like even as simple as the country's flag). Right now, with the progress being made based on the \"open creative freedom\" brief for me is a hit or miss. Some icons are too intricate to visually communicate effectively (especially when it's scaled down too small since it's just a small sticker to be placed somewhere on top of app preview screenshots). Actually, no. I can't even call them icons. They're like mini artworks to be placed on top of screenshots.

I can't focus for more than 5 minutes, it feels like I'm hearing words but I'm not really sure I'm consciously making inferences from it or understanding stuff. Almost zero retention. I solve mcqs and they are mostly based on intuition - like I have a feeling that this may be right but I don't clearly remember the answers word to word. I faced a lot of difficulty in passing my finals in medschool but I cleared with respectable marks so everyone thinks I'm doing fine.\n\nI also tend to forget things here and there, miss out on factual data as from time to time it just feels like I'm staring at numbers with no processing going inside.. and now that I'm in a high stakes environment it's becoming dangerous.. for example I got blank while cannulating a patient.. I couldn't establish IV access so I called my senior for help and then I just blanked out with the needle halfway in whereas I should've been thinking about the solution or finding other veins. I made an error in entering lab results which thankfully my co-intern pointed out. I handed over someone's OPD slip to another patient because I was too absent minded to confirm identity and they were wearing similar clothes.\n\nI have also started experiencing difficulties in talking. I sometimes blank out during conversations, while talking I forget my sentences sometimes, fumble words, I'm thinking \"X killed Y\" in my mind and will say \"Y killed X\"..or forget the words to describe things. There is also some problem in word articulation.. I initially thought that was because my teeth's occlusion wasn't proper and was constantly changing due to (poorly managed) orthodontic treatment. But now I'm worried something is happening to my brain.\n\nPhysically I'm fine.. otherwise healthy..no neurological symptoms.. B12 levels were also fine. I don't drink/smoke/do any drugs. I'm not on any medication. No chronic disease. I'm not very physically active and don't really eat a lot of vegetables so my nutrition is a bit...?\n\nMy mental state is fluctuating. Right now it's fine because I'm in denial of my responsibilities and course-load even when I should be worried af. But since March-April 2021 I was extremely depressed. Couldn't seek any therapy because I didn't have time due to back to back exams in the final year of medschool. I have had borderline score on Beck's questionnaire for depression at one point. No suicidal thoughts, but hopelessness and an apathy towards daily life is there. \n\nSo I don't really know what's happening with me right now. Is it just me overreacting and all I should do is to stop cribbing and start studying? Because I don't think all this makes any sense and the psychiatrist would just think I'm making all this up..?

A bunch of personal stuff, writing feels therapeutic to me, so feel free to skip reading.\n\nI have a habit of having conversations in my head with people. All.the.time. I grew up as an only child, extremely shy and introverted, with no kids to play with, so most of my time was spent with books, and in my head, conjuring up scenarios and conversations with people. I'd be sitting in my room imagining going on walks with my crush, spinning conversations, and quite like Fleabag, commenting on the life around me to 'me' (it's probably my alter ego- there's a responsible me that I refer to with my real name and then there's me, this goal-less, fumbling, awkward person longing for love and company that I like to refer with my nickname). \n\nI grew up in a religious family, and I believe in God, but it's weird- I address Them a lot like Fleabag addresses her audience. When Fleabag said \"He's an understanding sort\", I just went Yes! Exactly! like the Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at the TV meme. I have faith, it feels fulfilling to participate in rituals and ceremonies, but I'm not hyper-religious. I loved the way faith and belief was discussed in the show, with candor, understanding and without any condescending preaching.\n\nI never really gave much thought to this habit of having conversations before this show. So a few minutes into this show, I slowly realised- Wait a minute- other people do this too? Seeing someone like me on screen for the first time felt.. different. And then came the scene with the therapist. For the first time I realised this was a. Not normal, b. A coping mechanism, c. An unhealthy coping mechanism, something that needs to be addressed. So this show made me realise I needed to go see a therapist and deal with my stuff.\n\nLove. I have always longed for it. It's a clingy, creepy, cringe thing to admit openly, but yeah, I long to be loved and to love someone. The Priest's wedding speech- oh, *chef's kiss* . By the end of the show, I was sobbing like crazy- because it struck so many chords and insecurities of mine. Someone as broken as Fleabag found love, and that love was reciprocated, the Priest truly loved her, despite all her flaws, and saw through her, through the front she was putting up for everyone. I was so happy for her.. but at the same time I was crushed- they had to part?! Finally finding happiness, only to be taken away- finding love, but not getting to be together..\n\nOther themes that I love in the show are that the Priest chose faith because he was struggling with addiction and family matters and meaningless relationships and even though he found love, he had to do the right thing and part, for improving himself and feeling true to himself. Fleabag and Claire's relationship was as realistic as sisters could be \"we're not friends, we're sisters\" \"I'll run through an airport for you\". The awkwardness of Fleabag's Dad is something I relate with, given my inability to articulate any of my feelings.\n\n\"Buck up.. smile.. charm.. off we go. We'll be okay.\" \n\nI hope that one day I'll be able to wave goodbye to my audience too. But life would be so bland without an internal monologue, no? Till then I'll keep re-watching the show and living vicariously."

I'm literally feeling so fcking dumb I was sitting there like an idiot who doesn't know a thing about labour whereas I spent the whole night tirelessly mugging every topic in obstetrics except the one part I was questioned on. I had the answers of almost all questions that were asked to others because I had read those topics but I left the one portion I was quizzed on. And in the panic that ensued I mixed up even those things that I already knew. And now the head professor of my department thinks I'm a dumb failure. Even the topics I read I mix them up in the exams I can't retain numerical values and I mix up the management algorithms. Instead I waste whole of my time obsessing over emotions, people, daydreaming about the future, looking back at the past I just can't get a grip on my present and in that process I'm ruining my future. I want to stop obsessing over people and emotions and trivial materialistic stuff I just want to forget everything else and just fcking study and give one exam where I'm not grasping at straws for survival and feeling like my brain has turned to mush. I just want to study and forget about everything. Help me please, please."

The one respite I get from all of this is that I\u2019m sure he\u2019s *just* self aware enough to know there\u2019s something deeply wrong with him leading to some pretty intense self loathing. Obviously his inflated narcissistic ego keeps making sure he\u2019ll always truly believe his life is unfair, he\u2019ll use other\u2019s empathy to feel better about himself, and he\u2019s of course the smartest, the most cunning, he doesn\u2019t deserve all the bullshit he brought on himself etc. You know the gist. I quote, from a conversation where I tried to ask him to reconsider a point: \u201cOP, I am very very very smart, when I have an intuition it\u2019s usually right\u201d. The nerves. \n\nDespite all of this, it fucking sucks. Knowing that no matter what you do, no matter how you approach him, you\u2019ll always have to be the one to do the efforts and adapt to his stubborn and sick behavior. That he\u2019ll never put in any efforts. Knowing that my brother and I had to become the adults very quickly and that our dad will always believe he\u2019s right. Knowing that a normal conversation is impossible and can even turn dangerous/violent! What the fuck? His little tantrums are exhausting.  Now I\u2019m gone though, and I\u2019ll make sure he never sees or hear from me again. \n\nWhat\u2019s the point? Except to make HIM feel good about himself, considering every interaction we have I have to be the one to pretend there\u2019s nothing wrong. I\u2019ve been told I should honor his investment in me, and at least keep minimal contact. A hello there, a happy birthday here. Fuck that, fuck having to always make peace and be the bigger person. I am DONE putting myself down for this emotionally constipated child. \n\nI hate narcissists so much, they\u2019re a plague to this world, sick people who only exist to destroy others and I feel nothing but pity and disgust for them. How awful is it to live life always thinking someone is out to get you? Incapable of personal growth, of building true meaningful connections? These people are mistakes and emotional vampires who pray on people\u2019s wonderful life force of empathy because they themselves can\u2019t feel anything. Parasites. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t always \u201cbad\u201d with him; Posts here make me realize I was lucky. Yes, he\u2019s always been mentally and physically abusive, but I was also the projection of his narcissism and became his tool of pride. He destroyed my sense of self, ignored my little brother who has little to no meaningful links with him, but also made me believe he was just eccentric and was doing his best for us. We were \u201cclose\u201d, I would see him as my role model, so proud he\u2019d even see potential in me, never wanting to let him down, and he fucking loved it. I was his little toy to parade around, incapable of taking a decision for myself without second, third guessing (What would dad think? No I can\u2019t do this, he told me it\u2019s stupid, he obviously knows best). He sucked my joy dry, made my amazing, strong and resilient mother constantly walk on eggshells, and never showed my little brother the love he deserved. \n\nThis is why, no matter what people say, I\u2019m done. There is no closure with people like them, not in the sense where you\u2019ll finally get a point accross, you know? Make them realize they fucked up. So let him think I\u2019m too emotional, let him think it\u2019s \u201cnormal for my age\u201d to stick close to my mother, let him think I\u2019m incapable of thinking on my own and I\u2019m just going through a phase. He\u2019ll never see me again, I\u2019m finally free and no matter what will always be a better person because unlike him, I want to keep growing, make mistakes, and become the best person I can be. \n\nSee you never dad. Enjoy self sabotaging yourself more. \n\nAlso that was very cathartic gosh"

Our neighborhood is a cat-dumping ground and I regularly help these abandoned cats find homes and get fixed. I set out food and the next day the orange tabby joined. They couldn't have been older than six weeks and were very cautious around humans. I managed to catch them and lock them in my laundry room. Two months later, I've never seen such a happier couple of kittens in my life. They're still a little shy, but they're safe, warm, dry, and content.

Try searching for some lye master batching YouTube videos if you're interested in that but I waited until I made about five batches before I did that myself.\n\nThe other advice I'd give you as a newbie myself is don't even use your stick blender to start. Mix it with a whisk. You'll feel it start to emulsify and reach trace and it will do so at a much slower rate so that you can learn when to stop. Especially if you're working with small batches of under 800g of oil, you don't even need a stick blender. I've only ever used my stick blender for one really big batch.",

Play on x6 if you can guarantee a full combo or SS score, and when you run out of energy, grind on x0 to earn points.\n\n**Missions (for gemsssss)**\n\n10 Gem Missions\n\n* Play Division Rap Battle with Jiro in your team x1\n* Play Ikebukuro West Game Park with Saburo in your team x1\n* Play Alternative Rap Battle with Gentarou in your team x1\n* Play Shibuya Marble Texture with Dice in your team x1\n\n25 Gem Missions\n\n* Play Ikebukuro West Game Park at normal or higher with Jiro in your team x3\n* Play Division Rap Battle at normal or higher with Saburo in your team x3\n* Play Shibuya Marble Texture at normal or higher with Gentarou in your team x3\n* Play Alternative Rap Battle at normal or higher with Dice in your team x3\n\n50 Gem Missions (No Autoplay!)\n\n* Play Alternative Rap Battle with Jiro, and earn a score over 240,000 x5\n* Play Ikebukuro West Game Park with Saburo, and earn a score over 140,000 x5\n* Play Division Rap Battle with Gentarou, and earn a score over 210,000 x5\n* Play Shibuya Marble Texture with Dice, and earn a score over 150,000 x5\n\n65 Gem Missions (No Autoplay!)\n\n* Play Ikebukuro West Game Park with Jiro, on Hard or higher, and earn a combo of 400+, x10\n* Play Alternative Rap Battle with Saburo, on Hard or higher, and earn a combo of 340+, x10\n* Play Shibuya Marble Texture with Gentarou, on Hard or higher, and earn a combo of 400+, x10\n* Play Division Rap Battle with Dice, on Hard or higher, and earn a combo of 360+, x10  \n\n\n**Points**\n\nFrom songs, you earn points, which like the last event gradually build over time and give you rewards when you reach milestones. ARB on hard is averaging about 260-300 points depending on the score. Notable milestones to reach are:\n\n* Event Scenario Tickets - 2nd @ 4,620, 3rd @ 9,540, 4th @ 15,640\n* Golden Trading Ticket - 30,000\n* Harps, 120 pcs, at various increments\n* Iron Claws, 80 pcs, at various increments\n* Lots of EXP stickers\n* Lots of Suit coins to trade\n* From 30,000 points up Harps are at 450 pcs and Claws are at 300 pcs, every 2,500 points.\n\nThe highest milestone is 210,000 - basically, on Hard play between 700-850 times. Don't know about Expert, but if someone could tell me the number of points you earn from hitting S or SS on an Expert song, I'd be super grateful.\n\n**Items**\n\nThere are 4 items you can earn from songs, but 2 more items that you can trade in for.\n\n**Potions!** Earned from songs. Can be traded for:\n\n* 100 for EXP Small Stickers - unlimited\n* 10:1 or 1000:100 for Harps, Iron Claws and Dragon Claws - unlimited\n\n**Harps!** Earned from potions, songs and point milestones. Can be traded for:\n\n* 50:1 Tarot Cards - unlimited\n* 100:1 Magic Staff - unlimited\n* Gold and Silver Badges for evolving\n   * Gold Free Badge - 525 (x9) or 735 (x18)\n   * Gold Spade Badge - 980 (x27)\n   * Gold Heart Badge - 700 (x27)\n   * Silver Free Badge - 295 (x9) or 415 (x9)\n   * Silver Diamond Badge - 395 (x27)\n   * Silver Club Badge - 550 (x27)\n\n**Iron Claws (IC)!** Earned from potions, songs and point milestones.

Can be traded for:\n\n* EXP Sticker M - 3 (unlimited)\n* **SR Gentarou (Liar Liar ver.) - 50 (x1), 75 (x1), 100 (x1)** \\- (basically you need 2,500 total of H, IC, and DC; or 250,000 potions for 1, but a combination of the two means its easily attainable.)\n\n**Magic Staff!** Earned from trading and songs, but rare. Can be traded for:\n\n* EXP Sticker Spade/Heart/Diamond/Club - 5 (unlimited)\n* Skill Medals Ikebukuro / Shibuya - 10 (x30)\n* **SSR Sabura (Hellfire Mage that turns all living things to ash and dust ver.) - 300 (x1), 345 (x1)** \\- (basically you need 5,000 total of H, IC, and DC; or 500,000 potions for 1, but again a combination of the two means it's not impossible.)\n\nGood Luck with the event!"

                "created_utc": 1586999547.0,
                "body": "Dunno if there is a guide up yet anywhere, but this event has way more layers than the BB vs FP event, so I wrote down notes for myself and figured I'd share them. I've also never played a rhythm game like this before so some of my notes might be obvious to you cause it's the norm, but everything is new to me. I hope this helps someone! :D\n\n**Tips**\n\nMake an MTC team that has at least one of each character, preferably those with BLUE outlines or spades, but SRs and SSRs are preferably over that. Use this team to play Yokohama Walker.\n\nMake a Matenrou team that has at least one of each character, preferably with GREEN outlines or clovers, but again, SRs and SSRs will net more points. Use this team to play Warawasuna Shinjuku Style.\n\nWhen choosing a supporting character, if you don't have the option to use one that boosts the event points by 50%, keeping picking a random character to go to the setup screen, and then go back. Repeat until you've got the option to choose one, and no matter what support they give, use them because its a guarunteed 50% boost to items/points. If possible though, it's better to choose a character who is from the same group as members on your team, because, for example, the event Juuto support effect is to boost Samatoki, Juuto and Rio's lyric points by 45%.\n\n**Event Missions**\n\nAll these missions get you EXP stickers of various symbols.\n\nPlay Yokohama Walker 3x(?) with Samatoki, Juuto and Rio each at Normal or above. (Hence putting them on the same team will help get all three of these missions done at the same time. I think it's 3 but I finished it already so can't remember.)\n\nPlay Yokohama Walker 5x with Samatoki Juuto and Rio, getting a score of 17,000 with no autoplay. (Possible on Normal level. This will likely go up to 10 once you finish the 5x, but the score might also get higher. **It did not go to 10, only 5 times.**)\n\nPlay Yokohama Walker 10x with Samatoki, Juuto and Rio, getting a combo of 300 or higher with no autoplay. (This will only be possible by playing on HARD. Normal only goes up to 263 combos, hard is about 388.)\n\nRepeat with Shinjuku and Warawasuna Shinjuku Style.\n\n**Rewards**\n\nWhen you play the even songs, Yokohama Walker and Warawasuna Shinjuku Style, you earn points just like with BB vs FP, but the total of which will give you items as you reach different goals. You don't spend these points like the last event, they just accumulate. The final goal is 86,200 points. Items include normal shop coins, EXP stickers of varying sizes, a TRADE TICKET at 25,000 points!!, and then Gold Feature M coins from that point on.\n\nPlaying on Normal with a perfect combo earned me roughly 230-250 points, so playing 4 times gets close to 1000 points. THESE POINTS **DO NOT** GET BOOSTED by playing 2x or 6x.\n\nYou also earn items you can trade; Bottle Ships, and silver or gold Feature M coins depending on the difficulty level. I have only earned silver coins by playing on Normal, cause eff YW on hard. \n\nThese ARE boosted by 2x and 6x play.\n\n**edit added here**\n\nHOWEVER, along with all this, you can continue to earn points even when playing x0. BUT You do not get items at 0x play. So if you can definitely get a full combo, I recommend playing x2 or x6 for bonus items. It will probably be beneficial in the long run.\n\nOn Yokohama Walker, Normal, 1x play, full combo, I earned about 260~320 Golden bottles and 25 silver coins. I'm assuming you can earn gold coins from playing on hard or expert. 2x play got me double + 240 extra bottle ships for full combo.\n\n**Bottles Ships**\n\nYou can exchange\n\n10 Bottles for 1 Silver Coin.\n\n1000 Bottles for 100 Silver Coins.\n\n100 Bottles for Small Exp Stickers.\n\n**Silver Feature M Coins**\n\nYou can exchange\n\n10 SC for 1 Gold Coin.\n\n100 SC for Medium Exp Stickers\n\n500 SC for Silver Character Symbol (limit 2)\n\n550 SC for Silver Symbol Badges (limit 27)\n\n420 SC for Silver Badges (limit 18)\n\n2000 SC for a Single Pull G Collect Ticket (limit 10)\n\n**Gold Feature M Coins**\n\nYou can exchange\n\n15 GC for Gold Badges (limit 18)\n\n18 GC for Gold Symbol Badges (limit 27)\n\n20 GC for Gold Character Symbol (limit 2)\n\n10 GC for Large Exp Stickers"

It had to do with how they treated a recent dividend payment.  It was paid to my account on the first of July....then was transferred to my FDIC cash account...and then....because I have automatic dividend reinvestment (DRIP) set up, they removed it from my cash account to reinvest.  Because of the way they have their website set up, this \"removal\" from my cash account gets counted as a \"loss\", temporarily....at least to the degree that it affects my \"day gain/loss value\".  So in this case, my positions were showing that I gained $43.85 on Wednesday (which I did), but under my \"account value\" it showed a gain of only $12.48....because the $31.37 that was in the process of getting reinvested was counted against my overall account gains for the day.  It's a bad website design that leads to confusion.  The guy that finally figured out what was going on said he wished it wasn't set up that way.  Maybe your issue is due to something similar?  The only way to find out is to call them and ask them to look into it and then explain it to you.",

The rentability is covered.  Connecting this \"accessory dwelling unit\" to the house qualifies it and the main house as one residence, in which I can have up to 4 unrelated individuals residing....which means I could rent the space.  Yes, it was very complicated coming up with a plan that would accomplish what I wanted that would pass muster with the planning dept., but they have given me their \"pre-approval\" and even registered it (before it's actually been built)\n\nI made it clear to architect that I just wanted clear drawings so that I could more easily compare bids from contractors..and which the contractors could work from...So this estimate doesn't include any permitting, bidding, construction contract review and negotiation, construction observation, review of contractor RFIs and Submittals, certification of contractor payment requests, lien releases or close out. \n\nI believe it is their standard practice to run their plans by an engineer to ensure structural viability...especially if there's anything included that even the building codes dept. might not be able to clearly determine is \"sound\" by the way the code reads....(which there may be in this case....The storage area above 1/2 of the kitchen in which I want a window installed in a 3' high wall)\n\nI was told that they bill by the hour, and I'm obviously wanting to make this easy for them so that it will save me money.

I panicked lol, restarted the game hoping it didn\u2019t save it as she\u2019s my babes as I mentioned. I don\u2019t wanna kill her.\n\nWhen I reloaded I could no longer speak with her in the ruins but she was still there and moving so clearly I didn\u2019t kill her\u2026 strange? Then I went back to where she is usually (Waypoint Ruins Cellar) and she wasn\u2019t there. Again confusing as that version of her is supposed to be a projection right?\n\nLong story short have I broken the game? Have I pissed off Sellen and she\u2019s ignoring me? Lol. I miss her and need her to teach me some more spells."

I was born in 1993 so although I did grow up with social media and smart phones to an extent, it is in no way comparable to someone born after ~2005.\n\nPeople are now growing up during a time where smart phones can take, and hold, a huge amount of photos and videos. Also social media can hold an infinite amount of memories from birth onwards. As well as this, people are more likely than ever to take photos and record moments due to the ease of being able to just use your smart phone. Only 20-30 years ago photos would have to be taken to be processed and printed.\n\nPersonally, my childhood memories seem very limited in quantity, although reasonably vivid. Is there any evidence that this does or may lead to people remembering more of their childhood due to so much of it being recorded compared to someone my age who has less photos and in particular videos to look back on?"

I tend to not wear my cochlear implants in the morning, so I can save battery life for when I\u2019m at work.\n\nI wake up at 4:00-4:30 every morning because I work far from home. Apparently I make a lot of noise when I\u2019m not aware of it (duh).  I have a roommate who moved in a few months ago who is a light sleeper, and she has asked me to be more aware of the noises I make and to be quieter when I\u2019m moving stuff around in the kitchen.\n\nFor some reason this bothers me.  Of course I accommodated her so I could be a good person and roommate, but growing up culturally Deaf, many people in my social circle never made an issue of my being unable to hear or whether I made noise.\n\nFirst she once came out of her room to tell me to lower the noise, and even though my cochlear implants were off I knew that\u2019s what she was telling me about.  We\u2019ve kept discussing ways I can make less noise since then.  I bought wooden stirrers for coffee, then she bought wooden cutlery, both of which weren\u2019t a problem.  But the other day we both agreed that I would wear my cochlear implants so I could pay attention to what specific noises I might have made.  It\u2019s wearing the cochlear implants in the morning that bothers me for some reason.\n\nI want to be a good roommate and friend, but I feel mean for wanting to just have silence in the mornings and not have to worry about noise (at least on my end).\n\nAnyone else have a similar experience living with hearing people who tell them to be quieter?\n\n\nEdit: thanks for all the feedback.  Will try some of the strategies mentioned in your comments."

The French military first used piloted balloons for surveillance in the Franco-Austrian war in 1859, and spy balloons were commonly used in both World War I and II. And while satellites now are the go-to platform for gathering intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), balloons still have a niche role, and in fact can do some things better than satellites.  \n\u201cAs far as the intelligence value of balloons over satellites, there is indeed some value. Balloons and high altitude aircraft can image things from a much closer distance and can dwell over an area for a longer time than low Earth orbiting satellites (which are typically gone in a couple of minutes),\u201d explained Brian Weeden. To cover a single area consistently, a nation would need at least a small constellation of satellites all taking turns as they fly by.  \nRuth Stilwell, executive director of Aerospace Policy Solutions LLC and an expert on integrated space and aviation policy, told Breaking Defense that because balloons are frequently used for civil sensing missions, such as weather, spy balloons can sort of hide in plain sight.  \n\u201cThere\u2019s actually quite a lot of sensing balloons \u2026 and so they\u2019re often perceived as non-threatening. The first assumption wouldn\u2019t be that they are weapons,\u201d she said.  \n\u201cBut the main thing is, compared to a satellite they\u2019re cheap to deploy,\u201d Stilwell, who worked as a US air traffic controller for 25 years, stressed. \u201cThey\u2019re expendable.\u201d  \nAnd it seems the high-flying balloons can slip through what US Northern Command chief Gen. Glen VanHerck called a \u201cdomain awareness gap\u201d in US defenses. Today former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told CNN that the military is good at tracking objects under around 50,000 feet and in space, but apparently not as good in the \u201cgray area\u201d between the two.",

I got a BFN there- 3pm at 9 dpo, so I wasn't surprised it was a BFN. Went immediately to the drug store & got a couple more tests (a generic and clear blue, the first was FRER & I don't know what kind PP uses). Symptoms: very sore breasts that began 7 dpo, and the same feeling I had with my first- which is why I tested at all. \n\nMorning of 10 dpo another BFP with 2nd FRER, but I will grant the line was lighter than 9dpo. (both definitely pink & definitely w/in 3mins) Boobs are still sore and I'm TIRED.  I feel asleep early, but something on the TV woke me up around 10pm & I went to the bathroom and I'd started my period? But not, cus it was light and brown - even my bf looked at it and was like haha no that's implantation bleeding, too light for you and its brown. \n\nMorning of 11 dpo I used clear blue RR and another BFP & the blue was darker than 10dpo (and definitely blue & w/in the time frame). I'm still bleeding, but it's still WAY less than a normal period and my expected period is still 4 days away. I need to clarify, I am normally an extremely heavy flow, I will use a super+ in 30 mins on my heaviest day; this flow was like spotting for me, it wasn't constant, never filled a panty liner (not even close) and no clots. Was still very tired so, slept most of the day & still went to bed at around 9 pm. \n\nIt is now morning of 12 dpo and I peed on the clear blue digital and BFN. Still bleeding, but it's gotten even lighter since yesterday and still no clots. Breast are still sore & dinner smelled disgusting last night half way through. Still very tired, and very confused. Wanted to rant/vent cus idk what else I can do. \n\nI have strips coming on Tuesday & hoping the bleeding fully stops today.\n\nEDIT: Am I nuts??? I just opened the digital test, cus it didn't sit right with me & there's clearly two BRIGHT blue lines on the strip! Did clear blue digital give out a bad reading? Wth is going on"

It's completely inline with other 9dpo true positive results from First Response.   \n\n\nI called my OBGYN and they won't see me until end of August, so I've got a blood test at PP today (ironically with the SAME gyno that helped with my BC switch \\*awkward laugh) and hoping to get some more definitive answers!   \n\n\nWe are nervous and excited!"

They have no sense of imagination, ethics, or social functioning, they just do whatever they need to do to survive. Now, I don\u2019t know if this applies to all sensors, but ISTPs are basically boiled down to having simple lizard brains. Everything they think about, do, and say is no more complex than the average goldfish. I think that a lot of money can be made to keep theme in zoos and let keep get educated on their species.\n\n(Just trolling. Y\u2019all are great.)"

(Forbclarification, with artificial insemination, since we obviously can\u2019t have sex. We considered having an ESTP cuck me, but we wanted the baby\u2019s IQ to be at least 160.) Last Tuesday, after getting an ultrasound, the ENTJ doctor told us that we could actually determine the baby\u2019s MBTI type before their brain was even fully formed, and that we could do it right there and for a few extra thousand dollars. Naturally, we readily agreed. We both expected them to be apart of the master race, being an INFJ, INFP, INTJ, or INTP, and we were hoping for an INTJ. As it turns out... The baby will be an ISTJ... My wife immediately vomited and hasn\u2019t spoken since then. My Fi and Te have been wrestling with this for days, and they both tell me to get an abortion. I believe that life is precious, but I just don\u2019t know if I can accept a sensor in my family. What do you think I should do"

Although wild boars live in the wild, they can be easily distinguished from domestic pigs because wild boars usually have darker skin. Depending on the region, wild boars are usually black, brown, dark gray or red in color.\n\nWild boars (also domestic pigs) are **omnivores**, eating primarily plant material such as nuts, fruits, and tubers. However, their domesticated relatives have a balanced and varied diet that may contain corn, wheat, and other vegetable-based foods and supplements to help them grow bigger and heavier.\n\nDomestic pigs, like most mammals, have two sets of teeth:\n\nBecause of this, they are called **diphyodonts** (teeth erupt twice during life).\n\n1. Primary, variable, temporary or deciduous set of teeth. This set of teeth consists of 32 teeth and its formula is **2(Di 3/3 Dc 1/1 Dp 4/4).**\n2. Secondary, permanent, final or replacement set of teeth. It consists of 44 teeth - the teeth formula is **2(I3/3 C1/1 P4/4 M3/3).**\n\nPigs are born with eight teeth: milk upper third incisors and canines. These teeth almost protrude from the gums and can injure the udder of the sow or litter mates. For this reason, they are usually cut within the first 2-6 hours after birth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hydrogen peroxide: how and why did it whiten the bone fragment, and generally, how does it work?\n\nHydrogen peroxide is water (H\u2082O) with an extra molecule of oxygen (H\u2082O\u2082). The extra oxygen molecule oxidizes, and that's how the peroxide gets its power. This oxidation kills bacteria and fades color from porous surfaces such as fabrics.\n\nIt is unstable and breaks down into water and oxygen over time.\n\nHydrogen peroxide is an active bleaching agent - when it breaks down, it **produces an oxygen molecule with an unpaired electron: that is called a free radical; it actively reacts with substances**: it oxidizes chromophores, taking electrons that hold atoms together - causing the molecule that gives a substance color - to break down.\n\nChromophore \u2013 a group of atoms that determines the color of an organic chemical compound.\n\nH\u2082O\u2082 is a weak acid with strong oxidizing properties. The impact and friction-sensitive explosives triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and diacetone diperoxide (DADP) are known to form when concentrated H\u2082O\u2082 and acetone are mixed, and acid is used as a catalyst.\n\nMany minerals, especially manganese oxides, catalyze the decomposition of H\u2082O\u2082. The oxygen is in the bubbles that appear when the H\u2082O\u2082 breaks down.\n\nH\u2082O\u2082 doesn't react with rocks, so it doesn't clean anything, at least chemically, except that the bubbling can help push soil out of cracks in the rock.\n\nOn the other hand, **regular** H\u2082O\u2082 contact with bones can damage the collagen in their organic phase in the **long term**.\n\nThe H\u2082O\u2082 radical oxidizes and/or mechanically pushes the color-inducing molecules from the bones, bleaching them, making them more fragile, because the collagen that can be damaged by H\u2082O\u2082 is in combination with the calcium minerals in the bones, the collagen gives the bones strength and a certain elasticity - by greatly reducing its amount in the bones, they become very crumbly and fragile.\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\n**Translations of the text on the platform (top to down)**\n\nJaw fragment from a domestic pig (Sus domesticus)\n\nBleached in 3% H\u2082O\u2082 \\[2 weeks\\]\n\n\\[Found\\] 33 cm deep in soil\n\n\\[It was\\] A young specimen - teeth were still growing\n\nSkull \\[vertically parallel word to the [image of a domestic pig skull](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Domestic_pig_skull_%28MAV%29.jpg)\\]\n\nIn total adults \\[pigs\\] have 44 teeth: 12 incisors, 4 canines, 16 premolars, 12 molars\n\n\\[Arrow pointing towards [image of the jaw fragment after excavation](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonecollecting/comments/yu6gd9/is_this_jaw_fragment_from_a_pig_if_no_then_from/)\\] Before whitening (color due to mineralization)\n\n\\[Vertical text next to large image of domestic pig dentition\\] Sus domesticus lower jaw dentition\n\n\\------------\n\n[The image of a domestic pig jaw](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Domestic_pig_jaw.jpg) on which I described the dentition\n\n[Translated version of the dentition image](https://imgur.com/gallery/EGcJO6v)",

Some things held me back from doing that, the first being the fact that the [maceration](https://preview.redd.it/oezgkndgu5x91.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0fb6d0c916029532f23d36252f8091658744b147) required for getting rid of the remaining soft tissue on the bones takes a lot of time, in my case it took at least 1.5 months.\n\nShould have changed that water earlier, the bones are now sitting in the same water since 31st Oct 2022. There is quite a bit of white tissue floating at the bottom of the plastic container, the bones look very clean, and the cervical spine vertebrae have separated. So probably changing the water would only slow the process, by interfering with the bacteria. Anyways I missed the date so I didn't want to open the container as it would smell horrible.\n\nI will post an update soon, it will be the second one. The bones have become a jigsaw puzzle. Teeth have fallen out, the mandible has been separated into two parts, [the interparietal bone](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rattus_macleari_skull_labeled.svg) has separated from the skull, etc. It's a mess, putting all of that back together will be fun.\n\nThe other reason I wasn't able to finish the vole skull project: I was working on my pine nut projects non-stop for the 2 winter break weeks that were given to me (did procrastinate). Here is the list of the projects I was finishing from 23rd Dec 2022 to 9th Jan 2023, if curious:\n\n* [PN\u20132 Pole in Action & my 2022 Pine Nut Season | Foraging Pine Nuts](https://youtu.be/wn4W-0_F7rc)\n* [My 2022 Pine Nut Season & Related Achievement Recap](https://youtu.be/ltzmrgWLNYU)\n* [PN-2 pole; an assemblable, inexpensive, durable aluminum pole for pine nut (pine cone) harvesting \\[one of the Reddit posts\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/foraging/comments/101fmmk/i_16m_made_a_pole_for_pine_nut_pine_cone/)\n* [r/DIY Imgur guide for PN-2 pole](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/101abps/pn2_pole_an_assemblable_inexpensive_durable/)\n* [DIY project: PN-2 pole; an assemblable, inexpensive, durable aluminum pole for pine nut (pine cone) harvesting \\[Imgur\\]](https://imgur.com/gallery/J0qGgRF)\n* [Media of 2022 pine nut season](https://www.flickr.com/photos/195801793@N08/albums)\n\nAnd I kind of robbed myself of holidays, this was probably the first time the new year came and I wasn't ready for it. Frankly, I didn't have any fun in terms of celebrating holidays whatsoever, but projects weren't the entire reason for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn case you didn't notice, the largest tooth (which is still a premolar as it has 3 roots, but more root canals) has a pale cyan patch on it. It appeared after whitening. I also accidentally crushed the part of the jaw where the smaller tooth is located, it was superglued to the jaw fragment, you can see the glue seam in the photos if you look closely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**-FYI-** Projects that I will donate to my school:\n\nOngoing:\n\n* Vole (*Microtus* \\[*unknown exact species*\\]) skull & cervical spine on a plywood black platform with a paper superficially describing vole species in Latvia; **current deadline April**\n\nEnvisioned projects I will put more effort into, and I will try my best to make them until the end of HS:\n\n* Plywood platform with a Korean pine (*Pinus koraiensis*) cone, foliage, bark, seeds (shelled vs unshelled), and description of Korean pine with a focus on it as a pine nut tree, GM potential - how to enhance plants, including pine nut trees; I will need a **freshly harvested and correctly dried cone** for that, so I have to wait for the next 15th September to come - or even better, harvesting with a pole on 1st Sep might get me a flawless cone.\n* Plywood platform with a Siberian pine (*Pinus sibirica*) cone, foliage, bark, seeds (shelled vs unshelled), and description of Siberian pine with a focus on it as a pine nut tree, hybridization potential with *Pinus cembra*, developing resistance towards pine cone and shoot moth ([*Dioryctria abietella*](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/comments/yfnqz8/i_keep_on_finding_these_menacing_coneeating_worms/)) larva with genetic engineering; waiting for a fresh cone - expected July 2023\n* Plywood platform with a Swiss pine (*Pinus cembra*) cone, foliage, bark, seeds (shelled vs unshelled), and description of Swiss pine with a focus on it as a pine nut tree, how to enhance the Swiss pine, developing resistance towards pine cone and shoot moth ([*Dioryctria abietella*](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/comments/yfnqz8/i_keep_on_finding_these_menacing_coneeating_worms/)) larva with genetic engineering; waiting for a fresh cone - expected August 2023\n* Smaller plywood platform with a Siberian dwarf pine (*Pinus pumila*) cone, foliage, bark, seeds (shelled vs unshelled), and description of Swiss pine with a focus on it as a pine nut tree, how to enhance the Siberian dwarf pine, [hybridization of P. pumila with P. sibirica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_pumila_%C3%97_P._sibirica); waiting for a fresh cone - expected July 2023\n* I will probably add some of my related actions to these platforms, and add a separate paper to one of them\n\nThese platforms can take up space, and space is limited, so I will probably have to combine them or make platforms for 2 or 1 species only. And probably I won't have as much space or knowledge to meaningfully discuss additional topics on the paper. I will learn & understand these species deeper.\n\nI have a jigsaw, PVA and sandpaper, now only have to learn how to drive screws, and then I am ready for making decent platforms. Cheers",

Although wild boars live in the wild, they can be easily distinguished from domestic pigs because wild boars usually have darker skin. Depending on the region, wild boars are usually black, brown, dark gray or red in color.\n\nWild boars (also domestic pigs) are **omnivores**, eating primarily plant material such as nuts, fruits, and tubers. However, their domesticated relatives have a balanced and varied diet that may contain corn, wheat, and other vegetable-based foods and supplements to help them grow bigger and heavier.\n\nDomestic pigs, like most mammals, have two sets of teeth:\n\nBecause of this, they are called **diphyodonts** (teeth erupt twice during life).\n\n1. Primary, variable, temporary or deciduous set of teeth. This set of teeth consists of 32 teeth and its formula is **2(Di 3/3 Dc 1/1 Dp 4/4).**\n2. Secondary, permanent, final or replacement set of teeth. It consists of 44 teeth - the teeth formula is **2(I3/3 C1/1 P4/4 M3/3).**\n\nPigs are born with eight teeth: milk upper third incisors and canines. These teeth almost protrude from the gums and can injure the udder of the sow or litter mates. For this reason, they are usually cut within the first 2-6 hours after birth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hydrogen peroxide: how and why did it whiten the bone fragment, and generally, how does it work?\n\nHydrogen peroxide is water (H\u2082O) with an extra molecule of oxygen (H\u2082O\u2082). The extra oxygen molecule oxidizes, and that's how the peroxide gets its power. This oxidation kills bacteria and fades color from porous surfaces such as fabrics.\n\nIt is unstable and breaks down into water and oxygen over time.\n\nHydrogen peroxide is an active bleaching agent - when it breaks down, it **produces an oxygen molecule with an unpaired electron: that is called a free radical; it actively reacts with substances**: it oxidizes chromophores, taking electrons that hold atoms together - causing the molecule that gives a substance color - to break down.\n\nChromophore \u2013 a group of atoms that determines the color of an organic chemical compound.\n\nH\u2082O\u2082 is a weak acid with strong oxidizing properties. The impact and friction-sensitive explosives triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and diacetone diperoxide (DADP) are known to form when concentrated H\u2082O\u2082 and acetone are mixed, and acid is used as a catalyst.\n\nMany minerals, especially manganese oxides, catalyze the decomposition of H\u2082O\u2082. The oxygen is in the bubbles that appear when the H\u2082O\u2082 breaks down.\n\nH\u2082O\u2082 doesn't react with rocks, so it doesn't clean anything, at least chemically, except that the bubbling can help push soil out of cracks in the rock.\n\nOn the other hand, **regular** H\u2082O\u2082 contact with bones can damage the collagen in their organic phase in the **long term**.\n\nThe H\u2082O\u2082 radical oxidizes and/or mechanically pushes the color-inducing molecules from the bones, bleaching them, making them more fragile, because the collagen that can be damaged by H\u2082O\u2082 is in combination with the calcium minerals in the bones, the collagen gives the bones strength and a certain elasticity - by greatly reducing its amount in the bones, they become very crumbly and fragile.\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\n**Translations of the text on the platform (top to down)**\n\nJaw fragment from a domestic pig (Sus domesticus)\n\nBleached in 3% H\u2082O\u2082 \\[2 weeks\\]\n\n\\[Found\\] 33 cm deep in soil\n\n\\[It was\\] A young specimen - teeth were still growing\n\nSkull \\[vertically parallel word to the [image of a domestic pig skull](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Domestic_pig_skull_%28MAV%29.jpg)\\]\n\nIn total adults \\[pigs\\] have 44 teeth: 12 incisors, 4 canines, 16 premolars, 12 molars\n\n\\[Arrow pointing towards [image of the jaw fragment after excavation](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonecollecting/comments/yu6gd9/is_this_jaw_fragment_from_a_pig_if_no_then_from/)\\] Before whitening (color due to mineralization)\n\n\\[Vertical text next to large image of domestic pig dentition\\] Sus domesticus lower jaw dentition\n\n\\------------\n\n[The image of a domestic pig jaw](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Domestic_pig_jaw.jpg) on which I described the dentition\n\n[Translated version of the dentition image](https://imgur.com/gallery/EGcJO6v)",

I had no other choice but to quickly print another corrected version of the paper tomorrow - I was lucky that each Wednesday the 2. lesson doesn't happen.\n\n21st December, the day I donate this thing to the biology class. I decided to go to the 1st-6th grade building of my school to print the paper, as I wasn't sure if I could do that in the school building I am studying in (7th-12th grades).\n\nFYI - The school consists of two buildings - elementary school building (grades 1 to 6 - oldest one, but now renovated - still has older equipment than the new one I am in) and the middle/high school building, which houses grades 7 to 12, I am 10. It was built in 2017, is larger and more advanced than the elementary building - it has at least 20 LEGO EV3 education sets for robotics, some 3D printers, woodworking equipment, more. Together they are form a secondary school. Robotics has already made me suffer with 3D printers and the most with Lego, hard to imagine what will happen when we culminate with electronics.\n\nI got a very lousy print from the elementary building, but I appreciate that the principal was kind enough to let me print it during a lesson.\n\nThen I printed the paper in the high school building, it came out very good, but quite paradoxically... still not as good as the print from my local library, probably because the library uses a laser printer.\n\nI cut out the newly printed descriptions, glued them onto the already attached descriptions that suffered 6th degree marker burns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I took the photo of the project, that is the first image in the gallery for this post. On the livid-color bench, I finished this project, giving it away just 3h later. Fin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe biology class got cleaned-up after I donated this project, that is most student assignment projects and voluntarily donated self-made projects & objects were put in storage. Even the small fossils that don't really take up space.\n\nSomewhat disappointed that mine got put in storage too, since I was promised that it would be put on a shelf.  Only the best of the best and a few others are now at display - and most bones are without a transcription. It's their organization rules and stuff, but the class now looks a lot blander. What am I to go arguing with them, until I don't finish the vole skull project I won't talk about it.\n\nI hope that it is safe and hasn't been thrown out or lost. Maybe donating it before Christmas wasn't a good idea, you know, janitors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis project taught me how hydrogen peroxide works, dentition & properties of wild boars & domestic pigs, their differences & similarities. I never realized that the oxygen radicals are what gives peroxide its power. It's a long way until the other kids will learn this in standard chemistry lessons.\n\nThere are some sections in the descriptions that would seem awkward to a knowledgeable person in an related field. In particular the one about peroxide damaging bones might be.\n\nMaybe I should have called the oxygen radicals reactive oxygen species. [Reactive species](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/reactive-species#:~:text=Reactive%20species%3A%20Reactive%20species%20is,nonradicals%2C%20such%20as%20hydrogen%20peroxide) are the same term as radicals, they just make more sense to readers.

                "body": "\\--------------\n\nHere is the lore for my first post on r/biology: At the time I found this pig jaw fragment I was already working on a similar project - [back in September 2022 I found a dead vole](https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/y5dskh/i_buried_a_dead_rat_killed_by_delayed_rat_poison/) near a concrete growing bed and got an idea: to bury the vole, recover the bones after a month or so, articulate them, put the skeleton on a platform with a descriptive paper and donate it to my school as an educational piece.\n\nSo I buried the vole in a short barrel, but my father or something emptied the barrel, after I month I was lucky to find the vole skull and a few other bones - cervical spine, few ribs nearby the place it was emptied.\n\nOne person might come to your mind: Jeffrey Dahmer. I can only accept the memes as I put myself in this position, I did the same thing by choosing to talk about this vole skull project in Nov 2022 when I and my classmates had to make an 4 - 8 min speech and speak in front of the class (it was a spontaneous task during a special lesson we have each month for the whole day).\n\nThe speech received a similar reaction like [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/y5dskh/i_buried_a_dead_rat_killed_by_delayed_rat_poison/). It was both weird and inspiring to the class. It's interesting how something associated with bone collecting was/is prominent in serial killers, like H. H. Holmes (though he stole corpses, not clear if he collected bones).\n\nThen why did I talk about it if I knew that it would be quite strange when I could talk about my [pine nut harvesting pole project](https://imgur.com/a/5bGatRh) or the [things I do associated with pine nuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowingPineNuts/)? At that time it seemed the most interesting thing to me, also it was directly related to school, as I plan to donate the platform. I didn't truly have the deep perspective on the PN-2 pole that I have after pondering. I could have presented myself as Adam Savage or William Padilla Brown of pine nuts, and out of everything I chose to make it look like I am Dahmer.\n\nI am only looking up to my idols Kanye West and Alex Jones, that's \\[the vole skull post and speech\\] the same thing I did here and in real life **/s**\n\nBone collecting is a thing I have never really done in the past. I recently took up [metalworking](https://imgur.com/gallery/J0qGgRF), I am extremely into pine nuts and pine nut trees and spontaneously got into bone collecting as I got an opportunity and was curious.\n\n\\--------------\n\nThe backstory for this project\n\nAfter accidentally excavating the mandible fragment I washed it thoroughly, confirming that it is from a pig. I assumed it came from a domestic pig, not a wild boar, as my grand-grandparents had pigs for some time while their property (on which I found it) was in its prime. I also thought it came from a young pig, as the smaller tooth didn't appear fully erupted.\n\nI started bleaching the bone fragment with 3% hydrogen peroxide, changed the solution every few days as I was bleaching for 2-3 weeks. The fragment had mineralized quite a lot, it had to be quite old, as the teeth (especially the smaller one) were very dark brown in color. I read that certain phosphates can turn fossils black if they seep into their mineral structure.\n\nProbably in the beginning of December I started making the platform for this project. I designed a dentition guide for the domestic pig using this [Wikimedia image from a veterinary anatomy museum](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Domestic_pig_jaw.jpg) (thanks to Wagner Souza e Silva).\n\nI made a platform from cardboard, glued black color paper onto the upper surface of it.\n\nAs I don't have a printer, I went to the closest library that is just 50 m away from me, where I wanted to print this guide in color alongside with an image of the fragment before whitening. Their printer was probably a laser one, it didn't have enough colors to give appropriate tinge to the both jaw images. Nevertheless, I printed the both images in b&w, the dentition guide and jaw fragment before whitening.\n\nI then visited another local library 2.5 km diagonally where I could print all images I needed in color - I also printed an additional small [image of a domestic pig skull](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Domestic_pig_skull_%28MAV%29.jpg) and credits for it - again, thanks to Wagner.\n\nThen a week before giving away this project in December I started writing 2 descriptions for this platform - domestic pig and wild boar differences, dentition & how H2O2 whitens bones. I needed a good font for the descriptions, and I came across the [Proxima Nova font](https://freefontsfamily.com/proxima-nova-font-family-free-download/). It is perfect for this type of text. I printed the descriptions in my close local library a day before (20th Dec) giving away the project to the bio teacher. I wrote the additional text on the platform with a white marker.\n\nThis is when things started getting heated. I noticed a mistake on the A4 print the description of difference between domestic pig and wild boar. Basically, I wrote that wild boars are larger and more massive than domestic pigs, which is wrong. I printed a corrected version of the paper 30 min later.\n\nThen I attached the descriptions to platform, folded them, and **wrote titles with a marker on one of the frontal folded faces of both descriptions.** The marker seeped through the paper, it was visible even on the black background of it.\n\nThe prints endured a tremendous amounts of tomfoolery and chicanery, anguish. So I had to print the corrected version again and glue it onto the already attached existing descriptions on the platform.\n\nI wanted to donate this project on 21st Dec as it was the last biology lesson we had in 2022.",

I also love going out especially to sports events and I don\u2019t shy away from learning new things so we don\u2019t necessarily need any interests in common, but I would love to have someone to play video games with. \n\nSome other things I like are sci fi movies, anime, being creative and writing, specifically writing stories but I haven\u2019t been that doing much as of late. \n\nI\u2019m not looking for anything specific but I would just love to have someone to talk to and develop a connection with at this point, all I\u2019m asking is that you\u2019re between 18-35 and open for a LDR or relationship, but I\u2019m also ok with finding new friends. I included the US in my title because I\u2019d love to more there eventually (and I watch lots of American sports) so if you\u2019re from there that\u2019d be perfect. I should also mention that I\u2019m only into masculine leaning guys. \n\nIf you read all this way without getting bored send me a message and please put effort in it so not just \u201chi\u201d and tell me something about yourself, also include a picture and I\u2019ll send one back."

In one you had to help a yeti with her spelling homework to get to the other side of some body of water. She would ask you how a word is spelled and if you spelled it right, she would make a piece of ice on the river for you to jump on so you would be a little closer to the other side. This would continue until there were enough pieces and you\u2019d be on the other side. There was another where you built a bridge and another where if you crossed that same bridge from the other side some kind of sea dragon would show up and wouldn\u2019t let you cross unless you spelled some words correctly?

I also had an imaginary friend until I was 14 and I used to even think I was hallucinating, but the more I think of it, the more I think I just imagined a friend because I was lonely.\n\nAlso kind of recently I was walking with a friend and I imagined being in a fight and I physically flinched. My friend asked what was up and I had to explain that I just vividly imagined getting punched.\n\nI can very vividly imagine most things. I don\u2019t confuse them with reality or stop seeing reality or anything but I can imagine myself feeling the texture of a brick wall if I want to and spin a cow around in my head. I can\u2019t usually imagine pain though and I can\u2019t always stop the cow from spinning. \n\nI really love having vivid imagination like this because I get to daydream a lot and imagine little music videos and it can be really useful at times."

                "body": "Mandatory disclaimer: Let me start by saying like any general statement it isn't true in every case and there a plenty of reasonable exceptions.\n\nHowever, the mass whaling and mashing of teeth surrounding the increased popularity of ai generated art has become so odious and frankly harder and harder to ignore that for some reason I chose tonight to share my thoughts on the matter. The majority of the people I've seen complain about it are younger so I'm aware that young people (myself included) are more inclined to heightened emotion. \n\nLet's be frank, unestablished artists with less experience have a fairly logical motive to be opposed to ai-art. Like any other industry or trade that has seen increased use of automation is a question of a stable economic future. In some cases, ai-art produces higher quality art than many newer artists for a lower price or even completely free. If the objections were made on these grounds I would be more understanding. Hell, I'm not overjoyed about the fact that the traditional working class has been priced out of their own livelihoods.\n\nSadly, these are not the grounds most of the people who go ballistic over every ai-generated image assert. The two main gripes I see are \"You should support real artists because they put heart into their artwork\" and \"AI generators steal from artists\".\n\n**#1 You should support real artists because they put heart into their artwork**\n\nI agree, good art has heart. Not every person makes good art and a lot of the people whining about this don't make particularly good art (yes I know all art is subjective and all artists are unicorns and insanely deep and special) and charge a decent sum of money for it. I'll be as nice as I can about it, if your work isn't designable from a computer doing a collage consider a different career. Don't give up drawing but if you can't deliver a quality service you are not entitled to people's business. I believe there should be concrete policy put in place to help mitigate the economic upheaval that increasing automation will cause. However, I don't think art makes up a significant enough sector of the economy to justify the attention it's getting. Quite frankly, an artist having to get a day job isn't equivalent to a guy who was worked all of his life at a GM plant and has no other marketable skills not being able to feed his family.\n\n**#2 AI generators steal from artists**\n\nBefore I get into this part, yes, there have been serious problems with ai-generators and intellectual property infringement. Artists get into lawsuits with each other fairly regularly. However by and large any given work of art is district from any work of art the algorithm has used to generate it. Moreover, great works are usually influenced by whatever is happening around them including what other creative people are doing. It's not just me saying this I stole the idea from famous art school bald guy Brian Eno \"I think although great new ideas are usually articulated by individuals they're nearly always generated by communities ... in art history and saying those were the important ones you know Picasso Rembrandt Shostakovich whatever whenever you look at any of those artists you find that they lived and draw from a very very active flourishing cultural scene and they were only one of the elements in that scene.\" To be succinct nobody can create art without either consciously or subconsciously borrowing from other artists that's what these machines are doing, that's what artists do.\n\nIn almost any other situation I'd rather drink a bottle of feline urine than say \"just leave it to the market\" but commissions of cartoon charterers doing random stuff isn't food, housing, or healthcare nor is it the basis of vast swathes of a countries livelihood. I frankly have a hard time feeling bad for the people that type paragraphs about how you're a bad person for using ai art because it'll make it harder for them to make furry NSFW art a career.  I don't think a computer can ever take the place of genuine human self-expression so I doubt this will kill real art. I also have serious problems with the ethics of ai but again those are rarely mentioned. I'd like to hear an artist's POV on this because I'm looking in from the outside."

She had been tortured with getting her bones broken with a hammer, burns, screwdriver I think, etc. \n\nI have been keeping the birthdays/death days in my calendar so that I can light a candle and remember them.  I\u2019d like to be able to find her again to keep her in my thoughts. \n\n\u00c9dit: not Sylvia likens, not Kathy bates, not Suzanne capper.

During this time, the Gravemind unknowingly transferred and STI (Sexually Transmitted Infection) of unknown Paramount. While this may be expected of such a sex driven and horny character such as the Gravemind, he didn't think of it at the time because it was so hot. It wasn't until the events of Halo 3, that the effects had already started, and the Arbiter had also unknowingly transmitted the STI during a threesome he had with the two playable elites. \n\nNow, that's well and good, but what does this mysterious STI have to with the visions these characters receive? Well at the end of Halo 2, when Cortana is left behind on High Charity, she was connected with the Master Chief, and through the boosting of signals using the Gravemind and High Charity's systems, was able to contact the Master Chief, and by proxy the two playable elites. If that is all it were, then it wouldn't be a big issue. However, I believe this signal is disrupting the functionality of the Master Chief's automatic masturbatory system built into his suit. Most of the pornographic material would be fed directly into his brain via his neural implant, mostly of the Cortana variety. However with these corrupted images of Cortana flooding this neural implant, it short circuited his automatic masturbatory system. With no time for repairs, the Master Chief is left with hard cock and no way to please it.\n\nSo my question for you all is, where does this leave his mental state? Does the destruction of the Gravemind cause the signal to disperse, allowing his Automatic Masturbatory System to reactivate, or would that later be repaired on the Forward Unto Dawn when the Mater Chief goes into Cryosleep? Would the death of Johnson be more impactful to the Master Chief he wasn't so horny? Let me know what you guys think."

The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops."

Our current router is the Netgear DSL Gateway Model 7550, which uses ADSL2+ \u2014 I am unsure if we support VDSL or how to find out if we do.\n\nOur ISP is AT&T. Those who owned our house before us had AT&T, but they eventually stopped serving the area, only allowing residences that were already part of their service to stay with them. In other words, we were grandfathered in.\n\nWe are having some issues with our AT&T internet service and are considering upgrading to separate modem and router devices for improved performance. However, we have had difficulty finding dedicated appliances that are compatible with DSL, and we are not sure if we just need a modem that supports DSL, or if we need a specific DSL-supporting router as well.\n\nWe have looked into other ISPs, but our only other option is Starlink, which has a two-year waiting list and does not have great reports from the one household in our neighborhood that has it. Every other family (except one other with AT&T) has DigitalPath, which does not have great reports either, but we cannot even get it due to signal blocking from nearby orchards \u2014 rather, we would need a large pole attached to our roof for what would likely still be a sketchy connection.\n\nWe once had a tolerably reliable internet connection, but a little more than a year ago we began experiencing problems, and AT&T replaced our modem-router with one of their own, which was reportedly only used occasionally to test internet connections. Shortly after, there was a long outage affecting 880 customers, which lasted for weeks. Since then, we have been experiencing persistent issues with our internet, including devices disconnecting and poor overall performance. This is despite having the same number of devices connected and the same amount of data usage as before.\n\nWe are hoping that the initial issue with our previous router may have actually been the result of whatever caused the large outage, and that the replacement modem-router was bad. If anyone has any suggestions for reliable DSL modems and routers, or advice on determining compatibility with our specific type of DSL connection, we would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance for your help!"

Key factors:\n\n- It\u2019s somehow very accessible and very alien simultaneously. It actually, I dunno, legit makes me uncomfortable, but in an incredibly pleasing way?\n\n- The timing, from the time signature itself, to the points when rhythms and even individual sounds and vocals appear or disappear.\n\n- The lyrics are some of my all-time favorites. It\u2019s a beautiful poem in its own right.\n\n- I agree with people who enjoy hearing her so happy! It feels like it\u2019s a celebratory spiritual sequel/answer to The Gate (\u201cmy silhouette is oval\u201d) in a way that\u2019s very satisfying but hard to explain.

They don\u2019t have a hive mind per se, but the instant one of them has to formulate a new compound word, all the other Kros are immediately aware of it and it becomes canon.\n\nAnd yeah, environment does have some impact on how different mergers surface. /kh/ is typically [\u03c7] before a voiceless plosive, and [k\u02b0] before a vowel, but there are exceptions.

I would really encourage him to get therapy.\n\nI'm going to assume (and by all means tell me if I'm wrong) that you're an empathetic person with a tendency to take on others' issues as your own. There might be some codependency too, but I'm only saying that because it tends to be a common extension of those traits. If my assumption is correct, then those tendencies are likely something he could pick up on, and he isn't necessarily trying to exploit that, but it would at least partially explain the speed and intensity of his bonding with you.\n\nIf he's requesting total honesty, then that should include very direct clarity on what your expectations actually are going forward, and the same for him. It sounds like you're partly asking for advice on how to sort those expectations out, but total honestly would include the fact that you don't have a lot of certainty on that. At the very least, this gives him the opportunity to respect that, and to know that it's unfair to place too many expectations on you while you're figuring all this out. If he can't handle that, then it's a sign that that he might not be able to handle other boundaries in the future.\n\nTotal honesty is important to have with yourself as well. In some ways, a person is in a kind of relationship with themselves. How do you treat yourself? How do you communicate with yourself? Are you a good friend to yourself? Are you willing to give yourself a reality check if you need it?\n\nIf he's also depending on you to meet certain needs of his, then it'll upset him if you're unable to provide that. He's ostensibly having sex with guys as a form of escapism, and if you two were to be exclusive, that means you're going to be his exclusive source of that escape. Are you okay with that? How do you feel knowing that this is going to be part of his intent whenever you guys are intimate?\n\nIf he can't sort himself out on his own, he won't be able to sort himself out through your relationship either, regardless of the shape it takes. The support and affection can definitely help, but it won't be the magic key to pulling him up out of his misery. I'd suggest you also do some self-reflection: how are you doing, mentally and emotionally? If you're willing to help him put on his oxygen mask, have you put on yours first?\n\nTry as you both might, I believe it's not really possibly to just decide not to have feelings. They're clearly already there for both of you, and it's unrealistic to say you can just shut those off. Those seeds are already planted, and they're likely to keep growing as time goes on. The longer things stay in limbo, the harder it's going to be to put up those boundaries and, if necessary, completely take yourself out of the situation.\n\nI wish you the best. It sounds like a stressful situation and I'm sorry you're having to deal with it.",

Please try to contain your outrage.\n\nSuggestion #1: *ma Tominiki* or *ma Tomini*, based on the French name *Dominique* and Dominican Creole *Donminik*. That would make it very similar to *ma Tominika*, but that\u2019s already true of their names in other languages. It also fits the pattern of using the official country name in the local pronunciation.\n\nSuggestion #2: *ma Wetukupuli*, based on the pre-colonial Carib name for the island, *Wai\u2018tu kubuli*. Dominica is the only country in the area that still has a population of Island Carib people, though they are now vastly outnumbered.\n\nThere we have it. Now we can sleep with a clear conscience, knowing that the proud people of Dominica have a place in the world once again.\n\nEDIT: u/-dev-urandom- pointed out that *pu* also has just one Congo.

Who downplays outright attacks on herself as mere issues and is only concerned with fixing the relationship? Who allows themselves to be called a pedophile at church, to be spit upon and slapped, and to have their car keyed up? It may not be her intentions, but OP's actions enable, almost encourage, more drama to befall her and her family. By not allowing people to face the consequences of their actions, OP indirectly endangers herself on a continuous basis.\r  \n\r  \nI do not say this often, if ever, but the church administrator was correct. Press charges on Emily for vandalizing OP's car. Obviously. If Emily had even an ounce of pushback, it may not have escalated to all of this. The unchecked carnage culminating in breaking the bones of a German shepherd and finding out that several kids were abused should not be a surprise and may have been avoided. OP needs therapy for indirectly enabling. I want to be clear, super clear: Emily's actions were not OP's fault. But danger can often be circumvented.\r  \n\r  \nI mean, I like to be a nice person and am okay with people taking advantage of kindness once or twice. But allowing repeated unremorseful attacks exposes either a penchant for drama, an inability to discern predictable dangers to self and family, or an unhealthy desire to be liked by everyone. I feel bad, especially for the husband. I'd be thinking, \"What other danger is she going to willingly allow into our home?\" Get help.",

You saw a picture she cared about get replaced with a picture of you and without any empathy imply she improperly reacted with a sneer and a scoff.  Instead of making a post months or years ago in an appropriate thread asking for suggestions on how to help your family member, you watch as her pain increases and causes more collateral damage to you and the rest of family.  This confirms what you mentioned earlier in your post, you just do not like her.  So you blow up on her in front of everyone, maybe irreparably damaging her relationship with the family, possible causing another /s \"wonderful\" no contact scenario. Then you come in here where you know many redditors enjoy seeing families implode and you'll get validation for your actions.\n\nListen, I'm not saying you are responsible for her well being.  She is obviously in pain and has been trying to figure out what going on by psychoanalyzing the situation but has gotten stuck on everyone else's possible role instead of focusing on healing herself.  She may or may not heal from this.  But a loving family member ie someone who tried to find a way to reach her at a more conducive time may have been a difference maker.  While it may be too late to prevent the damage that has been done, imo it is not too late to try to repair the relationship and find a way to support Bella in healing herself.  I sure hope this doesn't turn into another /s \"happy reddit ending\" frequently featured in these threads where no one in a family talks to one another.  Best wishes.",

It seems that the father wanted to leave his wife as little as possible, so he set up the house in a trust for his daughter and left his wife with only a small amount of money in the will. However, the house can be contested, and the lawyer knows this. The self admitted well-off daughter likely knows as well from her lawyer since she admitted that it would not be cheap to contest. A widow generally has life estate rights to the house, but it will take a lawyer to enforce those rights against the lawyer hired by the daughter to evict the widow. The poorer widow cannot afford this, and the daughter feels guilty and has come here with a trickle truth story to find support for her actions. Shame on OOP for not attempting to find a solution that works for all. There are some good suggestions in this thread.\n\nFor a better explanation, I recommend checking out Comprehensive-Sea-63's original reply. It is worth noting that the unknown variable in this situation is the reason why the father wanted to leave his wife destitute. That isn\u2019t known but in my opinion, the father enacting revenge through an underhanded will, the daughter knowingly ousting the widow despite her rights through expensive legal maneuvering the widow can\u2019t match to give her own daughter a second trust, and then trying to garner support from Reddit with a sly story does not reflect well on that family.",

It's understandable that you would feel frustrated and upset by what happened.  \nIt's important to note that every state has its own laws and regulations regarding trespassing, and I'm not familiar with the specific laws in Florida. **However, in general, a person can be charged with trespassing if they remain on someone else's property after being asked to leave, or if they enter someone else's property without permission.**  \nIt's possible that the employee at Walmart believed you were trespassing by refusing to leave the store after it had closed. However, it's also possible that the employee's actions were not justified, and that you were wrongly accused of trespassing.  \nRegardless of the specific circumstances, it's important to remember that it's never appropriate to become aggressive or violent when interacting with police or store employees. If you feel that you were wrongly accused or treated unfairly, it may be helpful to speak with a lawyer or seek legal advice to understand your options.\"\n\nI'm going to put the computer AI has voting YTA.  haha",

Her son-in-law said she knew exactly why her daughter was upset at her uncle yet she claimed she didn't.  Plus she had a psychotic break which alludes to something being repressed more than simple denial.\n\nGiven the age differences between the mother and her brother, the only thing I can think of is she, as a child, abused (read: moles... or just witnessed) her brother who was 6 years younger, felt guilty and the abuse was repressed.  Later, she found her former victim now abusing others, namely her own daughter.  And that messed her subconscious up. She wants to just deny the abuse ever happened since if it did, it would be her fault for initially abusing the uncle.  So her subconscious is driving her mad and she isn't even be fully aware of how this is affecting her emotions.  I don't know, that's my best guess, I hope someone with more insight can shed some light on what is going on with the mother.  I shudder to think she was complicit in  some other way...",

                "body": "It\u2019s the old quality versus quantity debate. Slow versus Fast. Valve versus HTC. Valve has released one VR complete headset package in past 6 years. HTC has released at least 5. (I\u2019ll let those more knowledgeable than me explain who should get the most credit for the original Vive.)\n\nThe Valve Index, released in 2019, was the peak of VR 1.0, many considering it at the footsteps of 2.0. But ever since then, the high end PC VR industry continues to falter on widespread adoption of the next generation technology like being wireless and featuring eye tracking to allow for foveated rending. Furthermore, the Index screen resolution is barely acceptable by today\u2019s standards. Consumers also desire OLED like black levels in the display, but this may remain a wishlist item as most VR headset engineers seem to have widely adopted fast-switching LCD screens.\n\nMy needs are rather unique. I\u2019m a passive guy and love passive entertainment ie watching movies. Covid took away one of my favorite pastimes \u2013 heading down to the local Imax theater to be engrossed in the latest summer blockbuster hit. Big Screen Beta on the Valve Index has been a great substitute. Watching movies on a virtual large screen has been fun. But the resolution leaves much video detail on the table. While nothing can compare to an Imax screen resolution and fidelity yet, there has been great improvements since the release of the Index.\n\nSo I sit at a dilemma. VR 2.0 tech like eye tracking and wireless are still not available in a headset that soundly beats the PC VR sector leader-the Valve Index. But that tech is not necessary for my immediate video watching needs. They\u2019d be more beneficial for my more occasional game playing but tbh, I\u2019m still content with the Index. Some goggles have superior displays like the HP Reverb G2 and Pimax 5k and 8k but with some very serious caveats to movie watching (narrow fov and screen distortion respectively). But now there is a new entry onto the PC VR market. The Vive Pro 2 by HTC, the company infamous for releasing a ton of product with incremental improvements.\n\nI think it has been substantially established by the competent early reviewers that the Vive Pro 2 display is superior to the Index in every way except for vertical fov. Plus, there are rumors an eye tracking module will be released before the end of the year. So I think for my needs, the Vive Pro 2 will be a satisfactory improvement over the Index and it\u2019ll be available in just a week. \n\nIt just worries me buying a product from such a dumb company. Using the same microphone that\u2019s been universally maligned for years? Stupid. But it doesn\u2019t affect me since I rarely game online. Using the same speakers that\u2019s been clearly bypassed by almost all your competition? Either lazy or just flat-out dumb decision making at the highest level, likely both. But I can get a usb-c to 3.5mm adapter to plug in my headphones. \n\nOn the other hand, Valve has the exact opposite problem. Most of their products are at the very slightest, extremely innovative and often sets new industry standards. But they are slow with a capital S. Who knows when the next Index will arrive, could literally be 5 years from now. So do I wait for their next amazing innovation or go with something that is better for my specific needs now even though the headset will also feature old tech and outdated design? Thankfully, there\u2019s no need to wait. But being with an idiot even temporarily just never feels right\u2026"

(Being in Iran might mean we can't meet physically.)\n\nI am an ex-muslim atheist; so religious people aren't my best choices.\n\nI love theory of Art, Music, Designing. I play the violin and draw and write at free/emotional times.\nI like classical music and every other genre as long as I find good meaning and pleasing tunes.\nI'm 4w5 which means I can be VERY emotional internally at times. But mostly I'm logical and don't disturb you with my emotions.\n\nI am a video designer beside being a student so I am alittle busy and I might not be available everyday/for long hours. But I enjoy deep conversations.\n\nI want to share a secret (plz don't judge me):\nI always wanted to be born a girl. I enjoyed dressing girls clothes lmao. \ud83d\ude05\nBut I wouldn't call my self transgender because I managed to somehow accept myself. So I would call me non-binary.\n\nI'm not a big talker and I hate talking alot. But I LOVE listening to others. I like to learn more about other people; honesty is important to me.\nI might wanna talk about my issues and have a shoulder to cry on sometimes.\n\nMy first expectation is NOT BEING A Stupid/Horny/Jerk/Close-Minded person.\n\nI like left-out people (not fake people). And I hate social norms.\n\nI'm looking for a NOT Feminine/overly-emotional character. I like tomboys, and other bisexuals.\n\nI also like these general characteristics as everyone does:\nBeing blunt, straight forward, Loyal, Warm, and Protective.\n\nMy Instagram for more personal things:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/abbas_flower/\n\nIMPORTANT: I'm sorry to mention so many tough values. I just wanted to make sure I have covered everything. As long as you have my first expectations and you can accept me the way I am, you are welcome."

I'm from Asia so the main diet is rice. When you cut out rice there's barely anything left to eat. If I try to cut out the rice and double the protein, the price would exceed my daily expense limit plus I would still not full.

They just started appearing on his thighs but now they\u2019ve spread throughout most of his body (back, torso, thighs, legs, and the upper part of his arms). \nUpon waking up, he says the rashes don\u2019t itch much but once the day actually starts and he gets to work, it gets really itchy. They\u2019re like red spots that look slightly raised, and they especially swell up when he\u2019s fresh out of the bath. On the first few days, he applied some local topical cream every night, but it didn\u2019t really work and more just appeared. He switched to a different local topical treatment but it didn\u2019t really seem to work either. He also took some generic antihistamines. \n\nAfter a week, he finally bought some calamine lotion from the pharmacy and some branded antihistamines. He\u2019s been taking these for about four days now but his skin doesn\u2019t really seem to be healing yet. What are these and how do we get rid of them?"

Fast forward to people screaming and my uncle barricading it with my help people were screaming below and loud noises were happening down below and running.\nThen we hear someone knock on our door asking for us to let him in then my uncle and I hide farther in the room. So then he breaks in the door somehow and says hey I\u2019m not here to kill I need help he was like an old western man with a black jacket on top, cackey pants, and a button shirt too. He then closes the blinds and pushes us both shooting my uncle in the head first but aiming at the center of his head (idfk why I remember this) then he looks at me the gun wasn\u2019t normal I remember it, it was a ray gun not from cod but I swear it seemed like it green, yellow and white childish in a way. He then says goodbye \u201c*my actual name*\u201d then shoots me in my head. I wake up to this heaven it was bright but dark yk the track super Mario rainbow road imagine that but less colorful and mainly yellow. I see hundreds pouring in like a treadmill it was like ready player one and I see this reality. People were literally virtual reality. They had their own currency, own avatar options and games except it was somewhat more real life. I walked in the city and crowds saw that man projecting from the screen who killed me the owner. He said stuff then this girl purple girl from world at Warcraft said \u201cyour supposed to be dead, your famous, you died xx/xx/ in the 90\u2019s not the 90\u2019s the 2090\u2019s. It was so creepy but then his guards  notice me it was random people so i start running and for some reason could jump higher than before. I remember seeing it super Mario you could play, titles I hadn\u2019t even see in my life mostly blue color. Then I hid, hid for a while then the guards stop me and capture me to then take me the boss is like blah blah something about how I\u2019m suppose to die for the world. Then I get saved by the girl who uses a sword from like Skyrim. Note I never played Skyrim and played cod my whole life. She then comes killing them telling me to run. I run into this Skyrim world I see someone and kill them? I don\u2019t exactly know how but this gui system let me kill them from behind and the gui look like sao I\u2019m not kidding so then I walk around this palace near this boardwalk or bridge that crosses a lake like not a fancy bridge just a wooden plank across a lake I see one guy standing with an arrow too that alerts the people or enemy\u2019s and I don\u2019t my chances and peak in the church of sorts and see my enemy\u2019s all purple auras, Viking men one of them spot me then the man guarding shoots an arrow at me and I successfully kill him then I run as the men these 8-9 ft men chase me I then go along this other castle asking for help these kids looked my age and bad pointy ears an elf to say? They had red shirts all of them then helped me I stood behind them but coming in was the green shirted people though they were friendly toward the red shirt and helped defend me because they knew I was nice. This is so weird Reddit why was it specific . Also to add onto that chase I was like in a random city that looked like something off Batman and there was a big squishy blob that let me jump and let me played this parkour game bc I was running from these two Bears one small ( a baby) and the other bigger (it\u2019s mother)probably henchmen of the guy trying to kill me? I then woke up stressed like someone was gonna kill me my life is fine the most nervous I\u2019ve been about was my first day of school at a new school but it hadn\u2019t stressed me so much? Idk somethings weird about this it\u2019s like ready player one the movie\n \nSide note I\u2019m 15 if this helps understand it"

Imagine a future where conservatives had a lot of control over the seats of government and there was a large momentum swing towards the Left.  What do you think we would see on Reddit?  Imagine a future where Liberals controlled the seats of power and the country was taking a large swing to the Right.  What do you think we would expect to see on Reddit?  Basically think of the Regan wave but it either being blue or red and during a time when Reddit exists.\n\nI'm wondering if we would see more posts as a powerbase was climbing or if they would lash out more as a side fell.  I think there are likely some hidden trends we could learn from this thought experiment.  I'm hoping to avoid the normal \"My side good, other side bad\" that is common when examining current events.  Instead, let's think about larger trends and truths that can come from one powerbase waning while another rises. That's why I tried to remove it from any particular election or upcoming election.  I'll be interested in hearing your thoughts."

I also planned on applying for graduate school this year for a fairly competitive program and now that might have to take the back burner because of not being able to graduate in time. Also, not sure how well grad school committees will take to a semester of withdrawals due to elective surgery.\n\nI also have student loans to worry about because I have previously dropped a semester so I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t be eligible for loans for the next 12 months. I\u2019ll definitely call and ask if there are exceptions to that rule but fuck I\u2019m in pain and i have no clue what to do at this point. \n\nAny advice or anyone who\u2019s gone through something similar? \n\nTL;DR: need major surgery for my torso that will put me out of school for months that can affect grad school and student loans and not sure what to do. \n\nThanks for listening."

The extruder cable is too small for connection to the board itself. I've bought another one of the cables for the issue, but it can only allow connections if I cut the part that connects to the extruder itself, and then splicing those wires onto the original wires. Should I go for a soldering method with heat-shrink , or would it be safeer/better to use uy idc connectors?\n2. The heater cartridge is too short for connection to the board, would it be better to move the board, or to just get a 40w heater cartridge from th3d and use that with the heater block and thermistor. Is that even possible? If so, what changes should I use for marlin firmware?\n\nAll help and suggestions on how you did your setup are welcome and would be greatly appreciated.

They were so offended and outraged that they wanted to blame all aces?? \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22 My LGBTQA+ friends from college are the reason why I was able to build up my courage to come out to everyone and how I accepted that I wasn't broken or had a mental illness just for not wanting sex, flings or sexual-related activities in general. I was even invited to give some sort of TEDtalks-like gigs during PRIDE month in college about being asexual and educating younger students about Asexuality. \n\nI don't wanna fight fire with venom and I just don't have the emotional strength to do so and I also have really bad GAD since I was a teen, so I just stop myself from responding. But it's hard, because some of the mean tweets are just so distasteful and just wants to attack us as people and they're spreading the hate like wildfire. I want to defend our community but I'm afraid of coming off as being whiny. \n\nBut it sucks, man. We're like only roughly 1% of the population and some of us don't even know that we're ace and are able to come out as one-so it's really rare for us to meet each other IRL, so like the LGBTQA+ peeps were supposed to have our backs since most straights don't want anything to do with us (I don't know from your experience but from where I'm from in the Philippines, them straights think we're fucked up in the head and some of the people I thought were my friends would joke that probably raping me would convert me into \"being normal\". Gross, yeah?). My gay, bi, pan, and lesbian friends have been the ones encouraging me as I grew more confident in myself. I don't have them close to me anymore since I moved out of my university town for work and live in a different area. I was planning to make new friends here in my current city and attend the PRIDE march last year when this things started. I was so scared that I would be unwelcomed, or probably something worse. So I didn't go. \n\nIt's just that PRIDE month is nearing again and I really want to make new friends, but this issue has just been giving me panic attacks for so long, I might just give up.

It makes sense you'd want to make sure no one has control over your mind more than you.\n\nI don't care how much you know, your knowledge will never work if your mind and body is malnourished. Eating highly and ultraprocessed foods has an affect on your body and mind in a negative way.\n\nOur body has an electrical system and uses light to communication with other cells or neurons in the body, and it helps keep certain organs working, like the heart. Hence, why a cardiac arrest is an electrical problem, and your heart loses its power to pump blood. Every time your heart pumps, it is using electricity to do so.\n\nWhen you heavily eat processed foods and meat, you are, in a way, damaging your bodies ability to use light, electricity. Meat or highly processed foods can't transfer as much energy to fuel or charge your body as much as fruits and vegetables.\n\nFruits and vegetables conduct the most electricity, hence it has a higher nutritional value, because it can provide you with more light/energy. This is why you can think better and function better on a diet that cuts out processed foods and focuses on whole plants. \n\nIf fruits and vegetables conduct the most electricity/light, then it makes sense that your body and mind functions better, neurons can communicate better because you gave your brain the most efficient energy through your diet.\n\nWhen you constantly feed your body of that kind of energy, you have greater control over your mind, which means your magick becomes stronger than other people's magick. Your mind is more vulnerable and susceptible to influence on a weak diet because your body and mind are weak as a result. So, I think a plant based diet really gives you an edge, because you know most people aren't feeding their bodies this way, which means they cannot function at their fullest potential.\n\nA plant based diet provides similar gifts yoga gives you, which is an anti-anxiety/anger gift. Your nervous system is less stressed, you have more energy, and you have control over your mind. It's hard to explain, you can only experience it. It's a deep level of tranquility, yet you're locked in. \n\nYou'd have to experience it to know what I mean. You're seated in a pocket of peace within your whole being, which allows you to tackle any problem that comes your way without stressing out your nervous system.\n\nSorry this was so long, and hopefully this makes sense. You'll be surprised at how simple yet powerful your diet can be in shaping you as a person and as a practitioner of magick.",

Exactly the locked behaviour, the only difference is that if I apply memory OC the hashrate goes up to 26 or 27...so it's not really locked.(Tested it using HDMI dummy and also with an actual monitor pluged into it)\n\nSo here is my question, can it be a motherboard limitation and it's pcie port?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe specs are:MB: Asus H61M-F\n\nCPU: Intel Pentium G2030 3Ghz\n\nRAM: 4GB DDR4\n\nHDD: WD 500GB non SSD\n\nThe MB has 1xPCIe x16 port where I plug the 3060... maybe that port is not fast enough? or the CPU can't handle the GPU? I'm confused :\\\\\n\nPS: If I check MB specs at ASUS website it says PCIe 2.0, but the MB itself has printed PCIe 3.0 on it... are we facing a marketing scam? haha\n\nPS2: If I try to mine with my GTX1060 it works perfectly at it's normal hashrate...so I think it's not a PCIe 2.0 port\n\nWell... I hope someone can help me with this, thank you in advance.  \n\n\nSOLUTION: Like  [twix41](https://www.reddit.com/user/twix41/) said, the problem was the CPU, replaced it with an i5-3470 and now I get 50MH/s with the 3060"

The most common config I saw was core: -502, mem: +1200, Pw: 68%\n\nIf I do that, I get 50MH/s and 115w but with random resets with a black screen and back to default clocks.\n\nI've been trying to lower the mem until I had it working at core: -502 mem: +1140 with a result of 49.7MH/s\n\nGreat! Until 7-8 hours later it crashed again and back to default settings... since then tried a lot of different combinations but in the end always crashes after maybe 20 mins or 2 hours...\n\nSo I'm fucking lost and confused haha\n\nHelp would be really appreciated.

She's not your next of kin and should have no business invading your personal life and space. Although she has mental illness, she still needs to respect your boundaries and preferences. You've been considerate to her, like disclosing your whereabouts which you actually don't need to, so should her be thoughtful to you.\n\nEdit: ofc to be more polite and soft when you say these considering her mental illness (es).

It's also hard to believe anyone could still be pressure-free when you're constantly surrounded by media's eyeS. Therefore, maybe he is serious, the media just failed to disclose this part. There's also possibility that DR is serious, but chooses to put on a smiley face and doing goofy stuff to shows people he's still capable to withstand the pressure and do his best. Or uses it to hide away frustrations. Or simply keep people from worrying about him, uplifting people's spirits. As sometimes people do that. Anyway I'm putting wayyyyy too much hypothesis here.\n\nAnd yes, I think he needs to show all that dedication, commitment and determination on camera. Cuz it's probably the only way to have people know that he cares and for some people to put their faith in him, in the team's future performance. It's unfortunate people nowadays really treat those short interviews/ unboxed as 24hrs. But adaptions are needed to cater this from some perspectives.",

So far most of the character is just the usual undomesticated species of animals but then comes the problem with specific domesticated breeds mostly with pets like dogs and potentially other animals they are basically the product of human selection. So in a scenario where those breeds happened to be there, it would be a bit tricky to explain for their existence without humans or a form of precursor civilization? Since that is not what I intended to write and would create more unnecessary complications to the story. (even though this itself is already complicated) although the law of genetic and breeding maybe a bit wackier to allow some narrative to happen (it's kind of important. Since 1 of the primary characters is a hybrid rabbit-dog with lop ears as a form of birth defect and get bullied and discriminated against because of that)\n\nI had think of some way to explain their existence like adaptation, culture, subspecies, social conformity, a form of weird self-selection, or genetic mutation but it all seems to lead to a sort of dead-end in an attempt to have an explanation for those behaviors that related to it without bringing up the culture and ethic of the problem (but then again it was a fictional world they may not think like a human). May there be some tip or way out there to improve or find a way out?\n\n2)Second is the animal class inclusion currently we classify a total of 5 classes of vertebrates fish would be impossible so it would be excluded out but it's left amphibian, reptile, and bird in the ambiguous zone and the only clear one is mammal. I'm feeling a bit indecisive on this one since there are many possibilities for this.  \n\n3) The last is just about the inclusion of actual feral animals that walks on four-leg. If I put them in would the context be able to compare with humans and chimps share a common ancestor or would it be more messed up or over-complicated to the world I should just exclude it out\n\n(ill write more context if needed )"

Sure, you can learn to deal with it. Undiagnosed? Some will continue to struggle.\n\nSo I wouldn't exclude the possibility of ADHD whatsoever. Don't forget that other mental illnesses can make the symptoms much worse too.\n\nAbout the medication: I can't say too much about whether it's an indicator but even for stimulant medication the effect on you can be vastly different depending on many factors. Which is why most people with ADHD try out different types of medication to settle on what has the best synergy on their bodies. You responding badly to one medication doesn't mean the others will not work better. Don't give up! \u2661",

I do this thing every single day, often for MONTHS and feel much better and am proud of myself for finally sticking with something. During those times I often even question whether I actually have ADHD if I can be this consistent. \n\nBut the thing is: I keep going to not ruin this \"pride\" that I have been doing this thing for every single day. Or, in case of grades, get an A in almost every subject. If it happens that I forget to do it or something else interrupts my routine, my brain goes: \"Well, now it's not perfect anymore, so it doesn't make a difference now whether or not you are doing it every single day or not\" and I stop doing the habit altogether. Even though in my brain I understand that those habits are good for me and made my mental health better, I just can't force myself to go back, often for YEARS.\n\nDoes anyone experience the same and has some advice for me? Both for giving everything up instantly and also being easily irritated if I can't do my routine? How can I do a routine that is still flexible enough to stand the test of time?"

                "body": "Hey everyone, hope you are doing fine.Originally I wanted to do a little research about this myself but there are not many posts about this that I could find so I thought I might as well ask here.\n\nI consider myself being grey ace - not completely ace but not really hetero either. I don't really look at people and say \"Oh, I really want to have sex with them\" but at the same time CAN get aroused by explicit imagery. One thing that has been bothering me however is my attitude towards sex. I never considered myself exactly sex repulsed. I can see how people would want that, I have nothing against porn, might even enjoy it, as long as I am not involved. However, it feels like my main issue lies in sexual attraction. I can't help but see it as something that is very animalistic, primitive, even DEGRADING. While I can totally understand forming a close connection first and express that connection with intimacy (I would try it if I ever find someone I like that much) but if it's about strangers or people you just barely know... it kinda makes me physically sick to hear people talk about how attractive they find other people. While with females I just can't relate with males I am downright DISGUSTED. Probably because I immediately imagine someone talking about me like that or wanting to have sex with ME just because of some animalistic instinct.\n\nThe more I talk to people who are not ace and realise just how much little things can arouse them I become more and more anxious about how I might be perceived if I ever put myself out there and start to date. I have this friend who I talked with about that topic who is very hetero. While we shared some common morals and agreed that the way sex is portrayed in media is disgusting, he was also very open about what he found attractive in general. So when we met and had some kind of date I was hyper sensitive to not do suggestive movements, not sending any signals etc. It was tiring. I knew he wouldn't do anything without me wanting it but the thought that his body might REACT felt really strange to me.\n\nThings like that make me wonder if I am truly ace or if the way people express sexual attraction and how it is so \"normal\" just repulses me. What if I actually would feel sexual attraction if I would be more comfortable about the whole dating thing and instincts? It's even much easier for me to fall in love with people if I KNOW they have no interest in sleeping with me. Then, after getting romantic feelings for them, I might think \"yeah, sleeping with them might be okay\". But I was in love only 3 times in my life, 2 times it were people I've never met before in person, so I guess I can't really say that much about how I would have reacted if it was about to happen. I don't really like dating, I don't like flirting and people who either stare at me or do a smug face make me want to run away. I feel like I am just seen for my body, as a means to release some urge instead of a human being with a personality. While I want to be in a relationship I refuse to make myself look pretty for people because I am afraid that might attract the wrong people... it's complicated.\n\nAnyone out here with a similar problem? I most probably think about it too much but at times it can be frustrating to see other ace people being like \"okay, I don't care if we have sex now\", like one of my friends does. Or know that it's something they don't want so they can communicate that from the start. But I am not sure if I could want it if I would ever be in a relationship so I can't really relate to any of the groups. I don't feel like I am repulsed, absolutely indifferent or positive..."

It\u2019s of course subtitled, but I got so much more out of it being able to understand a lot of what they were saying. I basically glanced at the subtitles after every line to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. The actors speak very clearly and I was able to understand a large percentage (maybe 50-75%) of what was said. There were entire conversations I understand which was pleasing. **I highly recommend it for learners of any level**, there\u2019s always subtitles to fall back on, and it\u2019s always exciting to catch some words or phrases you recognize. \n\nAside from language it was an incredibly entertaining movie that respected Chinese culture. **You don\u2019t even need to know anything about the Marvel universe** to get it (there\u2019s only one minor character from Dr. Strange). It\u2019s actually much more like a fantasy/sci-fi Chinese drama than just a typical marvel movie. It might be my favorite Marvel movie and I\u2019ve seen all of them.

I was also quite regretful of my results and my brother only made things worse by verbalising the regrets I already had. I still remember having many anxiety attacks days before results day because I only had 50rp for prelims, which made me doubt my abilities to improve enough for my A\u2019s to at least get a decent score. \n\nEventually I got 75rp. Pretty average, but I was satisfied because that meant a local uni placement for me in a course that I would be okay with, although not the dream courses I had in mind. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t deny the fact that yi has a high j1 retention rate, and that many people in my batch didn\u2019t do well enough for even the bare minimum to go into local uni. My main point is that if you study hard enough you need not suffer the same fate that many yi students face. \n\nSo yeah, don\u2019t sweat it too much. Do whatever it takes to do well (be attentive in class, clarify whatever you need to clarify in class, revise consistently, etc). From what I remember from last time, there are tons of conducive study spots in yi so make good use of them. \n\nAt the same time, don\u2019t burn yourself out. Have a little bit of fun occasionally. Find the right group of friends who know when to joke around and have fun and also when to get serious and study. Enjoy the lunch and dinner dates with your friends at Northpoint(you\u2019re absolutely spoilt for choice when you want to eat there). \n\nTo all my yi juniors, I wish you all the best for your next 2 years, so please do your best as well :)",

I hit my lowest during cb when I had very little friends that I could talk to or have calls with (kid you not, I had never used Houseparty during cb even when I downloaded it and stuff) and ofc depressive episodes kicked in again. \n\nI still had a few friends after cb, but by the time I was in J2 I felt like most of them got bored of me too and I only have 3 friends to have small talks with but either way it was clear that they\u2019d rather hang out with other friends/cliques they were in. \n\nAt this point I don\u2019t know what to do. MYE for H1 subjects are around the corner, done 0 revision and am super unmotivated to start, and nobody\u2019s around to push me to study. I fell like I\u2019m being under a curse of being alone for life now and I seriously don\u2019t know what to do\n\nEdit: omg wHAT I didn\u2019t expect this post to blow up. Thanks for all your helpful comments (even including ones that motivated me to study harder!!)."

One thing I noticed was that the questions in H2 physics are wAY more complex than combined science. \n\nEverytime I attempt h2 physics questions, I struggle to do them. I struggle to understand the question and have difficulties in applying formulas. And the fact that brings my morale to rock bottom is that even if I understand how to do one question I most likely won\u2019t know to do another. \n\nAt this point if I don\u2019t do decently well (ie prob C/B and above) for promos I\u2019d probably not meet the promotional criteria because for all the other components for the promotional criteria for physics (ie graded assignments, CTs) I\u2019ve done rather badly. \n\nSo yeah I\u2019m in desperate need for help"

After that was settled, I began stressing out on my academics. I took combined science in o levels and have taken up 2 h2 science subjects in JC. I became stressed from the big jump in difficulty and depth of the topics, and there were stuff that was only taught in pure science that the lecturers assumed we knew about and I had to figure that out myself. \n\nBut one of the reasons I am still persevering on is my friends in my og and class. They've been making JC life way more bearable and enjoyable and I always knew that they were also in the same boat. \n\nHowever, because of HBL today, I hadn't had any interactions with them, besides them asking about HBL matters. Moreover, I am a peripheral member of a clique I am in now, and I only talk to them at school and they'd normally do stuff like facetime without me (they're actually really nice ppl and I have nothing against them, I just haven't reached that level of closeness in my friendships with them compared to them with one another, don't misinterpret it as exclusion). \n\nAnd often times when I'm alone, a lot of negative and insecure feelings would cloud my thoughts and I'd often mumble deprecating things about myself. And given that HBL will start daily from next week, I have become worried about my mental wellness as I'd probably have very little interaction with my friends. There have been articles about how cases of mental health issues in people have spiked on the first day of lockdown in the UK, and I'm worried that my mental health will further deteriorate after the full HBL has been implemented. \n\nI don't need anyone's pity or sympathy or anything like that, because I just wanted to vent out my feelings. As much as I want to be closer to my friends at school and want to do all those close friends would do, I probably won't be able to because tbh I haven't really done that with my friends in pri or sec sch, what makes me think I can have such close friendships in JC life?"

Something in me felt like there was something different compared to what I learnt about God's creation in the Bible. Upon other research on the internet, I came across something called \"Christian geography\", which I assume is modern geography altered to agree with the Bible. Other than that, I felt like I am losing more and more interest in geography. \n\nI know that I have to ask from God too, but I just wanted to hear from you guys on your opinions. What do you think? I might drop geography and replace it with economics if I really do not want to continue taking geography."

The problem us that I don't want to carry a Laptop and a tablet with me.\nI need a device to take handwritten notes with but it should also be able to run java code. I know that VS Code runs on Chromebooks but google removed java support because it's \"insecure\".\nI know that a windows device would probably be best for me but, and I am sorry but this is my opinion, windows is not a great operating System.\nI really like Linux and it should theoretically work to Dualboot Linux on the Lenovo Duet 5, which I am currently interested in buying but I don't know whether it's worth the risk.\nWhat do you think and which device would you recommend? \nDo you have any experience with coding Java on Chromebooks?\n\nI already used an iPad and a Lenovo Duet but I am not a fan of Apple and I couldn't find any app that let me scan documents and take notes on them. Scanning PDFs with my phone and sharing it to my Chromebook, only to have to import each page manually just seems too inefficient.\nI bought nebo and tried almost every app out there.\n\nAndroid tablets are possible too. The Xiaomi Mi Pad 5 for example. Or even Lenovo's p12 pro\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/r0aaxi)"

So this probably wrong but  to me the name looks like Husaria which was also leaked during s0 (the leak: [https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/apex-legends-datamine-leak-1.png?resize=681,383](https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/apex-legends-datamine-leak-1.png?resize=681,383)) in the leaked picture the  same legend icon was leaked that is being used for gunzerker, also the person who leaked the image didnt know which legend icon belongs to which legend so that was just speculation meaning that the legend icon used for gunzerker could have been husaria.\n\n Leaked Husaria abilites:\n\n* **Passive:** *Shotgun Kick \u2013*\u00a0You have a shotgun on your leg that fires when you melee doors or enemies. Requires shotgun ammo. Using your abilities grants you a brief speed boost.\n* **Tactical:** *Flashbang* \u2013\u00a0Throw a grenade that briefly blinds and deafens opponents\n* **Ultimate:** *Concussive Breaching Charge* \u2013 Plant a breaching charge that fires a sonic wave through walls to destroy traps, force open doors and disorient enemies.\n\n Before anyone says that it was leaked during s0 meaning that all abilities are probably scraped I would like to point to Seer who was leaked during s0 but still has the same tactical as when leaked, or revenant who has same ultimate and etc. So im guessing but the team probably selects 1 ability passive, tactical or ultimate and goes from there, so if I had to guess only thing that could stay the same is their passive (Respawn said that they dont want flashbangs and stuff in game so no for that and her ult has low chances of being added because its simmilar to cryptos ult)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsh:\n\nAsh might come really soon since she is getting a lot of lore recently.\n\nOnly leaked stuff we have for ash is some stills from when one of the devs acidently streamed and on animation leaked by someone who leakes where she pulls out her sword (I cant find the animation)\n\nBlisk:\n\nBlisk was also leaked during s0 and was also leaked on the character testing sheet (the sheet: [https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends))\n\nBlisk abilities:  \n\n* Passive: Interrogation \u2014 Executing an enemy will reveal the location of their allies for 10 seconds.\n* Tactical: Throwing Knife \u2014 Deals 20 damage and marks the target. Killing a marked target rewards double credits.\n* Ultimate: Payday \u2014 Squad kills award credits. Spend credits on powerful supplies.\n\nProbably only thing same on his kit is his passive everything else is probably scrapped because of the replicator.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is all speculation and is probably wrong."

One day I ended up blurting this out to my mom and she was pretty accepting, i asked her not to tell anyone until i was ready and she seemed to understand. However, a few months later i noticed my dad looking at me weirdly and the next day he really kindly said that he loves me just as he did before, then he told me that my mom told him. I confronted my mom about this but ended up shrugging it off since my dad was so kind about it, just telling her not to tell anyone else. But then at the latest gathering she told her entire side of the family. This time i was really upset because i felt like she disrespected my wishes but when i explained this to her and asked her to apologize she started crying about how she didn\u2019t understand how her telling them was wrong and that it was really rude of me to hide this from the family because they\u2019ve all responded very kindly which is true and she felt bad that she was keeping secrets from the family. Now i am unsure if my angry reaction to her was warranted when she only wanted to be truthful. AITA?"

You could present inattentive and also feel hella wired all the time, but only express that in any way when you're by yourself, for example.\nI like that this still acknowledges the different ways ADHD can manifest, since it diminishes the risk of someone being overlooked, while also taking into account that you can't really tell what a person with ADHD experiences from looking at how they behave.\nThank you for coming to my infodump :)",

Only awareness of this pattern may cause the pattern to be (even if momentarily) disturbed and create room for an escape from it. This is why we practice, not just to reduce our own suffering, but to weaken the entire structure of greed, aversion and ignorance for the sake of all living beings.\nMy advice would be to regard this situation with compassion and to see it as motivation to, in so far as you are able to, further uproot the greed, aversion and ignorance that are at the basis of these types of occurences.",

                "body": "Hi y'all,\n\n(Scroll down for TLDR-summary)\n\nToday I had my last diagnostic appointment and am finally looking forward to getting help for my crippling ADHD. I'm 20 years old and have already suffered way too much from the condition, so getting help has been a very emotionally intense experience.\n\nMy parents would always discredit me when I mentioned maybe wanting to get help, telling me that I should get through difficult things on my own. Other classics include: \"You're just a dreamer and didn't really want to pay attention, you were just more interested in other things, you're just lazy\", I'm sure a lot of you know the drill. Lately they've started to become more understanding, now that my suffering is more visible. \n\nI'll most likely be diagnosed with predominantly inattentive ADHD and I have mixed feelings about that. I used to adopt a lot of what my parents said about people with ADHD when I was a teenager and became very bitter towards the idea of people with ADHD getting extra time for tests and such, because they were \"just dreamy\", like me, and it was unfair that they got an advantage (because I didn't deserve one either). I really hate this mindset now (pretty sure I always did, but I still adopted it as a way to protect myself from being hurt by it), but I still hold internalized bitter feelings like this and feel like I'm afraid that I STILL won't take myself and my problems seriously enough if I'm \"just the dreamy type\". To clarify: I think I'd take myself more seriously if I got diagnosed with ADHD-C, even though I know rationally that that's absolute bullshit. I notice that I'm still very hurt about not being taken seriously by my parents and that I'm very anxious about not getting recognition for my suffering. I know it'll get better and I really trust the professionals who've helped me so far, which is great, but I really wanted to talk about this in case anyone else here has had a similar experience (which I think is very probable, haha). So: have any of you also had difficulties with accepting the fact that you're \"just the dreamy type of ADHD\"? And what are your experiences with learning to take your own problems seriously and to stop thinking that you don't deserve any help?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; At 20, I finally almost have my ADHD diagnosis: most likely ADHD-PI. I still have internalized toxic feelings about ADHD-PI not being something to take seriously (because my parents always discredited my problem) and I'm really anxious about not getting proper recognition for my suffering, even though I know rationally that ADHD-PI isn't less serious than ADHD-C or ADHD-HI. My question for you is (for the ADHD-PI folks): have you also had difficulties with accepting the fact that you're \"just the dreamy type of ADHD\"? And for all of you: what are your experiences with learning to take your own ADHD seriously and to stop thinking that you don't deserve any help?"

                "body": "In the previous series (Naruto), Naruto's and Sasuke's tandem worked out as the Ashura and Indra because of their almost absolute contrasts, despite being equals in power. Naruto is the loving extrovert of the two, so it was natural for him to lead people (Ashura). Sasuke had childhood trauma and is the logical introvert, so it was natural for him to be the shadow (Indra).\n\nThe current series seems the same in that aspect. It has been consistently shown that Boruto has Ashura-like qualities. He draws people towards him (Shikadai, Inojin, and other classmates, the Daimyo's son), he is even Mitsuki's 'sun' (as opposed to shadow), and I think he has the biggest contribution to imparting the concept of brotherhood to Kawaki, just like what Naruto constantly did to Sasuke. Meanwhile, Kawaki, having a harsh childhood like Sasuke's, was already set to be the Indra.\n\nThis leads us to a crucial difference between Boruto's and Kawaki's Ashura-Indra synergy: Boruto wants to be a shadow when Sarada finally achieves her goal to become the Hokage. And I thought that one way to resolve this issue in the manga's ending is to push Boruto into a corner where he'd either lose something big , or sacrifice himself for the sake of others. This would make sense:\n\n1. We've already seen him sacrifice himself after knowing that he nearly killed his father.\n2. By sacrificing himself, Momoshiki will finally cease to exist. And he'll probably see another contradiction between how Otsutsukis and humans deal with problems.\n3. Boruto's bloodline (Minato Namikaze) and those close to it (i. e. Jiraiya) already sacrificed themselves for the greater good.\n4. As Boruto stated in the beginning of the manga, his story is gonna be different to that of his father's, so sacrificing himself would be a nice contrast.\n\nTbh, me thinking about a future scene wherein Sarada becomes Hokage and Boruto as a shadow reminded me of the last time Tsunade (as the 5th Hokage) saw Jiraiya (the shadow) before he departed for his mission to Amegakure. (Or that moment might happen even before Sarada becomes the Hokage.)\n\nSo there. I'll be happy to know your thoughts."

Buy some at your local pet store, stick them in an air tight container with a lid, or a jar with a piece of fabric and a rubber band around it, and put a about an inch of dirt/potting soil. You can even let the kids bring their own sticks and leaves from home or let them collect them from outside one day for them to put in the container (the isopods will eat and crawl on top of the sticks and leaves, and the leaves will give them somewhere to hide if they want privacy. You\u2019ll need one child to mist them each day, and have another different kid feed them each week with a fruit or a veggie. Amazing learning experience and they\u2019ll enjoy watching them roam around while misting them. Once you spray the inside with water, it kinda spooks them so they\u2019ll jump up and scurry under the nearest leaf. Extremely easy to care for and endlessly adorable imo.",

(I do think a lot and very aware of my environment and their values so when I was junior high or highschool, I don't just go hug my classmates because it was deemed to be a gay/weak act, and hugging a girl is out of the question)\n\nMy outlet is a dog. I want affection and attention from dogs. They are cute and I just wanna cuddle them stray dogs or not. Since it can be covered up by being an animal lover, I have easier time satisfying myself than doing it with humans which is impossible for my current state. Thinking about it again maybe this is the reason why I am an animal person.\n\nI am 22 years old now, I have a fear of commitment, I've never established any reliable relationship for my mental states. Thankfully, my parents are there to help by being dismissive of my emotional side and my mental, my problems, and my identity.\nI have no one to talk to yet I don't really want to call for help because it is a \"weak\" thing to do. (They do the usual NP things so imma skip them out)\nI am easily, undisputed the best English university student in my year and learn it by myself. I almost aced a very tough test that is called TOEIC while most of my friends got less than a half of the total score, all of this is somehow because my parents. And my mom always set a distance goal and provide me a support of 0 value for me to reach and If I succeed I'd be rewarded with stuff like PC but I don't know why I'm not motivated at all so she thinks its a good idea to motivate me by insult my identity and saying whats obvious and ridiculous \"You have no ambition at all by putting that knife onto a lower slot.\" \"Can you do stuff like to half of my level?\" \"You will never be on my level\" \"That is not how you should react to what I am saying!\" \"That is not how you respond to your mother!\" (After I responded by saying \"um\") \"You spent your entire life in front of a computer and you dont know how to solve this problem?\" (Then she provided me a youtube tutorial of what I just did, and i told her I just did it for the third time but somehow I just have to redo everything again for her sake because I don't know stuff apparently cause its annoying and irritating.) \"You should use your head more, be smart next time, you are ruining everything.\" (After I decided to not take advantages of other people by not lying.)\n\nI've thought about dying since I graduated (the first time being in between 5th - 6th grade). I got fired from work, getting devalued everyday... to the point I just gave up being myself. I'd just say whatever is fine, say things they want to hear, do things I hate.\nI don't remember when but there was a day I felt hurting myself mentally is enjoyable, it is like I'm heading to the goal, my very own first goal in life.\n\nAll of that plus all the mental stuff going on, my antisocial is getting worse, I act... inhuman.. I was told by my gamer friends, parents and irl classmates.\n\nIt is all pointless, I don't even know now why I write this long since nothing will get better. I think my parents really want me to die but they are morally held back. They lie, belittle, manipulate, and gaslight me all they like, stripped me off my privacy, cut off friends, never let me live by myself, and from doing something against their beliefs. All that but I can't bring myself to hate them. So I think ending myself faster, the quicker they will be happy. They will get by this loss and move on, this is the only major naughty thing I will do.\n\nThis is my first post ever on reddit, if it got taken down I will not bother.\n\n(Also one of the reason to justfiy my death is I am an unwanted child, a child outside of marriage, born out of immoral acts. Also life is beautiful, but it isnt my thing)\n\nI hope the next stage is giving up on my life and do it.\nBut before that I still want my first, and last hug from someone even if it is impossible since I got some of my parents bad stuff.\n\nThis is very messy but I hope you enjoy it, I do not want help too."

There should be consideration for any culture and to provide a respectful representation of it, especially if what's being pulled is monetized on top of the faulty representation. \n\nAs far as my opinion goes, culture should be shared in good faith with others. It's how we connect and find common ground, and that should include ceremonial outfits. What should be discussed is what designs could be used as inspiration, like how Scotland has a set of \"common\" tartans that can be used by any fashion house. The tartan pattern doesn't mean anything, but the design is similar enough to draw inspiration. If there were a series of designs and clothing from a general Indigenous concensus, then maybe that could alleviate the thought of cultural appropriation.",

                "body": "Hi there!\n\nI'm fairly new to the World of Darkness and to Vampire: The Masquerade. I have found myself deep into TTRPG TikTok, and VtM really caught my eye. After doing some of my own research, I found that people either used the V20 edition or 5E. I decided to purchase the V20 book, and I saw a picture located on page 437. \n\nIt's of a man holding the traditional Rider-Waite card of the Wheel of Fortune. Who is he? Who does he represent? I've read around the picture about the Antitribu, but I can't seem to pinpoint who he would be, outside of a human witch or warlock. I'd think it'd be super cool to have a vampire who also dabbles with Tarot, what clan would be most suited to this? For the record, I'm White, so any bloodlines with ties to a (Western) marginalized group of individuals I'd feel funky trying to create a character with.\n\nLooking on the White Wolf Wiki, I came across the Verbena, but that belongs to another TTRPG called Mage: The Ascension. I'm stumped outside of that lead.\n\nThanks in advance!"

I'm either surrounded by friends and family or complete strangers when he shows up. He doesn't physically become visible without a phrase from spongebob \"i'm dirty dan\". But when the phrase is said, he possesses other people's bodies and forces them to try to commit suicide. The only way to fight him off is either i kill the goblin or the person afflicted puts on a suit and fidgets with something that needs both hands in order to keep themself from opening a window or grabbing a knife. \n\nThis isn't the first monster i've dreamed about. But this one definitely has a face and is a lot shorter than the demon. But the demon is a non-violent character in my dreams. He just sits there and watches things unfurl. This creature actively tries to harm others."

Didn't care the ability went off since the Sun Torkoal (already fainted) set was off. She didn't have any speed boosts either and proved not to be Choice Scarf by using different moves before switching in. I've got no clue how this happened, since, in normal circumstances, this shouldn't even be a speed tie, nor Sleep Powder has priority by itself or being used by Lilligant.

                "body": "Hi, I am a (almost) Vel'Koz OTP and been having trouble finishing games. I can play both Support and Mid roles and, in each of them, I feel there is only a certain extent I can impact a game. I am now at Silver but often play with some friends at Platinum level, so I am used to some aspects of the game, such as warding, positioning (still need to work a little bit on this one), trading, wave control (know the very basic, still need to learn to freeze longer times) and rotation to objectives. I do, however, get picked a lot on Mid by an enemy jungler, as I can't ward as much as a Support, so vision becomes a problem. In Support, even though I get a lot of lane control due to Vel'Koz's strong poke, often our wave gets pushed to their tower (I only hit the wave when I all in at 6 or when we want to recall), and this leads to a lot of ganks that, even if I ping my ADC, sometimes they just ignore me. I also have trouble carrying when fed, as even if i try to split to get towers or defend side lanes (mostly when Mid) while my team ARAMs mid, often they engage in futile fights I am not there to help. I used to run Teleport a lot, but as I was getting ganked often, I opt to choose Exhaust. In teamfights, even if I stay in the backline and build Zhonya's, they often dive me, turning the fight in a 4x5 with the highest damage dealer of our team, most of the time, dead. Finally, I've been getting a feeling Flex Ranked is so much easier due to the communication aspect, something I can't rely much on Solo Ranked as my pings are often unheard by my allies and they often don't ping.\n\nGiven all of this, what should I do to carry harder my games and rely less on luck of good teammates?\n\nOP.GG: https://br.op.gg/summoner/userName=Apollo027"
