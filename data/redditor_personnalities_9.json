                "body": "Yes, and V carries around a book of Blake's poetry. One of Blake's works is the book of Urizen.\n\nBlake was inspired by Milton's Paradise lost, which features Adam, Eve, and Satan in the garden of Eden. Eva is likely inspired by Eve in Milton's work.\n\nVergil and Dante are directly inspired by the Divine Comedy, particularly Inferno.\n\nIn the story, the Roman poet Virgil serves as Dante's guide through Hell. As he died before the time of Christ, he cannot pass on to Heaven. The real Roman poet Virgil greatly inspired Dante Alighieri to write the Divine Comedy.\n\nBeatrice, a stand in for Trish, is Dante's guide through Paradiso (Heaven). The real Beatrice was a woman that Dante Alighieri fell in love with at first sight, and she was an inspiration for his work Vita Nuova, and featured as a character in the Divine Comedy's Paradiso and Purgatorio.\n\nIn the Divine Comedy, there is also another woman along with Beatrice named Mary, which may correspond with Lady, who is really named Mary Ann Arkham. The third woman is Lucia, who shares a name with X (Chi) in the DMC series.\n\nAs for Nero, the Roman poet Virgil lived in the time of Augustus supposedly, and is depicted as accompanying him, Octavia, and Livia, and reading to them his epic poem the Aeneid.\n\nThe Roman emperor Nero was a descendant of emperor Augustus. The daughter of Augustus, Julia the Elder, was the great-grandmother to emperor Nero.\n\nAs for the Vergil-Nero connection, it is a bit of a stretch, but there is a story of Virgil and the basket, in which the poet Virgil is enamored with a daughter of the Emperor, hoisted up in a basket outside her window halfway. However, the Emperor's daughter is not interested in him, and leaves him there to be seen in the daylight and shamed.\n\nThe next morning, the Emperor sees Virgil disgraced and has him brought down to be killed for attempting to sneak into his daughter's bedchamber. Virgil escapes this fate by use of magic, which also sort of goes along with V using magic. There is a historical overlap between the Roman poet Virgil and the magician Virgil.\n\nPresumably, as the Emperor during Virgil's time was Augustus, and the only daughter of Augustus was Julia the Elder, Virgil may have had an unrequited love for her. As she later became the great-grandmother to Nero, this is the real Virgil-Nero srory connection.",

Mostly with them living up to the two faced stereotype, being addicts, crazy, unstable, or disloyal people. Most were male Geminis, one was a female.\n\nI'll start off by giving the disclaimer that I am Gemini rising, so I give off the same sort of vibe. For further context, my mom is an Aries and has always attracted Geminis.\n\nMy dad is a Gemini. A man who has played the role of a righteous family man while hiding a dark history of abusiveness, psychotic behavior, and substance abuse. My mom has a healthy suspicion he committed some serious crimes.\n\nMy mom's longtime ex was a Gemini and had similar issues except for that the persona he adopted was more of a tough biker. They met because he saved her from a crazy guy with road rage. He was also crazy and probably committed some crimes. He cheated on her and left her when she was pregnant. He also destroyed her property and jeopardized her health with drugged food and drinks.\n\nMy mom also had a chance encounter with a Gemini serial killer who took interest in her. She was lucky enough to get away without him being able to pursue her. He also had documented substance abuse issues and was similarly psychotic and aggressive.\n\nHer first boyfriend was a Gemini who was a bad influence. He wanted to keep their relationship a secret from his family and wouldn't back her up when questioned. He let her get shot by his brothers with pellets. He also loved drugs more than her apparently, so they broke it off.\n\nMy close male friend was a Gemini. After many years, he chose friendship with a guy who assaulted me, even after I warned him about what the guy had done. He betrayed my trust and I later found out he was making sexual jokes about me regularly. He turned heel to become a military man and Trump supporter, from being an internet troll and gamer as a teen.\n\nLastly, my grandmother was a Gemini. During my mom's childhood, she was a hypochondriac, Munchausen's mother, and pill popper. She let my mom be assaulted by her stepfather, disowned her for seeking help, and then used up her inheritance. She stole her paychecks. She tried to convince my mom to abort me and caused a car accident right before I was born. Afterwards she turned heel and was suddenly the best, most loving grandmother ever.\n\nAt least three were first decan Geminis, one was third decan, and the others I'm not sure. Has anyone else had similar experiences?\n\n**TL;DR: All five Geminis who have been close to me and my mom were or are awful people. The one crazy rando was also a Gemini.**"

It is a pretty aggressive Pomeranian mix. He and his wife like to take it with them everywhere and I worry that this could end in disaster if the pit bull was involved in an altercation with it.\n\nI also worry that with all the new people, sites, and sounds the dog could be triggered and attack. I don't want to see a beloved family member get mauled by her dog. I also don't want their pom to get eaten, like happened with someone my mom knows.\n\nI don't really think either of my cousins are responsible enough pet owners. My uncle (pom owner's dad, uncle to pit owner) used to train attack dogs for the police and is probably better at recognizing a dangerous situation and acting to diffuse it.\n\nThis is really giving me a lot of anxiety right now, and I'd rather not even go to the wedding at this point, but we have to because my aunt and uncle already bought us tickets to fly out.\n\nI have my fingers crossed that all goes well, but even then I worry for my cousin, her fianc\u00e9, and any children they might have together. My aunt also visits her pretty frequently, and I would be absolutely horrified if anything happened to any one of them.\n\nI just need some words of assurance and advice for how to best navigate this situation."

While this may disadvantage kid\u2019s who can\u2019t write quickly/all that well without revision, this would allow for a greater look at a persons natural writing ability, and the answers would likely be a lot more honest (since at this point your basically be expressing your exact thought process). \n\nAs far as logistics go, you\u2019d get the chance to redo you writing (with a different prompt), just in case you mess up, and would be able to submit three responses (you\u2019d choose which responses you\u2019d put forward, but theoretically will still be relatively unprepared each time). Obviously people could game the system and look up common prompts (the prompts being randomly chosen from a large prompt-bank) to prepare before hand, but in the end that\u2019s just missing the point. While this goes against the whole putting your best foot forward thing colleges like to tout essays as, it does allow for a more personable look at students, rather then the fake personas they make for themselves.\n\nAn example prompt would be:\nIf you were reborn as an animal, what would it be? Why?\n\nLike current essay prompts the purpose wouldn\u2019t be to gauge your academic ability, but your personality and natural writing ability.\n\nThis is just me positing a random idea though and is by no means a solution to college essays.

I try to talk sense into myself and try to understand that its not related, but then it takes over and i have to do it otherwise ill regret not doing it.\n\nI havent been officially diagnosed but i do suspect it.\nIts worth mentionig  that these behaviors carry on for like few months then stop because i get so tired and exhausted i cant keep up with them anymore so somehow i let them go... only to encounter them again the next year and get stuck in this loop for months. \n\nIf anyone needs further info to help im here just ask me.\nThanks in advance."

I've always considered animation to be the medium with the highest potential for pushing the envelope. Within the past few decades, there's been no shortage of artistic experimentation, dramedies with emotionally-satisfying arcs or period pieces which usually reflect on societal context in a broad fashion.\n\nHowever, there's been an ever-present lack of drama shows. I see *dramedies/comedy dramas* like Gravity Falls, Adventure Time or Avatar the Last Airbender as shining examples, though usually not any shows that are predominantly dramas through-and through.\n\nUsually when adults (usually in the 18-34 demographic) are looking to indulge in shows with copious degrees of emotional pathos, gravitas or tension--they typically just resort to a wide, ever-expanding list of anime--both seinen, josei, plenty of shonen, shojo or otherwise. We've always been an audience that shows an appreciation for cartoons, but never felt like it consistently fulfilled our interest in drama.\n\nI know that western animated shows are perfectly capable of being dramas--Batman Beyond and Spawn being prominent examples, though I just hope they'll be able to be given a larger scale in terms of production to satisfy the demands of the adults who value animated shows, including targeting through broad-mass appeal as well. Breaking this near-perpetual cycle could bring us substantially closer to outright dismissing the crude view that animation's exclusively intended for children, along with providing a greater degree of variance in animated entertainment."

                "body": "As we all know, currently there's been a housing shortage ongoing for years on end--even on an international scale. Before I go into how to remedy the present issues, first let's go over some of the issues:\n\n* While the [rebounding housing market](https://www.curbed.com/2018/6/19/17476360/housing-market-rebound-inequality-harvard-state-of-nations-housing) has led to the proliferation of more housing starts and more apartment buildings breaking ground, a persistent labor shortage has been responsible for driving up costs and cutting into margins for these projects, adding to significant economic pressure for developers to focus on luxury units, which can turn a higher profit.\n* Factors such as low unemployment, alongside federally-enacted efforts to[ drive up deportations](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-benefits-exclusive/exclusive-trump-administration-proposal-would-make-it-easier-to-deport-immigrants-who-use-public-benefits-idUSKCN1S91UR) and curtail immigration (keep in mind that immigrants make up [25 percent of the sector\u2019s workforce](https://commercialobserver.com/2018/07/on-thin-ice-how-trumps-immigration-stance-is-impacting-the-construction-industry/)), and the construction industry\u2019s growth over the past several years have led to preventing contractors and developers from keeping track of rising demand.\n* Hurricanes Irma and Harvey each created increased regional demand for home builders. In the spring of 2019, [nearly 250,000 construction jobs](https://www.bisnow.com/houston/news/construction-development/americonstruct-ceo-neil-lockhart-talks-construction-hiring-trends-98263) remained unfilled across the country. According to a Build-Zoom analysis, the job market is [tightest in high-cost markets](https://www.buildzoom.com/blog/scar-from-which-the-construction-workforce-has-yet-to-recover), which generally have the greatest need for affordable housing.\n\n>**Zoning regulations**:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Current problems: Local zoning regulations prohibit building anything other than single-family detached houses on [three-quarters](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html) of land in most U.S. cities. Townhouses, duplexes, and apartment buildings are usually considered illegal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* By using local government authorities to zone out lower-income families, upper middle class Americans protect the value of their homes.\n* (Federal policy helps, of course, by [regressively supporting richer home-owners through mortgage interest deductions.](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/THP_15WaysFedBudget_Prop8.pdf))\n* Restrictive zoning codes often dis-incentivize new construction and, additionally, densification, which leads to the suppression of housing supply even as demand rises. Whether by limiting the height of new buildings or deciding that large apartment buildings need a [minimum number of parking spots](https://la.curbed.com/2017/7/21/16011386/parking-lots-bad-los-angeles-development), these restrictions make construction typically more difficult and more expensive. California cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco are known for impeding new construction through these methods, which has helped lead to [the state\u2019s severe housing shortage](https://www.curbed.com/2018/5/4/17317362/california-housing-crisis-affordability-report).\n\n*Solutions!* :\n\n>**Universal Housing Vouchers**: Expanding housing subsidies, like [vouchers](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/hcv/about/fact_sheet) or the [National Housing Trust Fund](https://nlihc.org/explore-issues/projects-campaigns/national-housing-trust-fund).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* We already have a system for helping low-income renters through the federal [Housing Choice Voucher Program](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/hcv/about/fact_sheet). Unfortunately, because of lack of funds, only [one in five households who qualifies for housing assistance receives it](https://www.urban.org/node/95616). If housing assistance were available to everyone who qualified for it before the pandemic, managing a sudden income loss would be easier to navigate. Households would simply provide documentation to public housing authorities, and they would adjust the rent. The government would make up the difference, protecting the renter and landlord from loss of income.\n* The simple solution of making Section 8 Housing Vouchers completely universal through government subsidization could widely expand housing accessibility along with having a fiscally stimulating effect as well.\n* Joe Biden even has a [detailed outline for this specific housing proposal](https://www.vox.com/2020/7/9/21316912/joe-biden-housing-plan-section-8).\n\n>**Up-zoning+ Land Value Tax: --**\n\nLVT would be significantly cheaper to collect than other taxes and, unlike VAT, NICS and PAYE, since it does not impose collection costs on businesses. On top of this, and as it's been noted at various points, it's an unavoidable tax. Offshore trusts and wealthy non-residents, the owners of much of the available land would subsidize federal government through payment contributions.\n\nResource rents are created by the community or given by nature. If the Government collected a Land Value Tax (LVT), levied on all sites according to their optimum permitted planning use, landowners would be encouraged to utilize empty sites themselves or transfer by sale or lease to others who would put the land into use. This would allow for more job opportunities and wealth along with avoiding urban sprawl. These would change incentives for owner-occupants of large single-family homes in expensive locations. Zoning reforms that allow higher density housing would increase land values and, under land value taxes, yield higher tax bills.\n\n* Land\u2019s typically most expensive in [city centers](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=sDb7fZyn4PIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA821&dq=alonso+mills+muth&ots=poaYh43lIN&sig=koBy24HeBakPNKiQpgODjXCy2c0#v=onepage&q=alonso%20mills%20muth&f=false), near job clusters and transportation nodes. Land value taxes primarily change financial incentives for owners of [expensive land](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12061-009-9039-3) with low density structures. The increased density encouraged by shifting to a land value tax would enable more people to [live near work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119009000576), which would reduce commuting distances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Housing First-Initiatives:** Another issue meant to be tackled amidst the various housing crises across the world concern the prevailing epidemic of homelessness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The Housing First approach focuses on providing immediate, safe, and affordable housing without requiring its residents to adhere to preconditions such employment or sobriety before gaining access to stable housing. Rather, this model stabilizes patients in a housing setting, making it much easier for them to obtain services that are made readily available to residents and built into the supportive housing framework\n* The HF participants \u201creported greater gains in quality of life, and demonstrated greater improvements in community functioning compared with participants in treatment as usual.\u201d \u201cThese findings suggest that a majority of individuals with severe mental illness who are homeless are able to move immediately into and manage their own housing if given the right support,\u201d writes Aubry.\n* [HF research article](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/housing/chronic-homeless-housing-first-research/#:~:text=The%20HF%20participants%20%E2%80%9Creported%20greater,to%20move%20immediately%20into%20and)\n* The 2013 Patterson study in *Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology*, notes significant increases in quality of life for participants after both six months and one year, compared with standard interventions.\n* There are numerous lessons to be learned from the covered overview. The first, and most important, is that HF is very successful, most especially regarding the primary outcome of enabling people with a mental illness who are homeless to find and maintain stable housing for an extended period of time.\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4679126/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4679126/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Social Regional REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts):** These are known as trusts which invest in apartment complexes, duplexes and other forms of rental properties and ensure they stay affordable for recipients and nearby-residents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Certain trusts have committed to having investors seek to acquire market-rate, class-B multifamily properties and reposition them in order to suit higher-income renters. The properties in question have tended to become a source of affordable housing for moderate income families who don\u2019t qualify for any sort of rental assistance that even lower-income beneficiaries are.\u00a0\n* Federal governments can further subsidize the creation of REITS through contractual agreements and has REITS being allowed the opportunity for both equity investments in acquisitions or developments such as making or buying mortgages used.\n* Such examples include the [Community Development Trust alongside other trusts](https://www.reit.com/news/reit-magazine/may-june-2019/social-purpose-reits-tackle-affordable-housing-challenges) which has led to having \"created or preserved more than 47,000 units that provide homes to nearly 120,000 residents in low- and moderate-income communities. The company seeks to invest in properties where at least half the units are rented to families earning no more than 80 percent of the area median income.\"\n* Other trusts include UMH which has offered \"high-quality, low-cost housing for families earning just $30,000 to $50,000 per year.\"\n* The article in question also notes: \"REITs that own manufactured home communities play a vital role in the affordable housing market, Pawlowski says. He notes that they serve a wide range of lower-income Americans\u2014from boomers who have downsized, as is the case with **Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc**. (NYSE: ELS), to blue-collar families having difficulty saving for down payments, as with **Sun Communities, Inc**. (NYSE: SUI). \u201cManufactured housing is one of the most affordable types of rental shelters you\u2019ll find anywhere in the country,\u201d he says. \"\n\nAs we've seen, through an effective combination of strong housing subsidies, Trusts, and comprehensive zoning reform, we should be able to properly remedy the problems regarding affordable housing.

The place I bought the Hanami\u2019s only had carpet and they felt fantastic, alas I feel like either the shape of the pad or the pad thickness under the ball of my foot is interfering with my balance.\n\nI really feel like the padding makes me tilt forward ever so slightly. My relev\u00e9s always felt so sturdy on the Juliets, I feel like I became a klutz who lost all her balance when I use my Hanami\u2019s :(\n\nAny tips or recommendations??"

Fami maybe knows of War\u2019s goal of wanting to fight CSM, and so she engineers situations that will lead Asa to fight Denji. \n\nThe irony of her desire is even if they did love her, she may never feel full because she feels neglected and so she just gives and gives and gives, never understanding that all she needs to do is to love herself first. She is unbalanced as her own tilted head and earrings that look like scales. \n\nWith this I think her power is maybe something like the amplification of others powers but maybe at a cost."

Ironically despite Morj saying shes done in the story, his video here on how newer SHs join is still very relevant here with Carrot. It seems pretty obvious Carrot was the 10th member planned since the beginning of One Piece. I think that number changed to 13 midway in the start of the story and now the 13 prediction will come true. Vivi is coming soon to be the 13th and I think Bonney is not joining and Hancock will be the 12th still imo:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va\\_HgI7KQbM&t=655s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va_HgI7KQbM&t=655s)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/wuwi9t/new\\_prediction\\_theory\\_the\\_last\\_3\\_straw\\_hats/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/wuwi9t/new_prediction_theory_the_last_3_straw_hats/)\n\nJust my predictions on how it was gonna go about was wrong and its being delayed, but I still think it'll happen. All 3 of the chars are back very relevant in the story and got focus and mentioned by Oda in past interviews. Hancock is saying things like if I stay on this island the marines will keep coming, then I better marry and see Luffy. And her Seraphim keeps getting major focus more than the rest.",

I wont say much, just wanted to say go back and rewatch Seaosn 5 of My Hero Academia. If you think Season 6 is amazing and highly anticipating the 2nd half cour of the season, go back and rewatch the arcs and season that took the time to properly setup this entire masterpiece season your watching right now and witnessing. The war arc was taken well by the anime only community and thats great to see and of course without spoilers theres more to come with this 2nd half that the manga readers know without saying anything. Like any proper story is well written and told, the season 5 content properly setup everything your seeing in Season 6 today.\n\nSo I would go back and pay attention to the episodes of Season 5 more closely and see how those character development moments and setup parts for the characters and story built up everything for the amazing payoff your seeing now. Its not just the whole series which is true but also especially season 5 in particular. S5 got alot of flack without all of it being warranted or necessary. Yes they switched the arcs and they cut content and things could be better, but S5 was still a great season overall and still one of the best seasons in my book. Its a middle of the ground good season overall and better than season 4 in my opinion at least but that arguement is besides the point.\n\nGo watch season 5 again, you might appreciate it more if you do now. Just marathon it, sub or dub. And youll realize the little nuggets preset and setup then and say things like \"dang they really did set this up properly all back then\" People take things for granted every day, but I truly believe stuff like Season 5 will be more appreciated in this crazy fanbase sometimes in the long term. Thats all I had to say, good day everyone. And happy season 6."

Instead of punishment, the dead are classified into six houses in heaven based on the sins they chose to pay or live with what they committed.\n\nWe arrived first at the house of **lust**;\n\nHouse is a misleading term; it was more like a field spread out over acres and acres of lush forest. There was a white sand beach in the clearing full of couples copulating, small huts scattered all the way from which orgasmic moans regularly arrived. Men with defined abs and women with ample breasts strolled around without even noticing me and God. They only had eyes for each other; tickling and pinching each other with flirty giggles.  \n\n\n\"What do you think?\" God asked as we walked down a huge path to a champagne pool, small cherubs flying on top, armed like happy cleaning supplies.\n\n\"Lust is our most popular sin.\"\n\nI looked at the couple-like figures passing by and could easily see why.\n\n\"You can look for as long as you want here, man or woman.\"\n\n\"Come on...\"\n\n\"Here you can be any gender you want in a snap of your fingers, no fetish is too taboo, and no desire can be denied here.\"\n\nIt was very tempting, but I wasn't ready to make a permanent decision here.\n\n\"Let's see the others!\" I said to God.\n\nWe moved on to **greed**; we passed rows and rows of mansions, each more opulent than the other, some so large they would have enough rooms to accommodate my entire hometown, and so many different styles. In one second we were in a beautiful French vineyard in front of a beautiful castle with the Alps in the background, in the next second, a hot tropical beach with a modern mansion on breathtaking cliffs. After that, a ski chalet in Colorado with a crackling fire, a fireplace big enough to fit a bull, each had several Italian sports cars and Rolls-Royces parked out front with occasional handfuls of boats, helicopters, etc.\n\n\"Any material desire you've ever wanted,\" explained God, \"your own world where you can have everything. Do you want diamonds? You can fly to Washington in your own solid gold helicopter and buy them at the Smithsonian. In fact, you can just buy the Smithsonian.\"\n\nAlso tempting, but I decided to keep exploring the others; **gluttony** was next. Tables and tables of the finest foods, beautiful rare cooked steaks, buttered lobster tails, fresh oysters in a half shell, exotic wines in dusty bottles hidden in the cellars of the world's best restaurants. They all had a glass of champagne in their hand and simply rested on sofas and chairs near the tables, eating nonstop. As soon as the inhabitants took a bite, the food instantly returned; my mouth watered just watching them.\n\n\"In all the other houses, the food is practically sawdust compared to gluttony,\" explained God. \"You haven't truly experienced heaven in your tongue until you've gone to gluttony.\u201d\n\nI shook my head and we kept moving. **Sloth** was as you would expect; an infinite sea of soft mattresses, filled with pillows and cushions that would make the story of the princess and the pea seem minimalistic, angels visited each resident giving them massages that made them melt into their blankets\u2026\n\n**Wrath** was, well, much like what I expected hell to be; fire, sulfur, whips, torture... you know, the works, except here you weren't the one being tortured. every enemy you ever made in your real life was now at your fingertips\n\n\"Many people choose their parents,\" explained God. \"Many resentments towards parents in general, you know, but you're not limited to that... someone stole that job promotion on earth? you can get revenge here.\"  \n\n\nThen we got to **envy**; it looked pretty much like my house.  \n\n\n\"Go ahead,\" God said, pointing to the door.\n\nI turned the handle and went in and found her waiting for me inside. She ran up to me, put her arms around my neck, and planted a kiss on my lips.\n\n\"Welcome home, darling!\"\n\nI looked back at God.\n\n\"Don't be shy,\" he said. \"You can't keep secrets from me. We all know you were in love with your best friend's wife.\"\n\nShe didn't seem to hear him at all. She went back into the hallway.\n\n\"We both know you ended up choosing your own wife while secretly longing for Emily. Well, this is your chance to live happily ever after.\"  \n\n\nI looked to the kitchen. Emily was cooking something, wearing only an apron, her black curly hair falling softly over her shoulder as she beat the ingredients. She turned, noticed me watching, and a thrilled smile spread across her face. \"It's what you always wanted, isn't it?\" God whispered in my ear, and I wanted to accept it. I really wanted to accept it, but I shook my head. God looked intrigued.  \n\n\n\"Hey, you need to make a decision,\" he told me.\n\n\"Well, I haven't seen **pride** yet,\" he taunted. \"No one ever wants pride, trust me.\"\n\n\"Well, I want to see what it's like,\" I said.\n\nPride seemed boring, just a row of workbenches in an empty white room.\n\n\"Well, I don't understand,\" I said to God.\n\n\"Yeah, no one does,\" he replied. \"That's why no one ever chooses pride. Doesn't sex in lust sound better than staying here building little trinkets for eternity? Wouldn't you rather gorge daily on the best food you could imagine in gluttony, or spend time with Emily in envy?\"  \n\n\nI reconsidered the options.\n\n\"I choose pride,\" I finally told him.\n\nHe narrowed his eyes.\n\n\"Why? Come on, look at this...\" he gestured around the room again. There wasn't much to look at. \"Why would you choose this for eternity?\"\n\n\"Why don't you want me to choose it?\" I said to him. If he was really God, he would know how stubborn I can be, and I knew he was hiding something, pretending that pride didn't exist. There was something special about it. God made a face back at me, then he led me to one of the workbenches in the center. There was a black space, a strange void that lasted forever.\n\n\"So here's your universe,\" he said. \"You have seven days to start.\" He sat on the bench next to me and went back to messing with his own world. After a long pause, he finally spoke again.\n\n\"You know, it might actually be good for me to have some company for the first time...\""

But 4 is much more common among Feelers than it is among Thinkers, that much is indisputable. It's just more common among Fi than any of the other functions. \n\nIn PDB I've seen people make literal claims that INTJs are incompatible with 4 due to these misconceptions despite the presence of a tertiary Feeling function. The same people also acknowledge the compatibility of ENTJs with Type 8; which they commonly associated with Se, the ENTJ's tertiary function; so they are literally contradicting themselves without using logic in most cases. \n\nThat being said, the only types that wouldn't make sense with a Type 4 would be dom-Te users because they're utilitarian approach to life tends to contradict the more withdrawn, emotional nature of the Type 4. \n\nAmong the Withdrawn types, I could see an ENTJ being a 5, but not a 4, if that makes sense.",

Right off the bat, I gotta tell you that it's unrealistic to lose 24 pounds (11kg) in 2 months at our height and weight along with it being extremely bad for our health.\n\nSlow and steady wins the race. Before, I too wanted to shed off the pounds quickly and just ended up gaining more in the process of restricting and binging cycles. My hair started falling out and I developed acid reflux. One day, I decided it didn't matter how long it took, but as long as I was losing even .01 pounds a week I would be happy because it would all add up in the end. It's taken me 7 months to go from 72kg to 67kg just by staying in a deficit every week and my outlook on food has changed for the better! The first few months, I was terrible with binging and went significantly over my daily 1500 calories, sometimes consuming over 4500 calories in a day. But, I'd always manage to make up for it the other days and still be in an average deficit at the end of the week. Also, if I decided to have a low-calorie day, I made sure I NEVER went under 1000 calories per day because research showed that going under this amount for women at our height could stunt growth/development.\n\nOver the course of these 7 months, it may look like I only lost 4.5kg (10 pounds), but I've learned to listen to my hunger cues, not shame myself for indulging, go for walks not to lose weight but because I enjoy them, eat foods that don't trigger acid reflux, and my periods are no longer irregular.\n\nI hope to post a thorough analysis of everything I learned throughout my process once I reach my goal of 128 pounds (58kg), but saw someone starting at a similar place I did and couldn't help but respond :)",

Ti is directed intrinsically, so learning becomes very personal to the individual who has this function. Ti users love delving into topics they're passionate about. I would even argue that Te users at times have the sheer will power to push through and do something just to get it done. I know an ISTJ who will complete a task even if they don't feel like doing it, while an INTP won't do something if they don't see any intrinsic value in it. \n\nAdditionally, the Te users who learn for the sake of achieving which OP is talking about I'm assuming are the overachieving Te types who tend to be INTJ and ENTJ. Their Ni makes them very self-critical and combined with Te they love to push their limits. ISTJ's and ESTJ's can be workaholics too, but they won't step out of the boundaries they've created for themselves while with INTJ's and ENTJ's there really isn't a limit.",

But I will cry if I see any sad movie and I even almost cried in Frozen if that tells you anything.\n\nNow, I'm not ruling Fi out of the picture, but not being able to pinpoint emotion is more of a Ti thing. I'm an INFP, and though I may hide my emotions from others, I generally have a good idea of how I feel about something. It comes more as a gut-instinct, so a lot of my Fi judgment comes from if something feels right or wrong.\n\n>I take a long ass time making decisions. I like to think things through, but if I've already thought something through then I'll be there fastest decision maker out there. But most of the time I need some time to think about if I really want to pursue this. I usually make a pro and cons list.\n\nEveryone has emotions, but cognitive functions are based on the order they come into the main picture when making decisions. All your decisions seemed to be based on weighing pros and cons and if there are consequences or not. A Fi user is going to struggle with making decisions on things they're not familiar with because the decision has to feel right. I remember I was discussing career choices with an INTP and we were at disagreements because the INTP thought I should value the return value, while I was looking at if that career was the best choice for me in terms of personality and what I wanted for myself.",

                "body": "Hmm...They're definitely using a judging function if they're so caught up on achieving their dreams. Ni is directed intrinsically so these individuals can be super self-critical and constantly be thinking about the future. The funny thing is I know an INFJ who also has a lot of different interests and dreams, but doubts the fact that they are an INFJ.\n\nWhat sets INTJ and INFJ apart from INTP and INFP is how much pressure they put on themselves to achieve their goals. In both the INTJ and INFJ I've noticed that they'll beat themselves up over not being able to fulfill their expectations and push themselves even harder. The INTP and INFP on the other hand will completely try to avoid the thing that's bothering them until it all piles up into a snowball effect and they have to get the task done. \n\nThis doesn't mean the INTP or INFP can't be task-oriented as well. it also depends on the age and how much they've developed their other cognitive functions. For example, an INTP celebrity might act a lot like an INTJ over time simply because the stakes for their tasks are higher. (Not trying to confuse but just wanted to throw that out there lol)\n\nThis person OP's talking about would have had to always been task-oriented. If they were more \"go-with-the-flow\" in high school and have changed over time, then chances are they've either developed their other cognitive functions or are in the grip of their inferior function.\n\nI personally think based on the characterization it makes a really strong case for INTJ since they seemed to be workaholics from how you've described them and have an acute way of judging things with logic rather than their emotions for the most part. Instead of doing things for the sake of people, it's like the people are chess pieces who serve a purpose for their grand plan lol, which sounds a lot like how an INTJ would view their surroundings.\n\nHope this helps :)",

Or if I calculated that if something is worth the risk\n\nThat's a very ISTP thing to say, also an INTP would probably find a loophole around the rule instead of just breaking it.

Huntington beach is pretty close and I think it was the same species(i think, i might have pictures somewhere), same young age, and same location it was stuck in, namely the backyard.\nIt mde a ruckus flailing about and my dog was barking like nuts so we had to go check things out. My dog is more of a barker than a biter(when it comes to other animals, usually...), but still we got her inside and called i think an animal rehab center or something. They just told us to see if it doesn't leave on its own first. It was there for a couple of days sometimes standing on our chair outside and peering in with its intense unblinking hawk eyes. My dog pretty much ignored it and was only let out to use the lady's room under supervision.\nWe set up some ascending surfaces and eventually it tried some test flights and later just hopped up on the roof and took off! \n\nWe may have spotted it once or twice later on from far away, but you can't really tell from so far below them. Beautiful birds.\n\nThis was during the ***Great Plague*** and so the place we called may have been following different procedures and i don't remember if we even got a hold of specifically a rehab center so definitely call one and don't take my story as advice. They also told us no touching and no feeding, might be apparent but figured i'd mention it.",

Its not a test of how epically tough you are because this video everyone is scared of doesn't make *ME* scared. Obviously if you play a horror game and tell yourself its just a game the whole time and im not in danger because its a stupid game, then there is no immersion. If you don't have a bit of suspension of disbelief then the experience *CAN'T* feel real and you can't feel scared. If the creator has done a good enough job making it feel real and you are actually making an attempt to be immersed then the monster on screen can be real. If fake disfigured people were hunting you down and threatening you in ways you could barely understand, you would just be an idiot if you weren't scared. Horror media is a collaborative effort. You can dismiss a horror series as just a game or video or book, but in the end, you aren't looking for fear, you didn't conquer your terror, you didn't prove anything about how tough or cool you are.",

It was way more exciting than cereal or a bagel to me, exciting enough to want to wake up for, and according to her the smell would waft up to my room and get me to pop out of bed. She says that even after she stopped doing that, the habit was formed and she no longer had to fight a war to get me out of bed.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that would be reasonable since you also have ADHD, and that might make something like that too much effort first thing in the morning, but I think the basic idea of having something to get up for could be helpful, something that\u2019s immediate and not \u201cyou can do this later\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ll lose this privilege later\u201d. Something that feels exciting or novel could be a helpful motivator to get out of bed\u2014I find that I have a way easier time getting up at some wee hour in the morning for unique occasions like heading out on a family trip than I do waking up every day at a later hour for school.

I had no tolerance before. That was also my 1st ADHD treatment since im newly diagnosed. \nThe problem with it was that it didn't last very long regarding the focus, maybe 3-4 hours; 6 on good days. And 2 hours after taking it, as it would start to work, I would be yawning soo bad, and as the effect was disappearing with time, I would be going back to my normal self and feeling more energized.\nBtw it wasn't the kind of body-sleepiness but more brain-sleepiness? \n\nHad no trouble with sleep during the night. \n\nNow I'm taking Vyvanse 50 for the past 3 days and the sleepiness is gone (doesn't matter if I slept 5 or 10 hours the night before) AND what surprised me, I don't have the headaches if I forget to drink or eat enough.\nStill don't have sleeping problems - but maybe it's too early to tell.\n\nI'm just wondering why is this.

When I like a person (not romantically) I get too talkative with them and wanna know everything about them, which is bad when the person in question is the boyfriend of my (best) friend.\n\nI feel like I often seem flirty bc of that. \nLike I am very bad at small talk and usually seem very uninterested and then when someone exciting appears I am supper bubbly which will often give the wrong vibe. \n\nAlso, my sudden hyper urges that people cannot follow through. Like after a whole day of shopping, we are in the car and everyone is silent and tired and just wants to get home. \nBut I am excited bc I got to spend a day with the people I love and didn't get burned out bc of my meds. And there's the excitement bc of the people I love and the the extra excitement bc I dont have the irritation from a full day, so I become super hyper and my mind goes \" oh my God I did so much today and I don't feel bad because of it and now I wanna do so much more\", but my friends then get, accepteably irritated with me and tell me to shut up or something, and then I feel sooooo bad. \n\nLike I literally cried bc of that. But the problem comes that I understand where they come from, and I KNOW they don't hate me and I know my Personality is really exhausting, so I understand them. \n\nBut I also understand that this is how it's going to be with my life relationships, and this hurts me. I'm sad because I don't know how to control myself and understand that when we all had a nice day, that we all need a pause - but since that feeling of an accomplished day is rare for me, I need more of it, I need more if the gratefulness and success. \n\nAnd they know I have ADHD but I cannot use that as an excuse and can't except them to understand me. Or always use nicer words such as \"hey I know your excited, but could we please have some rest time\", bc I have the same problem with impulse reactions such as \"shut up\" . \n\nBut idk if it's normal for me to cry after such reaction? \n\nI'm mostly asking for advise on how to be more constant like them. How to understand that a long day, no matter how great it was, deserves rest. \nIt's just that, like I said, those great days don't happen often to me so i always want more, I can't get enough of them, or tired. \nThat was my dopamine and I don't wanna rest from it. \n\nI always had the problem of talking too much, laughing too much, being too playful, and I just can't stop when the rest of the group stops, so I end up being treated like that child at family gatherings that always asks 'when are we going home' ."

I researched all of those, I know I can  have enough self awareness to know that something doesn't fit with a certain diagnosis.\n\nThe 2nd one (psychiatrist) (the one who got me diagnosed) is a person specialised in ADHD, and he listened throughly what I had to say, was very understanding. 1st appointment I had with him was last week. 2nd one was today. \nI also did a question sheet today, and I had a nurse with me help me answer them, so that I wouldn't understand a question wrongly which would end in me having a symptom that I didn't actually have.\n\nThe 1st psychiatrists also made me do one - he didn't care to explain the questions form the sheet, and just based on that concluded I CAN'T have ADHD - basically told me, at the 1st appointment, to sleep through a bit and think more, so maybe I won't be thinking I have ADHD ( I can't explain the words since I'm using a different language, but he said it very ironically) . He also was insisting the question sheet is a 100% sure way to diagnose ADHD . \n\nThe 2nd one admitted that a lot of those questions are dumb, but he just had to have a physical evidence in a way of me having possible ADHD - AFTER he listened to me throughly and understood what I was talking about..\n\nAnd despite this, I feel I am making this up.\nI am not very sure why I am even writing this, maybe I need some sense knocked in, or wordS of encouragement... Esp since I can't tell anyone about the diagnosis  besides my online friend who encouraged me to get a diagnosis - she also has diagnosed ADHD."

When you\u2019ve lost a lot of weight already, your calorie intake should go down too.

Anyways please help!! \n\nMy mom is describing a short tv show or skit from the 1980s (possibly 70s). It was a cartoon of a little boy who solved problems and a light bulb would appear on top of his head. My mom believes he had a little bird friend and might\u2019ve lived with his grandpa. She said he didn\u2019t really talk much. \n\nThank you in advance!\n\nEdit: some more details, he was almost mute and when an idea would pop up he would kinda make a noise but no talking. The cartoon boy reminded her of caillou. Definitely a white kid with maybe blond hair? The show wasn\u2019t TOO long on tv but wasn\u2019t super short either. She said it came on in the morning, maybe 11am-12pm\n\nHe would be inside the house with his grandpa and then something would come up and that\u2019s when the bulb would light."

I kind of wished to get to that level of success and see my story go everywhere to hopefully do the same for someone anime did for me. \nPeople world wide love manga and anime, of all kinds, and it made me think that it would be awesome to have one of my own, specially since I\u2019d be doing something I genuinely love doing.\n\nYour point about webtoon being way more balanced is definitely true. The manga industry is cruel and for someone like me, it\u2019s probably almost impossible knowing even native men struggle to get there. As opposed to that webtoon is way more balanced and has a way wider range of audience with actually better money and less strict work schedule, which is why I have settled for that for now.\n\nKnowing all the trouble it has, I would settle for it if I had nothing to lose. But frankly I don\u2019t want to have to be under such pressure so I\u2019d lose my family, friends and even time to spend on myself. I want to enjoy my life as well which is why I\u2019m looking for an alternative.",

My art is actually good (I won\u2019t go ahead and say I\u2019m a professional but I got my wits about me) and have had a 20 year plan of how to get there.\n\nUntil recently when I met my boyfriend who lives in japan I have been hearing about how japan really works and I think with the racism and sexism and all the hard work and volunteer slavery it\u2019s just absolutely impossible for me to get there.\n\nI\u2019m from Iran and a girl and i have heard about what a bad time people from the Middle East may have in japan as well as how hard it would be for me to rock it in that industry as a woman even if I was Japanese.\n\nI only know a couple of women who actually got their mangas to be one of the top ones, whereas all the other huge manga artists are men and well, as we know they\u2019re all from japan.\n\nIt makes me feel really bad because I really wanted this job but I also don\u2019t want to sacrifice my whole life and not even be able to spend time with family or friends or even for myself knowing the unbearable schedules that these manga artists have. \n\nSo I\u2019ve been looking for an alternative that is quite alike and something that doesn\u2019t take away my everything in the process and I thought maybe you guys can recommend a couple or two that you may know.\n\nI\u2019ve also thought of first getting my story serialized on webtoon for now and then go on from there but I\u2019m not really sure where that path may go and if it will take me to the level of success I want to achieve.

Therefore, I usually have to excuse myself to get to those stuff, maybe even for long hours, and since our relationship is long distance and we usually only text, it\u2019s never enough.\n\nHe\u2019s said that he\u2019s unhappy with the amount of time that I spend on him. However, I spend all the free time I have on him, to the point where I haven\u2019t had time alone. And he understands that and has been really supportive of me. He still supports my work and is proud when I gain an achievement which is usually very refreshing and nice. Still, I wish to attend to his needs like he has with mine, because I really want this relationship to work.\n\nWe don\u2019t really know how to do that though.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019m here. Long story short, I need advice from you guys on how you guys have made yourselves satisfied with a long distance relationship? How did you guys spend the time you needed with each other and also on yourselves and your hobbies and work and keep it all balanced, and kept both of yourselves happy or satisfied?

                "body": "My dear People of the Chill, this relationship of mine with the MBTI community it's been a bunch of years of learning, self discovery and fun. But also a huge dissapointment.\nI want to tell the reasons why I left r/mbti and I would love to discuss about it with you guys.\nBefore I start I want to make clear that almost everything I'll say is based on my feelings and conclusions about it.\n\nI don't want to talk about these trending memes of family dynamics and all. I'd like to start by \"our\" problem with r/INTJ because I think it can be used as an amazing example.\n\nI feel like the whole MBTI community has idealized some types over others, being INTJ, INTP, and INFJ the most hyped. Why? I really feel that it is because they are rare, and therefore more interesting. Some people, then, may want to me be one of those types. The thing is that if you type by letters, it is easier to get an intuitive type (you already know that people believe that intuitve types are better, who the fuck knows why) than with cognitive functions. This is where everything starts.\n\nIf the letters give an intuitive type to a lot of people, it's not rare anymore, so you just discredit it in benefit of cognitive functions. What's so funny here is that, for example INTx types are supossed to be really rational types. Then, why BELIEVE so deeply these subjective, irrational ideas of cognitive functions that have never been proved and have 0 scientific base? Because you WANT a certain type. And vage descriptions and definitions are perfect for it. You just take those over simplified and subjective descriptions and explain them the way you want. That's why you end up with Ti being perfect logic machines, Ni as seeing the future, Fi being crying, Se being sporty and dumb, etc. And that's why you ignore 4 functions that also gave you a fucking score on a test! I always score higher on Ti than Ni, but nope: I'm not a Ti user, somehow. How do you explain this in a way that won't fuck your nonsense? You just say that all this can be understood as an spectrum and we are closer one to another? No. That's when you pull out the enneagram card.\n\nThis is all confirmation bias. It's the only explanation I can find to why would someone deny 16personalities' test, which uses Big Five, the only personality theory that's backed up by science. But no, it is bad because this guy I hate got INFJ, and he must be ISFJ because I'm smarter than him. But, dude, being special feels amazing, right?\n\nI think this all happened with the INTJs. It's all mistifyed, and misterious. \"One of the rarest\". A lot of people claim to be INTJ and behave like shit, to the point where I end up being ashamed of telling others I am an INTJ. \"Oh, he is one of those ISFPs that are pretenting to be INTJ\".\n\nI don't have a problem with nonsense, I can ignore it. But when nonsense is hostile, I'll get the fuck out of there.\nIt's sad, but I'm leaving. I'll stick to the memes, the letters and the Big Five.\n\nWhat do you guys think about all of this? Do you like the functions? I would really love to hear about it and about everything you want to say at this point."

Also, we formed a kind of cult around a cool teacher, we did a motion of no confidence against the class president and treated it like an important event, we had a \"rivalry\" (in a fun way) against a group of people that we considered a little bit cringe, and me and some friends managed to get a good grade with a random story of an obese, soccer-obsessed, doritos-eater, lazy dude who lived of subsidies and got a hair transplant as the last prize of a TV contest. Not everything was perfect, I have bad memories too, but comparing 8th grade with my shitty class of 10th grade, and how I feel most 16 years old are like (immature people trying to be cool and trendy who manage to know 500 people), dammit, I can't get anything but nostalgic."

I didn't bother with the second season because Ryu Hwa-young's character wasn't in S2 anymore except for a cameo and the actress for Yoo Eun-jae changed. I was weirded out I clicked off one minute in. (Side note: This was before Park Hye-soo's bullying scandal though and I personally don't feel comfortable watching bullies so good riddance I guess. Ryu Hwa-young's lowkey problematic too according to knetz but I can sit through her works + I'm not well informed about the whole T-ara fiasco to have an opinion.)\n\n\nMeanwhile, Welcome to Waikiki with different S2 cast worked because of its hilarious writing and the iconic Lee Jun-ki \u2014 these two factors hard-carried S2 for me. IMO Lee Yi-kyung outshined the other actors unlike in S1 where each character were memorable in their own way with Go Won-hee and Kim Jung-hyun particularly standing out for me.\n\n\nOn the other hand, cast change is more tolerable with dramas like Romantic Doctor and Partners for Justice where the foundation characters \u2014 Kim Sa-Bu and Baek Beom & Eun Sol respectively \u2014 do not change and a few minor characters remain. With that said, I am DESPERATE for a third season for both dramas.\n\n\n(I feel like I'm gonna get downvotes for that sidenote lmao. Idk if PHS and RHY are one of them but people on this sub do still idolize some actors/actresses that are \"problematic\", if you will but each to their own ig.)",

Also, it's heartwarming to see how the mentor-mentee (in both ways) relationship between the two develop into a friendship which allowed them both to grow.\n\nAs I've said, there's many lessons in this drama but one that will always stick to me is to do what makes me happy before it's too late.\n\nAnyway, give this drama a shot; you won't regret it!

At no point did I feel unsafe. Richmond homeless were actually really nice (saying that as a man; I understand it can be different for different people). A lot of them moved from various places across the country to Richmond. They have very interesting stories and occasionally very good sense of humor. I loved to help them out any way I could. \n\nMy apartment in DC is in the NW. Every morning I hear a crazy homeless person wailing or screaming at something. Harassing drivers, passers by, etc. it\u2019s always something new. There are some homeless people walking around or standing on every block. Some of these guys are extremely antisocial. Occasionally you hear of a homeless person attacking others on the street. There was a homeless encampment at McPherson Square which was recently removed, 74 residents. It is winter right now so not to many homeless people. But yes, they\u2019re a part of this city. They aren\u2019t very dangerous on their own, but sometimes you don\u2019t know what could provoke them. As mentioned, they\u2019re different than what I\u2019m used to. In general people avoid them.

I downloaded a torrent which contained all of Triple Js top 100 songs of 2009. Discovered Half a Glass of Wine. Watched the music video. I really enjoyed the song, but music like that was fairly common at the time. One day in 2010 I listened to the song again and discovered that Innerspeaker just came out a week earlier. I downloaded the album. I was blown away. The music the lyrics, it felt life changing. \n\nI talked to my friends about the band, and they dismissed it as some Beatles copy cat. At this time no one really knew anything about Kevin Parker. They thought the guy from solitude is bliss music video was the front man. They were interested in other bands at the time. When I played them, they made fun of the name Tame Impala and they were like what the eff is that even. I can\u2019t tell you how many people scoffed at the name. \n\nAnyway, I guess the truth is I\u2019m getting older, but it amazes me of the success of Tame Impala and how they were able to surpass other artists at the time. I was listening to NPR and they played tame impala as one of transition songs. This band has firmly established itself now. I always knew there was something amazing about them. They\u2019re still my favorite band of all time. I\u2019m really glad they are able to reach out to a new generation as well!

I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at so many anti smoking commercials but this one finally convinced me. \n\nI\u2019m five days into no nicotine. The withdrawal symptoms ended by day 3. I truly expected a lot more right? It couldn\u2019t have been this easy to get over something that\u2019s been controlling my behavior for 14 years. \n\nI\u2019m thinking that the greater issue has to be reflect personally about why one would get addicted in the first place. One thing I noticed from quitting nicotine, I seem to be eating a lot more. This shift to a different dopamine source makes me believe the battle isn\u2019t quite over just yet. \n\nBasically I believe the next step to quitting is addressing the core issues that drive you to engage in those addictive behaviors. Some issues I can think of that I will need to work on:\n\n1. I prioritize short term over long term, I don\u2019t even want to think about the long term\n2. There\u2019s a dissatisfaction with life, having a negative outlook. Some level of unhappiness with my current state\n3. Feeling like you\u2019re not in control of your destiny or even feeling out of control at some level\n4. Wanting to alter your state of mind to not feel emotional pain, believing you can self medicate to overcome these issues\n5. Not feeling like you fit in with the crowd, loneliness and resentment that comes with it\n\nFeels bad to admit this. But I feel like it\u2019s the first step after quitting. I encourage everyone to consider their emotional triggers and reflect on what makes you personally want to smoke or vape."

It all depends on you and how you try as an individual to genuinely look for someone who would sacrifice for you, and if they don't, there's no need to blame them. Move on, and don't let beauty or financial standards blind you from the reason of marriage which is beyond anything materialistic or satisfactory. It's finding home in someone when all the doors are shut.\nThat's just a 21 y/o, sickly optimistic and hopeless romantic man's opinion on the whole phenomena.",

I told him I have a cruah on him and he said he thinks I'm cute and pretty and that he's into me as well. Though he doesn't catch feelings easily at all, unlike me, and we have very different personalities, which is what draws me to him but also creats a big mess in my mind.\nFor me, when I have a crush on someone they become everything for me. I'm naturally both empathic and extraverted so my care taking tendencies are veey much shown in relationships. \nHe on the other hand is far more introverted and individualistic, and be needs more space for himself.\nI get it, it's understandable. Firstly I took it to heart but then I got to know him better and realised it's not about me.\n\nWe talk for less than a month, about 3 weeks and we met 3 times by now.\nHe has a lot of final exams at school lately so the last time was in last week's sunday. It's quite alot. \nYesterday I texted him after he finished one of his exams and I  was trying to cheer him up with some warm words because he said it went bad.\nHe left me on read for 4 hours.\nThen later he posted a story with his friend.\n\nI tried not to take it to heart but it did ruin my day. \n\n\nAfter that I felt so exusted that I really just felt like cutting this off. Not even so he'd feel sorry or anything, I'm juat exusted.\nI don't know how I feel exactly bc I jump into conclusions fast and my emotions are rathar ambivilant but it seems like I'm starting to feel like I want this to end more than I want him.\n\nThe thing is, whenever we meet or do video calls I regret wanting to cut off bc our communication face ro face is much better, but it seems like he doesn't care enough and it hurts. \nThat makes me feel needy and obsessive :/ \nI'm sharing this here because I'm sure there's something I'm missing and I'm tired of making impulsive desicions based on my hurting emotions.\nI did talk to him about this issue before, but I  didn't tell him everything I feel and worry about. I'm very scard he'll think I'm pushy and that I want too much from him too soon.\n\nWhat do you think I should do?"

Why? They don't contribute to anything, and it's going to start a trend of people doing utterly retarded shit for sweet orange arrows, not that they're not already doing it.Then we have the phenomenon of people milking a meme to beyond dead, and somehow getting it to thrive. How? How do you manage that? I'm still seeing the \"So how many times have you beaten cancer\" even though it stopped being funny 20 minutes after it started being a thing....Next on the list, we have the retarded fucking jokes like that all essentially follow the same format:\"She said \"i love you\" to me. Thank you person that isn't my girlfriend\", \"If anyone wonders why i have x application on my phone, it's because i support X\". They're essentially a copy of the same thing that may have been funny in its original state....Then we have the god forsaken girlfriend/crush posts... Boy, oh boy... It's essentially another way to gain karma, or just people using reddit for the same thing they'd use instagram for, but, when someone posts that type of post on instagram they're cringy and \"Nobody gives a shit\", yet here, the posts thrive because the majority of you are a bunch of hypocrites.\n\nSo, what's happened? Well, we had an epidemic of karma whores using illness as a means to gain the doots, and once we got rid of them, people changed their methods. Now it's all about getting to hot so OP can claim to do some dumb ass retarded shit they probably won't do. Now it's all about recycling that joke that worked one time because it was actually original. It's all about looking for an excuse to do X thing, and most times, the X is not even fun or funny \"I will purposefully stub my toe\", good job, you're a masochist, nice, but you're just removing the comedy from seeing people stub their toe, it's funny because it's accidental and the reaction is spontaneous.Any entertainment value in any of the posts that are originally funny is being removed by copycats. Now, why people updoot the unfunny shit? Idk, maybe they want those sweet coins, maybe it's moral licensing, maybe it plays into how much karma you gain from other sources. I don't know, but I see people complaining about it from time to time and every time they do, one of two things happens:  \n1.) They get a bunch of the unspeakable accommodation points and everyone agrees with them, yet nobody does anything to change the state of the sub.  \nOr  \n2.) They get obliterated with downvotes and they're a sad piece of shit."

Often accused of thievery and black magic. (Sterotypes include the gypsy fortune-teller with a crystal ball and exotic jewelry). They were travelling entertainers and craftsmen, and did have a niche as this. Thievery probably did happen, though no reliable sources can tell to what degree.\n\nAs societies specialized and travelling carpenters and such weren't necessary, the Roma grew increasingly poor and destitute. There are some people from my village who were given away by their Roma parents, since they couldn't take care of them.\n\nToday, they are seen as beggars and thieves, and... often are. They do beg, they are more likely to steal, they leave campsites ridden with trash. There's a lot of negative reinforcement, as they're forces into doing the things that make people dislike them. They're also a nice scapegoat or distraction for politicians who want support only by using words. Even if a group of Roma avoid stealing, they are generalised against, so that if another group steals, all of them steal, if you understand.\n\nThen there's issues within their own culture. They have a way of dragging each other down and they don't let their kids finish school. If you're a settled Romani, you don't want your seventeen cousins coming to your home.\n\nAlso they look different, which makes it easier to discriminate. There have been stories of children taken from their parents since they look more European than other Roma, making people think they've been kidnapped. (After DNA tests became common, this happens less often...)\n\nThey are everywhere, they belong to no single country, and they don't have their own voice. Few countries are willing to talk much about them. Settled Romani that could change the perception prefer to stay silent and hidden. I think this is why discrimination is still so common.",

This was very out of character for the channel and I was blown away, but after closer inspection, I'm unsure whether the numbers add up. I'm unsure how 153 subscribers can amount to $271 of earnings, giving me earnings of around $1.77 per subscriber. I thought the earnings from subscriptions were split 50:50 between the streamer and twitch, and given that a sub costs well over double $1.77 for the viewer, I'm left confused as to where the rest of the money has gone, especially as I'm further penalized when withdrawing the earnings on Paypal and currency conversion. I must stress that I am incredibly grateful for all the subscriptions during that stream, I'm simply creating this post as the numbers don't add up in my mind and I feel I should ensure there hasn't been a mistake. A small % change in earnings per sub makes a big difference with this amount gifted and since I'm not used to being gifted this much, I feel I have a bigger sense of responsibility on this occasion to make sure that everything adds up.\n\nThanks very much for reading and any advice you give will be greatly appreciated.

                "body": "So, are you happy with the Season 6 rewards that have been announced today? ([Here](https://twitter.com/rocketleague/status/1529145250559983622?s=21&t=GeQK4pzY0u2VNPdcg6-Kfg) if you haven\u2019t seen it already). Are you ever going to use any of these decals? Probably not, as most likely you were awarded with very similar decals a few seasons back. \n\nMuch of the community believe the rewards have become stale, however much of the community also argues that rocket league has a spoilt fanbase who are hard to please and that we should be happy with these season rewards. \n\nIn my opinion, the customer is always right. If players don\u2019t like the season rewards, there must be something wrong with them. With similar rewards season after season, of course the rewards are becoming stale.\n\nAre the season rewards really important? I think so. It\u2019s nice to get something in return for many hours put into the game and getting cool evidence of achieving a certain rank. I certainly think it\u2019s more important than adding an extra few items into the game that cost money.\n\nBut some say it\u2019s a business and adding new items is what will make them money. I agree it\u2019s a business, but satisfaction among players is a key ingredient in getting more people to play the game. Perhaps with more varied season rewards and more exciting game modes on the horizon, more people would be willing to play?\n\nAnd yes, perhaps the UE5 developments have reduced the amount of time that can be spent creating innovative new modes and items. However, I\u2019m sure if a roadmap was provided, many people would understand this. Without this, what most people see at the moment is a game with a declining player base, accentuated by the \u2018good\u2019 \u2018great\u2019 \u2018amazing\u2019 update.\n\nSo, with similar player rewards for around 20 competitive seasons and a declining player base, perhaps next season\u2019s rewards should be prioritised over having a 7th new item in the rocket pass. \n\nBut what new/innovative season rewards can there be? I agree that there\u2019s only a finite number of season reward ideas, but we\u2019ve now had similar decals and wheels as a season reward multiple times.\n\nPerhaps they could create a jingle for each rank that can be used as a player anthem ingame? For example, imagine getting [diamond](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx9s7BBfoqQ5987NIZFJPaACUN9D0w-8MA) or [champ](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx4e1dvQ0ld929K0k4OU_QOPi71ySPdY6Q) rewards and having this as your goal anthem. They could create their own jingle for each rank and I\u2019m sure the community will overwhelmingly applaud having something other than another decal or wheel as a season reward, even though some of the player base have player anthems disabled.\n\nThis was just a thought. The idea of this post is to say how prioritising player rewards over paid items may be viable, as the thought of getting a mystery innovative season reward may get more people hooked to the game in the long term. The player anthems season reward is a simple example of how this could be done.\n\nWhat other season rewards would you like to see? Let me know below!"

The other thing that kept me believing him is that his last relationship was 3 years (it\u2019s been a year since they broke up) so obviously he knows how to be in a serious committed relationship, I saw that as indicating he probably doesn\u2019t have attachment issues or fear of commitment so I definitely believed him when he was talking about a potential relationship with me. Also about the family thing, I went to two of his basketball games and they saw me at both of them and started asking him about me. He didn\u2019t say he wanted me to meet his family but rather that I should be aware that his family knows about me and might approach me the next time I\u2019m at one of his games because they\u2019re nosy like that. I think that makes it way less of a red flag but idk I probably shouldn\u2019t be defending him at all. My problem is idk if I\u2019m just the one making all the drama because I became so attached so fast or if he\u2019s just out here gaslighting me. I\u2019m definitely keeping distance right now, if he never talks to me again then I never will either but I just know he\u2019s gonna reach out to me either today or tomorrow and I\u2019m scared of getting sucked back in but also scared of letting go for good.

It was like I just instantly became obsessed with him from day 1 and I never felt like that for anyone before, not even my exes. Things could not have been more perfect in the first week like we really really couldn\u2019t get enough of each other, it\u2019s crazy how every single time we\u2019ve hung out we ended up staying up either all night or to ungodly hours just talking. Nothing is ever wrong when we are face to face or when we are speaking on the phone, every single problem we have has stemmed from miscommunication through text. The way I see it we shouldn\u2019t be having any issues, we should still be texting and calling like we were before, we should be planning dates at least once a week, things should be progressing towards a relationship. After having not spoken to him for two days I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gaining clarity about how crazy obsessive I was acting or if I\u2019m just gaslighting myself now because I\u2019m anxious about that fact that I don\u2019t have the power anymore. I feel like I was being excessive, like I can see how from his perspective maybe he really was super busy with school and basketball and was hitting me up when he could, maybe he avoided making plans this weekend because he knew his friend was visiting and he wasn\u2019t going to have the time for that, maybe he really was nervous about me like he said and wasn\u2019t sure if I was that into him because I\u2019m not as verbal about it as he is and I match his energy so whenever he\u2019s ignoring me I ignore him back. But at the same time, if you\u2019re into a girl why aren\u2019t you making the time to talk to her? Why are you cancelling plans on her or not planning anything at all? Why are you cool with not seeing and talking to her? He did say he wasn\u2019t expecting to like me so much and wasn\u2019t looking for this right now in his life so maybe he was pulling away because he was scared to be so attached or maybe I\u2019m just making excuses for him because that\u2019s what I want to believe.

I did a really good job not reaching out to him or responding to him trying to reach out to me but one day I got blackout drunk and I called him. I don\u2019t have any memory of the call but a few days later he had me blocked on social media and I was honestly devastated. But that devastation really helped me get out of the super obsessive phase and after that all it took was time. Him blocking me really made me fully accept that it was over and he didn\u2019t want me anymore, I think I was holding onto the delusion that he was still thinking of me and still wanted me back but that broke the delusion in half and made me face the truth. Basically moral of the story is it really sucks what you\u2019re going through but it does end, and maybe you need that catalyst event to happen to help you truly accept that it\u2019s over for good.",

It\u2019s crazy though what I learned about myself, when I was in that relationship I had the urge to cheat kind of often. I only did cheat the one time but I would think about doing it from time to time throughout the entire relationship. And then after we broke up it took months for me to not feel ill at the thought of another man touching me, I had absolutely no desire whatsoever to sleep with anyone including the guy that I had cheated with. Classic FA move, when I was in the relationship I was afraid of the intimacy so I sabotaged it, and when the relationship ended I suddenly was more invested in it then I ever had been before. Definitely not something I want to repeat in the future.",

                "body": "TLDR: I\u2019ve been seeing a guy for the last 3 weeks who I have a crazy connection with, never felt so connected with someone in my entire life. Things got very serious very fast, he told me he had feelings for me and we talked multiple times about the potential of being in a relationship. The first week was perfect but the last two weeks have been riddled with issues. It\u2019s become a pattern where everything is great in person but then he\u2019s wishy washy over text, cancels plans, and just overall isn\u2019t prioritizing me, and then I get mad and blow up on him for it and he begs me for forgiveness and tells me how much he likes me and gives an excuse for his behavior. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being overbearing and expecting too much from someone who I just met or if he\u2019s just playing around with me and being toxic. Any thoughts or advice? For the extended version, keep reading.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been seeing a guy for the past 3 weeks (for context we\u2019re 21 and in college). Met on tinder and immediately hit it off, spent days texting and FaceTiming and then planned a first date which went super well. He was super gentlemanly, everything clicked, it felt so natural like we had already known each other for years. We spent almost 24 hours with each other, stayed up the entire night talking and we both confessed that we really liked each other and could see this becoming something serious in the future. Everything continued the same til our second date and that went just as well, great date, stayed up all night talking, I really believed I met my next boyfriend. Then the problems started. After our second date we planned our third and fourth dates on Friday and Monday respectively. Friday rolls around and he didn\u2019t text me the whole day. I finally text him and ask if we\u2019re still on and he tells me he had a family emergency and is at home but that he wants to reschedule for Saturday. I say no problem. Saturday comes and he doesn\u2019t text me again and finally does at 6pm right before I\u2019m supposed to leave to meet him. He was being weird and dancing round it and finally told me not to meet him because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to make me drive that far\u201d, obviously bs. So I called him and asked what\u2019s going on and he told me he had a really bad loss (he plays basketball) and was in a bad mood and just didn\u2019t feel like socializing or going out that night. I kind of went off on him and told him I didn\u2019t think that wasn\u2019t an acceptable reason for cancelling on me and then didn\u2019t talk to him for the rest of the night. My guys friend told me I overreacted and that he was valid so the next day when he called and apologized and begged me to let him see me on Monday I agreed. So Monday happens, date went exactly the same as all the rest and I think we\u2019re all good again. He tells me he really really likes me, he says his family has been asking about me and want to meet me next time I come to one of his games, he\u2019s just as gentlemanly and attentive as he was before. But then the whole rest of the week he was being weird over the phone. He was taking long intervals between texts, he told me on two separate occasions that he wanted to FaceTime me but was working on homework, each time I told him just to call me when he was done and he never called. One day he told me he missed me and I said \u201cso make plans with me\u201d and he completely ignored that and changed the topic. The weekend rolled around and I had assumed we would make plans for one of the days but he never did, I point blank told him to make plans with me and again he brushed it off so I got mad and went off on him again. He called me 6 different times on Saturday to smooth things over, he said he was sorry for being MIA he just had a really tough week, he told me he really liked me and wanted to see me but yet again didn\u2019t even attempt to make plans with me. He told me he couldn\u2019t hang out that day because he had an out of town friend visiting. He called me again around midnight while he was at a party, was clearly drunk and told me he wished I was at the party with him, said how much he liked me and that he\u2019d call me again when he got home. He next called me at 3am and told me he wished he\u2019d cancelled on his friend so that I could be there, he even showed me his friend sleeping in his room so I know he wasn\u2019t lying about that, he told me how much he liked me again and kept saying that I looked really beautiful and then he said he was going to take me on a date on Sunday and that he\u2019d call me in the morning and let me know what the plan was. Sunday comes around and he doesn\u2019t call or text. I finally give in and send him a Snapchat bc he\u2019s usually quick responding on snap. He leaves me on delivered so I check his snap score. 2 hours later I\u2019m still on delivered and his snap score increased so I know he was on his phone. I send him a text. He leaves me on delivered for 3 hours and the whole time his snap score keeps increasing so I take that as my sign and just delete him off of snapchat and instagram and decide I\u2019m done. He finally texts me back after 4 hours and says he\u2019s sorry for not getting back to me he was just really hungover and had been in and out of sleep all day, not really on his phone. He then texts me again and asks if I blocked him on Snapchat. I respond telling him I did and I was sick of him not respecting me or prioritizing me and that I was over and done with it. He spent the next 24 hours blowing up my phone, either calling or texting me every few hours and finally I caved and asked him what he didn\u2019t understand about me saying I was over it. We had a back and forth where I laid out all my grievances and he told me he really really liked me and wanted another chance to prove it and that he was going to put more effort into me and he begged me to answer his calls so he could explain himself so I did. He said all the right things, told me he really wanted me and he was sorry for the past week and that he was going to do better so I told him I\u2019d think about giving him another chance. I texted him the next day and said that I believed him and I was going to give him another chance and he didn\u2019t respond to me for almost 24 hours. Then he finally texted me \u201csorry had to really think about what I wanted\u201d and so I responded saying he can tell me what\u2019s on his mind and now he has left me on delivered for almost 24 hours now. What the fuck was the point of blowing up my phone and begging me for another chance only to turn around and do this as soon as he got it? One thing he said on the phone was that he thought I was taking things too seriously, treating it like we\u2019d been in a relationship for 3 years instead of only knowing each other for 3 weeks, but in my mind I feel like it\u2019s not at all invalid to expect someone who tells you they like you and are serious about you to actually text you back, make plans with you and keep their word to you. So was I being extra or is he super toxic?"

                "body": "TLDR; My ex and I broke up 3 months ago and now I\u2019ve met someone new who I\u2019m very interested in, is it okay to pursue it or am I just rebounding and coping in an unhealthy way?\n\nI need an outside perspective on this situation because I think I\u2019m too bias at the moment. 3 months ago my bf of 7 months broke up with me. He told me he had lost feelings for me and I was completely blindsided by it. I was pretty heart broken for the first month, the second month I felt that I was healing and moving forward, and the third month I have felt back to normal, no longer sad, no longer thinking of him for the most part, I\u2019ve still had my moments of reflecting back on him and grieving the relationship but I haven\u2019t felt that I was grieving HIM in a long time, just that I was grieving the circumstances of our breakup and how horrible it was for me. As a general rule of thumb, I believe a person needs at least 6 months to truly process a breakup and move past their ex, and I will also say that I do not believe I am completely past it yet. I think I\u2019m very close but I am not 100% there yet. I also think 6 months gives a person time to be comfortable in their singleness again before they start looking to enter another relationship. So for my dilemma, I downloaded tinder about a month ago because I was ready to start sleeping with new people and I wanted to find a fwb, I was in no way looking for anything serious. I am very picky with men and haven\u2019t found much success in the app or irl but I came across a guy 5 days ago and I was instantly obsessed with him, like absolutely drooling over him, I even texted my friend his entire profile and said \u201cI need this man to match with me holy shit\u201d and we did end up matching. We started messaging and it was obvious we had chemistry, we messaged that whole night, texted the entire next two days, stayed up on facetime for hours with each other, and yesterday we had our first date. It went amazingly and we both confessed we had genuine feelings for one another. I have never in my life had such an instantaneous connection with someone like this, I have never felt so certain of wanting to be with someone before, none of my past relationships were like this, this just feels so different it\u2019s like we\u2019ve been together the whole time. I would really really love to enter a relationship with him, we literally have already been dancing around the subject as we both feel the same way, but I\u2019m not sure if this is entirely a genuine connection or if I\u2019m projecting some part of my need for connection onto him. I wanted to take my time to really heal and find true comfort and happiness being my myself again but now all I can think about is this new guy. Am I just throwing myself into a new person to get out of having to do all the work to fully heal or do you think I\u2019ve healed enough to where I can have a healthy relationship with him?"

It wasn\u2019t a bad interaction at all, we have a lot of mutual friends, one threw a party and we both got invited, we made some small talk and played a drinking game together and that was all, very civil. But I cannot stop myself from over analyzing every single thing that happened, I dreamed about him last night and honestly I dream about him randomly from time to time. I had another boyfriend whom I broke up with a couple months ago and he honestly looked identical to my first love, and I told myself that wasn\u2019t why I was attracted to him/dating him but it totally was. I can objectively recognize that I would never want to have a relationship with him ever again, that things ended for a reason and we\u2019d never last, but wow seeing him made me feel desperate for him all over again.

I just want to say that I am truly sorry the way I ended things. It was really fucked up and I really do feel bad. It was very selfish and na\u00efve. I hope you are doing well in school and enjoying yourself. You don\u2019t need to feel obligated to forgive me or even respond, this is something that I just feel that I need to do. I wish you the best of luck bc you deserve it! Have a blessed Christmas, keep being you.\u201d\n\nFor context, he broke up with me 2 months ago saying that he simply lost feelings for me. He did it over text and I was completely blindsided. My response to his breakup text was everything I could possibly say to him so there\u2019s nothing I need to get off my chest, he already understands how badly he hurt me bc I told him the first time around. We\u2019ve been 100% no contact since the breakup, he has absolutely no access to me and no way of knowing how I\u2019ve been doing since. I would never get back together with him nor do I think responding to him would elicit him asking for me back. The only function in responding is to help him through his healing, I want to tell him that when he\u2019s finally become the person he should have been for me then he\u2019s forgiven, I want him to do better and be better and I know he is capable of that, but I just don\u2019t know if he deserves any more of my energy or guidance.

He did it over text and completely blindsided me saying he had simply lost feelings for me. I immediately removed him off of all my socials and I texted him back after a couple days of processing and said everything I felt like I needed to say to him, he never responded to me and we have been no contact since that day. Well earlier today he sent me a text (PM if you want to read the whole text) essentially saying that he had been thinking about reaching out to me for weeks, that he wanted to say he was sorry for the way he ended things, and that he wishes me well. This is the text I have been waiting for since the breakup and it was honestly so gratifying to receive it. I can tell from the way he worded things that the guilt of leaving me in such an abrupt and childish way has been eating at him, that he most likely regrets it, hates himself, and it\u2019s clear he thinks very highly of me. That\u2019s everything I predicted would happen but actually knowing he is suffering from this and that he has put me in the box of \u201cthe one that got away\u201d in his mind is all the justice I could ever ask for. In his message he said \u201cyou don\u2019t need to feel obligated to forgive me or even respond\u201d and I\u2019m not sure if I should. I will first say that I do not want him back, I will never go back to him, and I don\u2019t believe responding to him will elicit him to ask for me back anyways. The only purpose of responding to him would be to provide that forgiveness he is hoping I\u2019ll give. I know he doesn\u2019t deserve it, he did me so dirty he should face those consequences by himself, he doesn\u2019t deserve my energy or wisdom, he  but I\u2019m also a very nurturing person. I always want people to do better, I like to help people become the best version of themselves, I can help him do better, be better, not for me but for the next girl. So should I respond to him, push him the right direction, help him heal? Or should I leave it alone and stop putting my energy into someone who doesn\u2019t deserve it?"

The first week was absolutely brutal, I was in denial at first and then I sobbed my heart out every day after, I couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d do something like that to me, I\u2019d trusted him fully. I felt like there\u2019s no way I could ever trust someone like that again, I felt like I\u2019d lost something great and it was going to be impossible to find someone like him again, I absolutely dreaded the idea of starting over with someone else, I couldn\u2019t fathom letting someone other than him touch me, I couldn\u2019t fathom him being with anyone else. I didn\u2019t eat for the first few days, my sleep schedule was a mess, and I constantly felt nauseous. I dreamed about him every night and whenever my phone buzzed I prayed it was him. Time moved so slowly for the first two weeks, I kept telling myself that time heals but when every day feels like 100 years it\u2019s hard to hold on to the idea that in a few months things will be better. But slowly it did get better, not that I felt good but that I stopped crying every morning, time started to speed up, my appetite came back, and the emotional waves started to get smaller and smaller. And then this week something changed. That hopeless feeling I\u2019ve had since the breakup isn\u2019t there anymore, I no longer feel like I need him in my life, he\u2019s gone and I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not completely over it yet of course but all the negativity that\u2019s been bouncing around my head for the past 6 weeks seems like it\u2019s dissipated and I can finally enjoy the life I have and look forward to the future again. So for everyone struggling right now thinking you can\u2019t even breath with out them, it gets better just hold on."

I couldn\u2019t be in the same room with him for more than 5 minutes, he gave me my space. He said he was going to take me to a nice steakhouse for dinner so I got dressed and we left. We were walking the street and he put his hands through my hair the way he used to and I tensed up so bad, wanted to yell at him to not fucking touch me but I didn\u2019t. We made it to the restaurant and then I woke up. Maybe I didn\u2019t outright say no to him but everything he did made me recoil.

If you have multiple dogs, doing the best dog first (my ridgie was my best a year ago when we had two older dogs) and letting the others watch him get praised and fed cheese while he calmly sits there.. helps set up a difficult dog for success. And then with my difficult dogs, I would just walk away and put the cheese away if they were bad.. pulling, growling, biting, etc. okay, we will try again later.. and once again let them see the good dog sit through it and behave, and what happens when he behaves. It only took me walking away once or twice for them to sit through it. We would have two people too, one dangling cheese in front of nose, commanding stay.. other person clipping toes. And again, only doing one or two paws in a session if they couldn\u2019t handle it.",

                "body": "My male was an angel puppy until about 6 months old. Good listener, easy to train, didn\u2019t chew a darn thing.. left him in the car with food we just ordered, wouldn\u2019t touch it. From 6 to about 18 months-about 2 years.. he started chewing excessively (not furniture but things, sometimes relatively important things- new shoes, my prescription glasses, door handles, and the worst of which was locking himself in my son\u2019s nursery & chewing his crib, destroying all the stuffed animals, scratching the door and chewing off all the molding around the door.. etc.). He is 3 now and over it. I think it was a mix of a lot of things, both developmental and environmental. We went through a couple moves, new baby, tried to keep him with us/bring him to work when he was a baby but as he grew bigger it became less feasible and had to leave him home (separation anxiety), excessive energy & developmental changes, etc. \n\nI started disciplining him by putting him in the corner, making him stay, and withholding attention/affection after he did something wrong (usually with a heavy scolding). I would not let him out from the corner until I was ready, and if he tried I would make him stay a little longer until it was my idea to call him out. This was usually a 5-10 minute thing, not an hours long ordeal. Now when I get home, I know if he was bad while we were gone because he will put himself in the corner. They are people pleasers so i think this punishment is really effective for them. \n\nNow at 3 years old he is an extremely well behaved and loving dog. He occasionally counter surfs, dumpster dives, or vomits random stuff up.. but thats all within the realm of normal dog territory and to be expected.. so I don\u2019t even punish him for the every now and then indiscretion now, especially if he is already doing the walk of shame. I can\u2019t recall the last time i put him in the corner, but he still will put himself there if he did wrong, like i said. Its usually a good indicator he got into the trash or ate a dirty diaper. He also puts on a very hilarious face as he walks into the corner, and kind of puts his ears half back, sort of elvish.. and smiles awkwardly at me. Hahaha. However, My shoes, furniture, glasses, moldings, doors, etc. are safe. He is mostly lazy and sleeps in our bed all day until we get home and then we let him run around outside or play inside for a bit & hes good.\n\nI would definitely have a consistent discipline routine that\u2019s effective. Doesn\u2019t have to be my idea. But if they know what to expect when they do wrong, they will do less wrong. They are people pleasing dogs, so lots of praise for good behavior as well. And exercise and attention go a long way in influencing behavior.",

The onus is not on me for the democrats to pick a candidate that is good enough to convince me to vote for him. Nor is it on me for his campaign to consist of sustenance that is something other than \"Not Trump 2020\" \n\nNot to mention, the arguments are not logically sound. \n\n*Why is any vote a wasted vote?* A vote for the candidate that speaks best to your ideology or principles is not wasted. That very vote is upholding confidence and integrity in the very idea of democracy, which obviously has been lacking in recent election cycles.\n\n*How is a vote for one candidate, really a vote for another (eViL) candidate?* This argument really only applies in swing states, which I am not in.. and only holds water when third party candidates or voting get enough percentage of the vote to change the narrative.. which is not necessarily a bad thing in my mind. Why is it bad to let the parties know our dissatisfaction with them? It also shows no real knowledge of the electoral college, especially when it's spoken in general to someone random on the internet who knows squat about where you live, what color your state usually goes, etc. Why even say it? I feel like it's the most lazy and unintelligent way to try to change someone's mind.. just attack their moral compass and hope they are dumb enough to fall for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your favorite arguments to combat this logic?

I would love to get in the 140-160 range. \n\nAny way, I would love to hear your Breastfeeding & Keto stories.. good or bad.

And was only playing so he could reach his dream of 1 million subs. So he outright said he is only playing normals bc he can't enjoy grinding ranked. But he still did the climbing challenge and he quit because if a pro player on camera can int him and not receive any punishment that's pretty fucked and it killed his motivation(which is understandable imo especially if you are having issues with enjoying the game)  \n\nThe claiming to be rank one and challenger is the least offensive and easiest to explain imo. If you go back years to him talking and giving advice on reddit or even him today. People always ask and shit on him for that. He's always responding honestly that since YouTube is his job. \nHe needs to make money. Click bait is the way he can do that. Especially now that he's losing money by paying very good editors for his videos. This is why I think he's a good guy. Because he honestly tells us why he's click baiting. Why he's playing in normals. \nWhy he doesn't like league. I don't think he's as good as Tfblade climbing wise but I have seen him solo kill tf blade in lane. As well as vetheo or bobqin ot Tyler1. You cannot honestly tell me he is a bad player or a sore loser if he's willing to admit when he's playing bad or when other people are better than him. I can honestly never understand this whole bad player claim when whether or not he was in gm or normals he was winning as easily. \n\nI can't speak to his ign name changing because I don't know which it is. Whether he wants to stop inters or keep is from finding his account. I do know that on his challenger climbs he stays on the same account however. \n\nEverytime he's streamed he's been very personal and nice to everyone. And anyone who asked what rank he was playing in got honest answers. Prof akali hasn't actually smurfed just for content in a long time. He's done customs with viewers or he's done normals. \n\nI'm not asking that you suddenly like him or anything. But that you can see my side due to these points.",

He made it to gm and quit the challenge like I said bc a pro inted him bc he didn't give blue and the pro faced no penalty. Prof akali made a whole tweet and twitlonger. \n\nI don't disagree he's absolutely smurfed a shit ton amd click baited too. But I dont necessarily believe he has been shady. Since the only examples I've seen are his contracts but he made a video explaining that and why it wasn't what LS and others had made it seem. \nI won't say he's the best akali onetrick but to say he's just an akali lover seems pretty condescending considering he's been playing that champ for like 9 years. It's just objectively true he plays her extremely well. Maybe not as good as beifeng or extremely accomplished onetricks on akali but he plays her good enough to lane with anyone on NA or pull clips in any elo. \n\nDon't take this as me blindly supporting him.

It showed 200 megabytes free with only Firefox open. \n\nFor the 21 gigs of virtual memory only 9 were available. I haven't messed with any systems of the pc that could affect this before or after I realized there was an issue. \n\nI'm having a lot of issues finding any sort of solution. \n\nI also can't enter bios for my pc. Any kind of cmd command or button press on my pc during startup doesn't activate it. \n\nThanks for any help!"

(tell)*\n\nA big part of giving out grammar exercises is to let students become familiar with language as it is used in situations they are familiar with. The question quoted seems a bit too arbitrary *(See arbitrariness in \"so\" and \"them\")*, and the students can't really learn much about the context in which this sentence can be uttered.\n\n**Then, there's the issue with grammar. It's not a good grammar exercise if it's riddled with errors.**  \ne.g. *If I \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ a gun I would have killed him to make him keep quiet.

It took quite a few months of practice but I have regained my B1, and have even extended to an A1 in full chest voice. Singing feels only slightly different than before, and it feels like I'm drawing air from a higher-up part of my chest than before. Interestingly, this improved my higher range.\n\nDue to the lack of exercise, I do run out of breath a lot more easily, but that's about the worst I could say about the effects of pleurodesis on singing.\n\nThank you for reading."

Before the surgery, I could sing B1 in chest on an average day, and A1 on a good day. Now I'm straining a little to even hit C2. It's a 2-notes difference, but for a bass, that boundary between the first and second octave is what distinguishes a good bass from an average bass. I'm also losing a bit of my high range as well (the falsetto just cuts out completely), but I haven't been brave enough to test my limits yet. \n\nSo basically, I lost the lower and upper parts of my vocal range after pleurodesis. It's only been 1 week, but I dread that it might be a permanent change.\n\nAre there any singers in this community who have encountered similar problems? Did it go away?"

However, it has never seemed very clear to me his actual dimension as it appears he's vibrantly sociable on camera, but painfully reserved in person. He doesn't seem shy, per se, but definitely reserved - almost certainly the type to rush home to play Minecraft rather than hang out with new friends. \n\nSo I've taken to the very trustworthy internet to gather some very reliable consensus on his orientation, and possibly reshape any potential misconception regarding his MBTI. (Note: introversion and extraversion on MBTI are distinguished only by their source of energy, and NOT shyness, confidence etc.). And since we're using Jung's theory, we're not accepting ambiversion.\n\n**Cast your holy vote for a completely meaningless investigation.**\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/k5v3od)"

I was thinking of stanning BTS because I saw their name everywhere. I decided to check out their new songs. When I watched the DNA MV, I decided not to stan. The MV and their dance choreography were above my expectations. Yet I found the song terrible. I still skip this song. It didn\u2019t grow on me. Later a friend of me told me to check out BTS. After watching their other MVs(especially BS&T) and listening to their albums. I loved the group. And stanned them. BTS is the first kpop group I stanned is my ult. I love their discography. But DNA is a flop for me. Honestly I\u2019m kinda disappointed their most viewed and streamed song is DNA. Dope or Fire deserves these title more. I don\u2019t know if this would be popular or unpopular.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/j4wqaf)"

Last week I invited her home and she seems happy and confident about her life.\n\nI know she broke with her boyfriend because he cheated on her, let her dream about a future together, then going to his other girl.

But her family send her to the hospital and I went to see her (it was my birthday and she called me the day before I visited her).\nLast month, she was sad about her (ex-)boyfriend and I tried to comfort her. She told me she won\u2019t tried to harm her, because she didn\u2019t want to go back to the hospital.\nI thought she felt better. She found an internship that seemed to interest her, she was going to move out with her sister (she lived with her boyfriend before the breaking-up but now she couldn\u2019t afford a place for her alone).\n\nNow I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing and I want to help her...

I can totally see how I am an Introverted feeler though, more than a thinker, I don't think I'm logical and objective enough. Thank you so much for your typing, and sorry for my doubts!",

                "body": "* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n25, F. I'm a lost soul pulling through, pretty optimistic and pushing on life, enjoying my family and my pets and coffee. Lately I've lost myself so I'm not sure of what I should write, I'm both entertaining, enthusiastic and enjoy lots of fun but also obsessive, a perfectionist, sensitive and unstable. I don't have much friends, only a couple online. I love music, TV Shows - big fan of The Umbrella Academy atm, movies in general, and my tastes have gone from horror to superheroes to true crime and classic literature. I have huge trouble to commit, I jump from one thing to the other real fast. I've been told that I'm both very fastidious and cynical but also kind and generous, I don't like people but I also love some of them dearly, mostly fictitious or famous. New experiences excite me a lot, new ice cream flavors, new tattoos, new food, but my depression has compromised all my desire to break free.\n\n* Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?\n\nMajor Depression and anxiety disorders.\n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI went to church when I was little because of traditions but it never had a meaning to me. I'm an atheist, and my family accepted it easily.\n\n* What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI don' work at the moment.\n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI would feel search for something to kill the time with since I imagine I'd get bored very easily. I like having fun with my family so I would miss it after a while, but I like being free from commitments with other people so that's positive.\n\n* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?\n\nI like going outside to walk my dog, taking as an opportunity to jog. I like events like concerts, plays, anything that makes me curious but I get annoyed easily. I don't do any sport right now because of Covid but I plan to go to the gym someday, plus the idea of doing some sport has always seemed fun and cool. However, I've never got into sports that much and I'm a big goof. I always preferred more hobbies like reading or painting but it's something I more so impose myself to do, becoming knowledgeable and an intellectual has been an ideal I always looked up to but I don't have the focus or patience to accomplish it sadly. It's a great disappointment...I am drawn more to playing a videogame like Mario or Pok\u00e9mon and watch Youtube, just something more funny and chill.\n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI've been lost in my ideas and potential opportunities a lot to the point of not being as successful as I would like to be. I always have a new plan to get into working and do stuff, new hobbies and new looks, but I've jumped so much from one to another to lose myself completely. I don't know who I am anymore.\n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nIf I didn't suffer so much from anxiety and wasn't so insecure, leading a group on a project or being the creative mind behind would be cool! I'm the kind of person who wants to do everything perfect, and don't accept others' opinions easily, I search for insights only if I'm totally in chaos and I can't help myself. I believe I work better alone, if I was to lead a group I could probably become impatient with my colleagues...But again, through all my life I've become very fragile because of many events so maybe I'd fail.\n\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nFrom 1 to 10, I'd say 6 1/2. I like the act of drawing and all the mediums, I want to become good at all the hobbies I tried, knitting gave me the most pleasurable and relaxing experience of my life. I'm not too clumsy but I can miss a lot of physical stuff around me.\n\n* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI'm not a huge huge talented creative person but the idea of becoming good at painting and drawing has always gave me the motivation of at least trying, but I'll admit, I never keep at it so long to actually improve. I give up too early. I like creating stories in my head and I've envisioned myself becoming an artist in many mediums. I like art but it hasn't been a constant in my life, again, I'm too quick to jump from one thing to the other, it's very messy. I like dark, grotesque and freaky art, but I'm a big fan of Impressionism.\n\n* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI've planned for my future for years but never established a definite plan. I'm more excited about my future which is the reason I'm so optimistic 'cause I believe there is always something good around the corner for everyone. The present is made to be lived and should be used in the best way possible, the past is full of sadness and bad memory, better forget about it.\n\n* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI always give up on helping, I'm awful at saying no. Lately I've discovered that I mostly help people because I want approval and admiration from them, or to get closer and bond with someone I like. I'm not sure it comes extremely natural but I try myself.\n\n* Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes but it's not the most important thing. We should also have an inspiration and purpose to follow in life. I want to be constant on what I'm working on in life. I'm an impulsive person and scatterbrained as well though.\n\n* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nHuge importance, work hard to get what you want in your life. Make the most of it, life is too precious, and gosh I wish I was following my own advice. Under stress I become a sloth, but in my best state of mind I love being productive. Depression is a bitch.\n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nNo, but I'm very very critical of others. I let them be but inside me there is something that wants to explode and tell people how things are and how irrational, self important they look. But I don't act on it, I have no reason to control others and no benefits. I'm a control freak with everything inside my head, with myself, that's for sure.\n\n* What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nListening to music, even though I go from genre to another from one day to the other fast (classical, metal, folk, IDM) music can be so pleasant, beautiful melodies, rythms, moods and variety. I like fun and light videogames, short ones with a good setting and interesting mechanism, I'm drawn to competitive ones, I always want to be the best and perform well and if I don't I get upset. I like to watch movies and TV Series but I don't have a very good focus so I don't finish a lot of stuff, but when I do I feel a Goddess! I've done a lot of reading in my life but the most I can do right now is short stories, 100 pages more or less. I watch Youtube but it's more of a coping mechanism when I fall into my awful sloth mode.\n\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nAt school I was good with writing, or at least when going off the rails was okay because I was never able to stick to the prompt a lot. My memory is very good, and was what gave me the best and easiest high grades. When I was younger I was the good at drawing kid in class.\n\n* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI definitely like plans and lists to follow through, and I perform well when I'm on a fixed routine. I jump right in with some stuff though so I don't even know what I'm doing, if it doesn't work I just throw it off. I'm not good at following through because I get exhausted and impatient like nothing.\n\n* What's important to you and why?\n\nLiving life in the fullest way possible, accomplishing what I dream and want, pull through everything bad in life, not giving up, being liked by those I want to be liked from. Being free from external influences, productive, focused, recognized as the best - BE the best.\n\n* What are your aspirations?\n\nAccomplishing one big thing which will make me go, \"YOU DID WELL\". Finding my soulmate, travel, being free from external obbligations, dictating my own future, thrive in life.\n\n* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI'm scared of wasting my life. I get uncomfortable and cringe hard with people who act stupid or make bad judgments, who are total assholes to everyone who has it worst, who are self-important and believe they are untouchable and self-righteous. I'm not a big fan of new slangs or trends, or just silly unreasonable delusional people who don't have anything to do. Do mind, if I find something funny and cool I'm all about it but I'm very detached from social medias or the new online cultures. What I hate most is selfish egoistic \"I'm always right and the important one \" people and yes, I hope I'm not too much of an hypocrite. Those who don't care what impact on other people and their surrounding they have, who think only about themselves and that they're in a good place and others can just go fuck themselves and suffer, are the worst.\n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nI become excited, enthusiast, I love to crack jokes, be sort of a clown to entertain who I love, have lots of fun. I'm optimistic for my future and excited about everything, even the little things.\n\n* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nI become slothful, without inspirations, tired, but also obsessive and paranoid about what should I do daily or for my future.\n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI snap easily from my imagination and thinking, I'm not focused even in my own brain. Still, sometimes I just switch off and start creating scenarios in my head. I'd say I merge into my surroundings, in the music I'm listening, everything I'm touching, I know it's there but at the same I forget about it.\n\n* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI get bored and impatient. I would probably become apathetic.\n\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nA short time but I've changed it so, so much I don't know who I am anymore. I can be indecisive and impulsive, and both have caused me a lot of problems.\n\n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI process my emotions fast, in one minute I will forget what I was sad about and make myself switch mood like nothing happened. I think emotions can be important if they are behind our greatest objectives in life, if they push us to believe in our purpose that's incredible. If rage makes you a great wrestler, if sadness makes you a good songwriter, then emotions are valuable and precious.\n\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nYes, I don't want to cause trouble and I don't want to hurt anyone, also I'm a huge people pleaser. I will keep a conversation going even if I don't want 'cause I feel obligated to the other person, and I don't want to disappoint.\n\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\nIf the law works, we should follow it. Good rules are to be respected. When they are defective they must be improved.\n\n* What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\nBeing accomplished and happy, free to travel but living in my own corner in the world."

Why?\n\nI'm scared of wasting my life. I get uncomfortable and cringe hard with people who act stupid or make bad judgments, who are total assholes to everyone who has it worst, who are self-important and believe they are untouchable and self-righteous. I'm not a big fan of new slangs or trends, or just silly unreasonable delusional people who don't have anything to do. Do mind, if I find something funny and cool I'm all about it but I'm very detached from social medias or the new online cultures. What I hate most is selfish egoistic \"I'm always right and the important one \" people and yes, I hope I'm not too much of an hypocrite. Those who don't care what impact on other people and their surrounding they have, who think only about themselves and that they're in a good place and others can just go fuck themselves and suffer, are the worst.\n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nI become excited, enthusiast, I love to crack jokes, be sort of a clown to entertain who I love, have lots of fun. I'm optimistic for my future and excited about everything, even the little things.\n\n* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nI become slothful, without inspirations, tired, but also obsessive and paranoid about what should I do daily or for my future.\n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI snap easily from my imagination and thinking, I'm not focused even in my own brain. Still, sometimes I just switch off and start creating scenarios in my head. I'd say I merge into my surroundings, in the music I'm listening, everything I'm touching, I know it's there but at the same I forget about it.\n\n* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI get bored and impatient. I would probably become apathetic.\n\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nA short time but I've changed it so, so much I don't know who I am anymore. I can be indecisive and impulsive, and both have caused me a lot of problems.\n\n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI process my emotions fast, in one minute I will forget what I was sad about and make myself switch mood like nothing happened. I think emotions can be important if they are behind our greatest objectives in life, if they push us to believe in our purpose that's incredible. If rage makes you a great wrestler, if sadness makes you a good songwriter, then emotions are valuable and precious.\n\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nYes, I don't want to cause trouble and I don't want to hurt anyone, also I'm a huge people pleaser. I will keep a conversation going even if I don't want 'cause I feel obligated to the other person, and I don't want to disappoint.\n\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\nIf the law works, we should follow it. Good rules are to be respected. When they are defective they must be improved.\n\n* What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\nBeing accomplished and happy, free to travel but living in my own corner in the world."

Help is much appreciated!\n\n*  I'm very future oriented, almost obsessed, always wondering what I could do with my life and everything I do must benefit my plans;\n* It's difficult for me to commit, but when I do I'm very stubborn and can accomplish what I want;\n* My biggest stress is being in an unhealthy place full of conflict, I always get thrown away and I'm used to go along with what people want from me even if it hurts me big time, and I can never stand up for myself - I try to be as nice as possible to people because I believe it's the right thing to do;\n* I am a huge perfectionist and have high standards for myself, to the point where I lost on many opportunities because I believed I wasn't good enough;\n* I like to be alone and get exhausted by too much social engaging to the point of stress, but sometimes I like to stay upbeat and have fun with a someone I have a liking for;\n* I can be pretty judgmental, it's something I get criticized for by my family, I can be very nitpicky and find all kind of faults in people;\n* I'm very obsessive about everything being right, I can't stand chaos in any aspect of my life;\n* Not into politics, although I have my opinions about how the world could run better, even though they are a bit offbeat;\n* Even though I do my best to treat everyone with care, I'm afraid I'm not natural at empathy and sympathy, which maybe could be a result of my isolation from people since I was a teenager - I'm not bad, just it doesn't come very easy;\n* I love art of any form, but I don't see myself as a good artist - again, maybe it's my perfectionism talking, but I sure am not a master in anything;\n* I am a very tight and anxious person, still I like to think sometimes I can get practical about the easiest stuff in life;\n* The thing I hate about myself most is how god awful sensitive I am, I can't get criticism and I tend to get a lot of what people tell me bad, to the point of falling into a limbo of anxiety and panic;\n* My goals are simply to accomplish my dreams and plans and find a place in the world where I can be happy and fulfilled."

I feel invalidated when femboys are used as items for \u201cthe bad boy\u201d I feel like my identity is a joke to them. I don\u2019t think many femboys are actually on reddit or even anywhere for that matter, but feel free to share how this topic makes you feel, whether you\u2019re a femboy or not.\n\nEdit: thank you for the support and attention on this post. I\u2019m glad we all agree that this is an issue and I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not alone in this. I never really see discussions get anywhere so I\u2019m glad to see everyone upvoting and talking out. Thank you :D"

Things have been great! But there are a few things that I've noticed about her that I'm not sure if they are deal breakers.   \n1. There's times she's super affectionate, and times where she's to herself. I am affectionate most times, but I think I am getting a bit resentful because she has pushed me away sometimes.  \n2. At times, when I would initiate sex, she would randomly get up and start to clean her room or wash the dishes. And then get ready to go to sleep. Not sure if it was her way to call me to bed, but very it would be confusing.  \n3. Earlier yesterday I told her about how I felt and if we could work on it together, and she told me she'd look into it. It makes me wonder if in the future when things come up, she'll want to handle it her way without my opinion.  \nHave any of you gone through this? I've also expressed to her to be open and honest with me, but it seems she holds things to herself. I want to make this work, but I don't know if I can build a life with someone who is dare I say, selfish."

Its read in this clip.([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_nprPycZow)) Although the full poem is not read in Interstellar I recognized it immediately. In the movie the Earth is old and dying there is sandstorms and droughts so bad that people are burning thier crops because it's not worth it anymore. Earth has gotten so bad that all talk of Nasa and space exploration have been wiped out of history textbooks. The movie takes the main character to explore thier last hope in space. The significance of this poem in Interstellar is that Earth has lost its hope but they need to fight to find the hope. In the movie the poem is read as they're leaving Earth.\n\nThe movie itself somewhat of a parallel of the poem, Because the poem is about how people should live life to the fullest and not give up in thier last moments. The speaker talking to thier dad wants him to fight the reaper just like how the main character and the crew are Earth's last hope fighting the inevitability of the end.",

When I was younger my parents told me I was adopted and told me to keep it a secret. The older I got I wondered why, when I told my friends I was made fun of and it's often an insult to say someone is adopted.\n\nMy other thoughts on *The Importance of Being Ernest,* I think it's a good play I enjoyed reading it and watching the one on [***Youtube***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWPftxsBPz0) by the Bethany Lutheran College. I like the parallel of Jack vs Ernest and the excuse that Algernon uses of having Bunbury to get out of socializing. I also find it funny that Jack's fake persona as Ernest is his real name in the end.",

That sounds dumb but out of the 3 months we were dating we only really hung out 3 times, then my grandpa died I kinda went on a hiatus from her because I was already so stressed from her. Then she sends me a text about getting married while I\u2019m at the funeral, she couldn\u2019t have known but I didn\u2019t answer, I finally get back to my house and I talk with her a little bit and she basically goes off on me for not texting her when she will do the same. She never texts me, never calls me, I have to start everything and when she actually does plan something she flaked on me. So I\u2019ve been giving it everything I\u2019ve got and I just couldn\u2019t anymore, so we broke up. Finally today my uncle died and to top it off she went on a date with someone new."

Why would you make people be responsible of a future human being if they don't feel/aren't ready to? When someone wants to adopt a child they have to meet some requirements to do it, why is it more important to force a life than to guarantee it will have some quality if we're talking about pregnancy? \n\nAs you said, the fetus would *eventually* be a functioning human being, but at the time it is indeed a fetus that feeds of and may harm the pregnant person it can't be taken care of by anyone else, why shouldn't this pregnant person have the opportunity to make a decision relating to their body?

My personal opinion is that what you describe isn\u2019t hard to prove - stock purchases of publicly traded companies and mutual funds and ETFs are records that can be obtained and you aren\u2019t stabbing in the dark - you know these transactions occurred. If you know the bank the funds were held at then that would be simple to have the records ordered to be produced by the court. That is, if you are correct about your rights to the funds in California. I\u2019m in Connecticut where pre-marital assets are also considered on the table and must be disclosed. However, there is no guaranteed entitlement to them since we aren\u2019t a community property state.\n\n\nProbably the most important piece you need to ask is understanding if there is any entitlement to having your ex pay your legal fees to go after your share of those assets under these circumstances. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

It\u2019s very confusing and distorted, and absolute gibberish that my brain can\u2019t process. \n\nAlso other things that happen because of the sensory disorder are not hearing what people say the first time, asking them to repeat it, and half way through the explanation my brain processes what they said the first time and I can then reply.\n\nYes, most people mishear lyrics in songs, but this is the entire song in complete gibberish that I cannot understand.

I've been so shy and insecure for my whole adolescence up to the recently, to a point where I didn't allow myself to try things in fear of rejection, also because I kinda feel a bit scared of men. Also my age in general is something that makes me a bit anxious. I'm still young I know, but I feel that I didn't experience anything yet. And it makes me a bit sad.\n\nI try to appear calm and collected about it, but I feel incredibly awkward all the time. I consider myself somewhat attractive, I still feel a bit insecure about my body and weight, but I can work with it. However i can't help but feel awkward and alien when talking with men lol. I don't get the whole flirting stuff, I don't get sarcastic humor, I don't react on flirty comments because I don't know how to react to them. My intrusive thoughts come and go when I'm talking with the other, and I can momentarily forget the anxiety and simply talk about our interests, but when it comes back.. it makes me feel like a total alien to the whole situation, again.\n\nAnd I didn't plan on sharing this because well.. shyness. But since I always see guys talking about being single and having a difficult time in getting dates, or women taking about having bad experiences with dating men, I feel like I share a bit of both realms of possibilities, but never entirely feeling identified with them. So I shared my own thoughts. \n\nCan some women relate to this? Do guys find annoying or boring a woman with no experience? And if so, how can I appear more interesting?"

                "body": "High consumption and spending means people have extra money to spend. They have money to spend because their jobs/businesses are doing well. Their jobs/businesses are doing well because it's easy for businesses to borrow money, which allows them to invest and grow, leading to more jobs and money for the workers to spend and help other businesses thrive. Likewise, it's a sign that people can afford to swipe their credit card to buy goods and services and buy homes with mortgages (giant loans). That all means that ths interest rate is low and the cost to borrow money is cheap.\n\nA strong economy means people have jobs and have enough money to spend. That means people have disposable money they have stashed that they can use to buy extra goods and services. More importantly, businesses are still thriving from the injection of money they printed over the years which is keeping everyone's jobs afloat and other businesses afloat. It's all a cycle that feeds itself: a growing economy will keep growing and a shrinking economy will keep shrinking.\n\nSo when there is a ton of money circulating in the economy, that means people have a lot of money to spend. Initially, there's a high supply of money in comparison to the demand for goods. In other words, because everyone has money to buy goods and services, the competition is fierce, and that high demand drives up the price. When the price inflates, each dollar's buying power decreases. So even though there may be more money circulating and people are spending a lot, eventually it gets to a point (gradually) where the market catches up with the injection of money and the overall supply of money.  The demand starts to match the supply and actually starts to weaken the ability for people/businesses to buy. So with the higher price of supplies, businesses cannot keep up and must cut costs by shrinking and laying off employees. They must also raise prices to stay afloat. A bit more time until employees struggle with layoffs while struggling to pay for the higher cost of goods that businesses set since they are also struggling.\n\nInjecting more money is a temporary solution that will lead to further inflation, and at some point, the inflation will start to run away if it's not contained. **In a strong job market and economy, the inflation will never subside because people can keep spending to keep up with inflated prices.** One reason why that's happening now is because of the lack of workers overall compared to the whole of human population (lack of population growth), thus there is relatively high demand for employees which forces companies to pay higher wages to win over the worker from the competition. Covid also brought on the Great Resignation and an awakening to many workers to demand more out from their jobs and employers. However, higher wages keep the economy running strong while inflation is ongoing in the background. Thus, the Fed must increase the interest rate to prevent people and businesses from borrowing, which ultimately leads to low spending. A weak economy is a sign that inflation is being reduced. A lot of money in savings accounts means people can't afford to spend carelessly spend because easily borrowing money is no longer an option, and the money they do borrow hits them with an expensive interest rate that eats up any disposable money they could have spent. That is what they're looking for to know that they are fighting inflation.",

The rich suck because they can afford to live a life of comfort and ease with relatively little sacrifice compared to the worker. It's not fair that some people get a pass for being born into wealth. Nobody is saying it is.\n\nBut everything comes down to supply and demand. Every transactional value between worker to business owner, owner and investor, supply chain and business, etc comes down to supply and demand. And any party at any point can choose to walk away from the table if they can obtain better value elsewhere; supply and demand sets the baseline but it's possible to get more than the market average with increased risk.\n\nUltimately, if the worker believes that they convert 100% of their contribution to 100% of value and profits to the business, then they are free to leave their employer to do so. The worker should simply get a better transactional contract to sell their valuable work to the market without the middleman. Perhaps they can realize the other side of the coin then.",

Only and only if you are in a red state I would say you should vote for Biden. Biden will sadly be the only possible option for a government without Trump. He has made some efforts to attract people further to the left with proposals like free college for low-income students, lower the Medicare age to 60, student debt relief for low/middle-income people- he doesn\u2019t go a step further to make it for-all but it\u2019s a step for Biden. The Green Party also advocates for these things but if your vote could actually make a difference in a red state vote for Biden to have at least some left ideas in the government.\n\nSince I\u2019m in a blue state I\u2019m going with the Green Party, I cannot vote for Biden, I only would if I were in a red state. Just what I would do and recommend in this situation as a lot of Bernie\u2019s supporters will also identify with this.",

I don\u2019t have many friends and I would say that she is the only true friend that I have so I am heavily dependent on her. I know that my expectations for her to have me also as her only friend is too much. She is more sociable than I am, so it is reasonable that she\u2019ll have more friends. Lately I have found myself getting mad whenever I see that she\u2019s hanging out with or just talking to other people. When I see that other people have texted her I get jealous. I also always check what she\u2019s doing on social media a lot and see if she\u2019s online and if she is, I check on the possible friends that she could be talking to who are not me. When I see that she is interacting a lot with other friends, I get extremely jealous of them, mad and sad. I have even cried over this, which is absolutely insane, stupid and ridiculous . I don\u2019t want to feel this way anymore because I know it\u2019s not beneficial for either of us and it\u2019s really something I\u2019ve been struggling with. I know that making more friends would be good advice but it just isn\u2019t for me. I have more people in my life but I don\u2019t consider them friends because I want really deep connections which I rarely find, and the only person I\u2019ve found is the friend I have talked about. I don\u2019t want to lose this amazing friendship over this and I want to fix this before it\u2019s too late. What can I do about this?\n\nThank you in advance to anyone."

                "body": "I\u2019m glad you asked this, because, imo, this kind of analytical \u201cwhat specifically is required in order to cause *x*\u201d thinking is a significant part of what we\u2019ve been lacking throughout this whole short-squeeze saga.  Descriptive analysis of how the HFs may be manipulating price or covering their positions is only meaningful to the extent that it enables us to actually determine a collective next move.\n\nTo directly answer your question, I think that initial buy pressure from us retail investors caused certain institutions which were *not* short GME to start taking aggressive long positions, and it became something of an institutional battle\u2014at least more so than before.  Of course, once RH restricted buying, the perceived fuel to the fire was lost, and I think that a lot of these long institutions sold around the top.  The narrative that retailers pushed to $350 completely on their own is pretty much BS in my opinion, because we simply don\u2019t have that much buying power.  \n\nHowever, in terms of what we can take away from this, the catalyst for another squeeze would likely be similar: buy pressure from retailers causes institutions to get in on the action, and, importantly, the resulting price movement brings GME into the spotlight once again, solidifying a legitimate squeeze.\n\nThe issue that we run into is that this solidification is something of a chicken/egg; in order for institutions to truly start buying back in, there needs to be price movement such that GME makes headlines again.  But in order for said price movement to occur, institutions need to be a part of the buy pressure\u2014as retailers alone do not have sufficient power.  \n\nThe only real potential catalyst for a second squeeze that I see isn\u2019t some tired HF manager deciding to throw in the towel after a long battle of pure attrition with us retail GME holders; that would be utterly inane on the part of HFs so long as they\u2019re able to just keep kicking the can farther down the road.  GME\u2019s return to the public consciousness can\u2019t be the result of market forces alone\u2014there needs to be some sort of market-adjacent externality that reminds people and institutions of the situation certain HFs have put themselves in and the massive potential there is for *capitalizing* on that situation.  By externality, I mean something like a tweet, an SEC report, a piece of related legislation, maybe even an emergency fuckin shareholders meeting.  \n\nWhat it comes down to is that we have to consider the path to a squeeze beyond mere \u201cbuy and hold\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd2a.\u201d  We need to determine what\u2019s feasible and act accordingly.  So, putting it out there, what possible paths do you guys see to putting GME back in the spotlight? What sort of extra-market occurrence do you think could set the spark again, and what might we be able to do to make it happen?",

Not just the Super Bowl winner will be going to Disney World this year, every one is going. All games are in Orlando - bubble style.\n\nTo start off, different Disney princesses will be flipping the coin. All refs will be wearing Mickey Mouse ears unless the Packers make the playoffs and they are at a Packers game then it will be a foam cheese wedge to make it obvious what's happening for newer fans.\n\nDisney mascots will be randomly assigned to sidelines as follows to teams by seeding using a random number generator:\n\nNFC #1 The 3 Caballeros, #2 The Rescuers, #3 Oliver and Company, #4 Dumbo, #5 Lilo and Stitch, #6 Bambi, #7 Sword in the Stone, #8 Home on the Range\n\nAFC #1 Hercules, # 2 Peter Pan, #3 Jungle Book, #4 The Emperor's New Groove, #5 Wreck-It-Ralph, #6 The Great Mouse Detective, #7 Zootopia, #8 Pocahontas \n\nList of the 62 full length Disney movies:\nhttps://m.filmaffinity.com/en/movie-group.php?group-id=207\n\nIf the Bills and Bengals play all player points will be assigned to the Week 17 fantasy football matches.\n\nNickelodeon will simultaneously cast all games. \n\nOvertime will be decided by a 53 versus 53 foam light saber battle.\n\nFeel free to add more bogus bologna last second rule changes in comments because why not."

Because of this, I essentially didn\u2019t even need to put any effort whatsoever into making friends. It literally just happened over time as we all got to know each other and get comfortable with each other since we had all the same classes together, ate lunch together, etc. I often just followed people around and silently listened to their conversations because that was socially acceptable there. I didn\u2019t need to join clubs or even meet people outside school. In fact, I almost never did that kind of stuff.\n\nAs you can imagine, it\u2019s not easy to transfer that kind of behavior to college. Simply existing and being approachable isn\u2019t going to make you friends since it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll meet the same people outside that one class/club you\u2019re both in. Especially if you\u2019re like me and have social anxiety and don\u2019t like leaving your room without a specific purpose in mind. Everyone\u2019s too busy doing their own thing to talk to you anyway unless you intentionally engage with them and I genuinely don\u2019t know how one even does that without having at least a month of history with a person. And don\u2019t even get me started on the feeling that everyone has established friend groups already (even if I know this is just my perception).\n\nIs there a still way for me to make friends by just casually existing in a group, or is my only solution to try to overcome this?"

                "body": "I have this weird, but pressing need to share my complete story here. Thanks to everyone who is willing to read it. It's the story of how my egg cracked and of where I'm now. Parts of it will be sexually explicit, so read at your own discretion. This story also includes the story of my sexual orientation because those two things developed with strong overlapping. \n\nLike most people assigned male at birth, I grew up without expecting anything to be different about me. Sure, I had some female friends and enjoyed some female coded ways of playing and I really didn't like some of the male coded ways of playing (like all team sports), but this didn't raise any flags. During early puberty, I sometimes masturbated at nighttime commercials, but I didn't have anyting in the way of porn because I didn't have internet. I had a crush on a girl, but she was pretty masculine in most ways. Years passed and I eventually got my own computer with an internet connection. Suddenly, porn was easily available. This way, I got into Yaoi \u2013 the stereotypical kind of Yaoi with bery effiminate Uke (the receiving partner). I identified as those Uke and was secretly sad that I could not be like them. Anyway, I joined a gay Yaoi/anime community and introduced myself as bisexual. However, it increasingly felt as if that term didn't really fit me. So I switched my identity as gay and came out. \nSchool ended and university began. There was a sort of gay representation at campus and I joined with my first day and never missed a meeting. This way, I was recruited as one of the people in charge. I went to the networking meeting and cwore drag for my first time. While I really liked the concept, I wasn't comfortable participationg myself because I was upset that I wasn't cute wearing womens clothes. Even though I knew that this wasn't the point, it still bugged me. \nEventually, the political climate of the queer community changed and the network meeting didn't just include gay, but also trans representation. Somehow, this made me feel more comfortable t the network meetings. I explained it with the place being more considerate of everyones feelings. Anyhow, we decided to join that bandwagon and bring trans topics to the agenda. Eventually, we even changed the name and the rules of our organization to be more inclusive. I was one of the people who managed that transition.\nThe next part of the story starts with me finding My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. I became a fan very quickly and joined some brony boards. I met some wonderful people there, especially since it wasn't the toxic part of the fandom. I had a crush on one of those people \u2013 and she was a pre HRT transwoman. The attraction wasn't purely or even primarily physical, so I had to deal with the fact that I had a crush on a woman. This shattered my sexual identity to the part where I was attracted to Cisgender women again. I'm still amazed how my desire to fit in some category eradicated this attraction, but back it was. I didn't bother coming out as pansexual, mostly because I'd have to explain people what it was.\nTalking about sexuality, I did give up on romance after a particularily bad crush, but at some point, I decided I'd slut around. I met some strangers on a gay dating platform and sucked their dicks. I wasn't even that attracted to the ones I met (the ones I have been attracted to weren't interested), but I enjoyed the idea of being a slut for cock. Eventually, I stopped that nonsense because one part of the idea didn't appeal to me \u2013 the hollowness of the whole experience. I didn't like being that interchangable and the men whose cock I sucked weren't even really attractive to me, I just liked to be in this position. I just wanted it to be with someone I actually cared about.\nI found that satisfaction again by buying feminine clothes, shaving off the pelt and sending nudes to people on the internet who would have been in a relationship with me if they lived on the same continent. For once in my life, I did feel sexy and I somehow needed an aspect of feminisation to it.\nMy egg even almost cracked, but I didn't think that I felt any dysphoria, it just was to subtle to catch up. I also figured that being a woman wouldn't \u201efix\u201c me because there are parts of my gender I did like.\nSomehow, I stumbled upon a post that linked to /traa. It was cute, I get along very well with trans people and the memes were somehow relatable. It took me a few days to notice that they were more relatable than I had thought. I ended up looking back and finding that many things made sense under the assumption that I wasn't cis. It made sense that I felt a certain satisfaction messing with people on Omegle, claiming I was a woman. It made sense that I was kinda glad that many people mistook my phone voice as female."

I track my periods every month, but this time it seems to be unreasonably late.

                "body": "I recently started reading this book which deals with the story of an unnamed narrator and her specifically the story of her obsession with a certain guy. It's a lot better than that description, and I'd recommend checking out the story, but one aspect of the main character is that she struggles with body image and food issues ever since she was young. One excerpt from the novel really stood out to me and puts into words one of the reasons why I personally have an ED which I'm unable to recover from.\n\n*\" I\u2019ve never understood how people can love their bodies, nor really understood how they can hate them either. I\u2019ve always seen my body as nothing so much as deeply disturbing in its constant variance, a fluctuating, unmanageable thing that has basically nothing to do with me, is not really any of my business at all.* \n\n*How am I supposed to accept or like or hate or be neutral about a thing that will not stay the same? How can I maintain consistent feelings towards a changing thing like that? Should I concede instead that I can\u2019t, that it\u2019s necessary instead to cleave my body \u2013 in all its hideous wilful growth and recession and blooming and withering \u2013 from myself, from me?* \n\n*I am told this is impossible. I am told this most often by men. They have studied philosophers I haven\u2019t, but the things they say in dressed-up terms are just like the florid self-help slogans by women they think are stupid. The things they say are: You are your body. There is no divide. When it changes, that\u2019s you changing. You are not just a witness to your body\u2019s vagaries, you are the architect. \"*\n\nI have always struggled with change and have always had a certain \"complex\" around growing up, puberty, womanhood, and just in general my body changing and how that would affect my life/how others would view it. I've always wanted to be \"safe\" and protect myself from the inevitable that would come with having no control over my own body. I know this is pretty common amongst ED sufferers, but I just wanted to put it out there regardless.\n\nI feel like women in particular are defined by their bodies first and foremost and are treated accordingly. People react differently to changes when it comes to women. To me, my ED behaviors have gotten so engrained into my psyche, that my body changing or me recovering isn't just a matter of weight gain, but a complete change in identity and who I am as a person. Part of the reason why I got my ED was so I could protect myself from the antiquated way others would choose to define me in a way that doesn't feel like myself, but instead I just lost my identity along the way."

I can eat a certain number of calories as restriction in the morning, and easily not eat anything else for the rest of the day with breakfast as my only meal, but for some reason just having to \"wait\" for food and for meals just seems impossible to me.\n\n I can't do the whole skipping breakfast and just \"waiting\" for my next meal (be it lunch or dinner) for when I can finally eat, because I get anxious and skittish and can't stop thinking about food for the entire time. It also is sort of triggering because I feel like waiting till I'm really hungry to eat makes me feel like a failure as well (because I would want to deny my body nutrients and prevent myself from seeing food as a \"reward\",even though im always excited to wake up and eat so im not sure the logic behind that reasoning).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdk, anyone else this way and prefer to eat during the A.M. instead?"

But every time, I seriously regret it afterwards. Sometimes I eat a normal amount whereas other time I find myself giving in to impulsively snacking or eating more than I should at meals, to sometimes I know I go well over my calorie limit/TDEE. It really doesn't help the fact that I end up not being able to focus and feeling sick as well often times due to not being used to having big proportions. It's one day, but I always fear that it will lead to sabotage my weight loss (especially if I end up having to high restrict during the weekdays if I can't get away with just skipping meals altogether). \n\nToday I decided I would allow myself a cheat day to eat more because I have a big test tomorrow and didn't want to take any chances with possibly feeling too tired or not being able to absorb the material I'm currently reviewing. However the day didn't go as planned and I ended up eating too many of my allowed calories in the morning, and wanted to force myself t restrict for the rest of the day, but I ended up feeling a bit sick due to having an unfortunate mix of both caffeine and fruits (which is a combination that makes my stomach hurt, and I have thrown up before due to it being the only thing I had eating through the day), and I didn't want to take any chances for tomorrow, and so I decided to actually eat more solid foods so I wouldn't possibly throw up or feel sick. \n\nSo far I'm feeling a lot better physically, but I was still not able to follow with my restriction plan and I'm feeling really guilty, stressed, and anxious, especially with the thought of not being able to restrict properly throughout the next week. Any time I overeat and feel guilty, instead of finding food to be brain fuel, I end up just feeling to stressed and angry at myself to focus, which is what I'm feeling now despite desperately wanting to study more. Honestly, I've tried reasoning with myself to say that it's okay for one day and I can restrict again tomorrow, but I'm just unable to calm myself. I'm feeling horrible right now, but the reality of just how deep I'm into this disorder really hits differently on days like these. I'm starting my life, about to go to college, pursue my dreams, and yet nothing means much of anything nowadays. Every day, the only thing I look forwards to is how I'm going to restrict. The days all feel dull and seem to go by too slow and too fast at the same time, with the main thing I'm ever concerned about is not eating. I hate this but I can't stop. I wish I could be normal for even just one day."

A few things I remember was that the episode ended with him reuniting with his lost daughter who he had kept locked up in a house for some time before the agents found them. The one notable thing I clearly remember happening however, was that one of the agents (maybe Luke or Daniel?), were stationed at the house of one of the young women who had the possibility of being targeted by the unsub, and also happened to be flirted with at one point by this girl even though she was quite younger. I think it also had a detail about the mother (or mother in law?) having a fake name to hide the paternity of her children. Sorry, the exact details are pretty unclear in my mind, but could anybody possibly have a clue about the episode I'm referring to?"

I especially liked how they went beyond the formalities of romance and they broke a sort of barrier when it came to wreaking havoc around the school. Jason was especially aware of his destructiveness and it didn't bother him.\n\nSo if you know any movies that cover these topics or are similar in experience, please share!"

I am into LORE of YOKOVERSE and the playlist is already done so I do not mind sharing.\n\n(The playlist will be updated...)\n\nHere is link:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR9p4-oLrUbTkCUD68Km7iC7HgeZVnJij](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR9p4-oLrUbTkCUD68Km7iC7HgeZVnJij)"

It seems like clock's are  going down because of power spikes of GPU when PSU is not able to cover them. What do you think? Should I upgrade my PSU (to 850 or 1000 W) or should I be worried about GPU? (I recently upgraded from 3060 Ti - I had non problems before with the same hardware and same settings - only one thing is different and that's power draw...)."

I don't know. Currently way too many people treat crypto like the stock market, which makes it behave similarly. \n\n\n\nCould it happen? Yes. Once enough people stop funding greedy corporations and start caring more about the people like them, not above them, it's probably when they'll vote with their money towards what matters more. Perhaps CBDC will scare enough people. Perhaps posts like that dude who had his entire portfolio frozen with Vanguard who had to prove where did the funds come from in the last 25y will too. Or perhaps, nothing will ever change, but the newer generations will just have more questions than the previous ones and realize that decentralized money is better. \n\n\nThe day we see crypto and the stock market moving in different directions is the day we'll know for sure."

There were flashbacks about its creation and purpose, with a focus on the scientists.  I believe it was the FAR future, as in the AI in charge of controlling the database was starting to shut down due to wear, and I believe it ended on someone (an alien?) finally reaching it before it broke down completely, thus ending on a hopeful note for humanity.\n\nDetails are fuzzy, not entirely sure if my plot beats are correct, but I remember it moving me!

It was my first board, and I'd like it to go to a good home.  However, as with all first boards, it is not without its issues:\n\n* There is the slightest shine on the keys.\n\n* The stabilized keys are a little finicky; sometimes they stick down on the stabs and I have to realign them gently to type smoothly again.  Not sure how to fix the problem permanently, but it's ONLY with this keycap set. It's probably a Tai-Hao thing.\n\n* SA sets will need some tape on top of the spacebar stabs to keep the spacebar on.  \n\n* One of the stabs is also a loose under the numpad + key, but it isn't noticeable except when removing the keycaps. Aligning the keycap gently (as with the other stabilized key issue) lets it type just fine.\nPrice: **$130**\n\n\nTimestamps: [Board + Accessories,](https://i.imgur.com/bqqxwCr.jpg) [Switch/LED Modifications,](https://i.imgur.com/cPnSD7b.jpg) [Problem Numpad stabilizer](https://i.imgur.com/sTg1T8g.jpg)\n\n\nSA Dasher numpad: Lightly used.  Price: **$60**\n\n\n104x Cherry MX Clears: Harvested from the WASD v2 originally.  Price: **$35**\n\n\nVortex Core stock caps: This is the older red/blue legend version, no green legends.  Price: **$12**\n\n\n125x O-Rings: 40A-L (0.2mm) from WASD Keyboards.  Price: **$12**\n\n\n[Timestamps for all of the above](https://i.imgur.com/fUYfxrB.jpg)\n\n\nI'm also looking for a white Plum Niz 87, preferably with 55g domes, though not required since they can be purchased from Niz's site.  I'd be willing to buy it from you or trade some of the above toward the price.  Thanks for looking!"

I had a hospital social worker call me a liar (to others) since he in his infinite wisdom and 20 min conversation with my mom the day he met her was sure that she was 100% cognitively apt and capable of continuing to live at home, you know, one year past her official Alzheimer's/vascular dementia diagnosis by GP and gerontologist, 6 months past a psychosocial assessment that deemed her inapt, and after me having lived with her for five months and having called an ambulance when she fell twice in one day. But yeah he definitely \"knows better\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, you had a really terrible situation and your reactions are all very reasonable reactions to that type of terrible. You deserve to come first. I hope you can find a therapist who understands. PROPER therapy is amazing and can help so much.

So by definition it cant be changed to suit the humans practicing it, since it's a constant. I mean I became an atheist after trying to be more relegious and devout as a muslim. I thought to myself as a muslim I need to learn everything about my faith so as to obey all of Allah's words and escape any chance of hypocrisy. But the more I looked into relegion the more ridiculous it seemed. And I'm a science loving person, so I was able to quickly find contradictions and errors within it.

I want to talk to someone every night and have deep conversations and feel safe with them. However, any time that I think that I might be interested in someone, conversations with that person are difficult, scary, and unenjoyable. Even if I succeed and \"pass\", I can't feel comfortable enough to fulfill any of my needs. At this point, I've stopped trying. I have friends, but they're not people that I show myself to.\n\nMy question is chiefly this: Will I meet someone some day who suddenly makes all of this go away? Am I just talking to the wrong people? Or do I have to be terrified and tense and bored first to eventually feel safe with someone?\n\nI would greatly appreciate guidance. Especially from folks who have found their somebodies."

Manhattan is especially overwhelming for me and I feel there must be better options out there.\n\nI am also skeptical about Los Angeles and Atlanta because I hate the heat. I like being able to bundle up and I\u2019ve been living in upstate New York because of it. Los Angeles also seems like I wouldn\u2019t like it because I have no intentions of ever driving a car at this point.

But also, I know that these games will end up behaving like Emerald does all the time, where shiny hunting is near-impossible unless you have an early shiny frame.\n\nHowever, my question is this: If you replace the battery, do shinies appear as normal? Because in these games, if you replace the battery, time-based events like berries will not occur until you restart your save file, due to the way that it does the math. Is there any possibility that this same math is used to generate whether or not a Pokemon is shiny?\n\nAny insight would be much appreciated. I already replaced the battery, but I'd like to avoid shiny hunting in a game that can't produce shinies normally."

If we answer vaguely, he goes \"Oh, but how are you REALLY feeling?\"  \n\\- Opens up each class with \"Did anybody have any interesting thoughts since our last class? Any epiphanies? Anything deep?\"  \n\\- Gave us an assignment to watch two films that we would not have otherwise chosen to watch and go out of our comfort zone.  \n\\- Very disorganized with dates and sticking to the syllabus, but does not care, because he's just here to help students grow as people. Some people in the class seem very frustrated with this because they want clear-cut instruction on what to do.\n\n**Rhetorical Studies Professor:**  \n\\- Tries really hard to remain apolitical, but inevitably ends up on a tangent about how deceptive the Republican party has been  \n\\- Stays connected with past students and has them come to visit and talk to the new class about the field \u2014 ends up making small talk because she wants to know how they're doing\n\n**Rhetorical Studies TA:**  \n\\- 237 unread text messages  \n\\- No exceptions to the way things are outlined on the syllabus  \n\\- Drinks kombucha  \n\\- Refused to admit that a definition on her slideshow was wrong, because she had gotten the definition from the professor, therefore I must be wrong.\n\n**Sociology Professor:**  \n\\- Tries to include all of the perspectives on sociology, but does not refrain from saying \"Yeah, guys, we have to talk about this but you really shouldn't agree with these guys, it was used to harm people.\"  \n\\- Doesn't require cameras to be on, as to not make people uncomfortable, but he ends up feeling visibly uncomfortable because he's talking to a blank screen.  \n\\- Everything that he says is on the slides, in paragraph form.  \n\\- Though it's inherent to sociology, it's still important to recognize that he's all about the \"sociological imagination,\" or imagining the consequences of actions on every individual in the population. (What affects me a certain way will affect you a different way based on our own situations)  \n\\- Has a ton of books on his shelf behind him at his home office. So. Many. Books.  \n\\- During the pandemic he has turned into a sort of stay-at-home-dad when he is not teaching on zoom."

Searching piper here didn't get anything similar so here we go:\n\nCommander: The Prismatic Piper (choosing red) & Livio, Oathsworn Sentinel\n\nDecklist: [\\[Piper commander storm v2.0\\]](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/rvJcDgh3BUWhANOai0La_w) [\\[Can Piper EDH? v1.0\\]](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/VdWf_rQ0_0egQkjENpUo_g)\n\nPrice: v1.0: $45.73 [\\[Imgur Screenshot\\]](https://i.imgur.com/pDLjM6a.png) v2.0: $46.46 [\\[Imgur Screenshot\\]](https://i.imgur.com/93KRpFx.png)\n\n# Goal:\n\nMake infinite mana and then cast piper for infinite amount of times. win with sac-outlet pings or other payoffs.\n\n# Game plan:\n\nThe deck's goal is to ramp and assemble infinite mana combo. The intended combos are as follows:\n\nLivio + Village bell-ringer + mana dorks: By pseudo blinking bell-ringer, you can untap Livio and all other mana dorks, they need to produce more then 3WW to go infinite (lesser if Zirda is out)\n\nZirda + Basalt monolith: The very famous Zirda combo, tap for CCC and untap for CC.\n\nBasalt monolith + Toy maker + Voltaic construct: turn Basalt monolith into an artifact creature, then untap for CC with Voltaic construct\n\nMulti-mana land +  Mishra's Groundbreaker: Animate the land into a artifact creature, then combine with the combo pieces for infinite mana.\n\nAfter getting infinite mana, try to infinitely cast The Prismatic Piper and sacrifice it. If there are no sac outlet and you can make infinite white mana, Livio can act as a pseudo sac by exiling TPP and put it back into the commander zone. In this case, Flamekin herald can let you use TPP to cascade the deck until you find a good sac outlet.\n\nIf the combo has failed, still try to cast TPP and Livio as many times as you can, then swing in with many angels with Empyrial Storm and another turn with chance for glory."

                "body": "We literally live in a world where being without financial security can be life or death, and even the quality of life vastly varies if you are not relatively secure. I think financial safety is a priority for most, especially if they have ever experienced being not well-off, or the threat of losing that. Hell, people who are 18 now are living thru a second recession.\n\nThere\u2019s this idea that women want well-off men. It hasn\u2019t barely been half a century since women in america could even open their own bank accounts. Imagine the freedom alone they did not experience from being in control of their own money, or being able to save it, have a credit line. There\u2019s also been a lot of consumerist driven escapism that\u2019s been shoved down most people\u2019s throats, slyly and openly. The people that do think money buys happiness, status, and that status is important are hardly just women. But essentially, there was some reason, as there always has been, for people, which includes women, for wanting to have some financial freedom and affluence thru a partner is one way to do that.\n\nThese days, anxieties about money, material conditions, etc aren\u2019t extinct for men or women. However \u2014 most people are just regular human beings (although perhaps they forget what matters when they live half their lives on and consuming people\u2019s experiences through the internet, I wanna quit instagram so badly myself).\n\nUltimately, a few things to keep in mind: Women are not a monolith. Most are pretty happy earning on their own. Yes there are people who put more emphasis on financial affluence or security than others, plenty of men do too, they have reasons for that too. And also there are plenty who do not want to be obscenely well off, just comfortable. Money does not in fact buy happiness, (it *does* substantially affect quality of life up to a certain amount and being in poverty can literally change your physiology from the stress), plenty of people with money aren\u2019t in relationships or happy ones, and plenty of people without a crap ton *are* in happy relationships.",

IT.)\n- I tend to abuse things like soda and junk food and such because they\u2019re fun and taste good\n- I mostly spend time in my room\n- I tend to at the same time set productive things for myself which I know will be beneficial, but then again, I THINK of them but I don\u2019t actually do them because...lazy\n- I like making guitar music\n- I tend to love abstract media and movies like the Shining (my favorite movie) and such\n- Normally I don\u2019t care for how I look but will care once there is an event or something like that\n- I hate improvising in things such as presentations and such and generally most important things but at the same time in conversations or casual things and such I just go along and say what comes to mind\n- I as a child tended to find a passion or interest and researched absolutely everything about it but then moved on once it got old or boring and did that a lot but now it doesn\u2019t really happen, maybe I just ran out of passions idk\n- Very monotone and poker faced, often called robotic\n- I\u2019m sure once I press \u201cPost\u201d then some ideas I wish were here will come in...well that\u2019s why we have \u201cEdit\u201d\n- When listening to music I love I get transported to an alternate and depressed realm but back to reality once it ends (only for \u201cthe\u201d music I love)\n- Hate it when told to socialize or \u201ccheer up\u201d\n- Don\u2019t really enjoy logic puzzles and such, stressful and tiring\n- Often relate to the underdog\n- Have studied typology for 2 years\n- When in a group at school or with someone I feel a strange mixture of wanting to make them feel good or fit in but also not wanting to...it\u2019s pretty weird\n- Hate it when logic, facts, or efficiency are sacrificed for the sake of emotions or values\n- Will counter-argue for any type you give me\n- Always think of times where something doesn\u2019t apply as well\n- Only friends are my two best friends from middle school\n- Don\u2019t care to clean up anything\n- Tend to want a plan and roles in a group project and can offer them if no one else is\n\nIf anyone wants any more information then please ask because I\u2019m sure I\u2019m leaving a lot out but I just don\u2019t realize them yet."

What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am 15 year old male. I am entering sophomore year in high school and have been studying the functions for two years but have gotten nowhere.\n\n* Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability\n\nI don\u2019t have any mental condition that is medically diagnosed. At least, I don\u2019t think so, I haven\u2019t been to the doctors in a while. I have been to a psychologist though.\n\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI was described as quiet, and a VERY well behaved kid who never really did anything wrong. And was just generally bubbly. But then my parents divorced when I was five. After that traumatic experience I was much more serious, reclusive, and private. I also lived with my mom mostly. And whenever I visited my dad every two weeks on the weekend and Ibhad to leave, I either cried or just had so much shitty emotions just fighting inside of me. Me and my family are Muslims and I was raised that way and still am. It\u2019s not controlling but we live my Islamic principles and teachings. In terms of school I always did well, not a topper but mostly A\u2019s and some B\u2019s. Currently though I have a goal of making it to the top universities (Harvard and such) to study computer science and become a software engineer (I usually have my future life planned, it has changed, but now it\u2019s \u201csolidified\u201d). And now I DO try and be on top in school and at most things I do and I get really sad or pessimistic if I feel like I\u2019m failing. I also have a tendency to overthink, a lot, and make things more complicated than they have to be. Elementary was an absolute breeze for me. Middle hit like a trick because of the aggressive transition but I still did very well. It was also in middle where I tried to be more social and I put effort into my body and style since I thought there were things wrong with me and wanted to be high in the social ladder and get girls attentions and such.....it didn\u2019t work lmao. Girls either just disliked me or I got friend zoned, I did do better with the guys, and I did get two best friends for life out of it. While I was \u201ctrying\u201d, I couldn\u2019t help my natural state which is awkward and reclusive/quiet. People saw this and went to the more loud people. I felt inferior all the time and even tried to research tips and tricks to attract girls and be charismatic, didn\u2019t work, my awkward ass never let any of that happen. So after that bad experience in middle, I am a loner with not much need for socialization and spend most of my time just alone, in my room, coding or being on YouTube, working on any project I have or making ways to further my goal, and gaming. And I\u2019m happy like this. For some reason I never feel TOO happy though. Idk why. I also have this stress or anxiety whenever there is \u201cchange\u201d or unfamiliarity in my life. I like things to be generally the same. I have a really strict comfort zone which I don\u2019t venture out of much at all. And since I was young I\u2019ve had this thing where I have a burning interest for something and I am able to remember every fact or details about my passion, liek for example I was super into dinosaurs one time and was able to name most of them. And one time I was really into cars and was able to name the model and horsepowers of all the ones I\u2019ve gathered up. But then after a while and after my passion dies down, I just move on to something else. Suddenly as well. This was so common back then but now it doesn\u2019t happen too much, I am really into programming at the moment though and intend to make it my career.\n\n* What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nHigh school sophomore. I really dislike the subjects I\u2019m not interested in but I try and do my best in all of them, I really do. I do have a tendency to do the least amount of work while getting the most credit out of it, and IF I can, I cheat. I see high school mostly just as a stepping stone for my future, not much more than that. I also have trouble with time management and procrastination but I wish I didn\u2019t because it\u2019s actually ruining me a bit. I just get SO \u201cnot in the mood\u201d to work, but I do have a voice at the back of my head which tells me \u201cyou need to do this, you know what right?\u201d And then I feel guilty procrastinating my ass off later on. I also disagree with the system, it\u2019s not even a place of learning anymore, it\u2019s a place of stress, anxiety, conformity, and memorizing then regurgitating information onto papers. Not all kids are the same or learn the same. One size doesn\u2019t fit all.\n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by \nyourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI\u2019d feel fantastic spending a weekend with myself and I want to do it so bad but always have to have people and my family around. Once I move out and have my freedom though...then that\u2019ll be fun. I do love my parents, but I would like a weekend to myself. I\u2019d only start to get lonely and bored after a WHILE of doing it. But it takes a lot to get there.\n\n* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?\n\nI observe my surroundings a lot. I do love football and would play it outside, other than that, I dislike the outdoors and would much rather be inside. I only like outdoors for football, walking, peace, that\u2019s it. Rest of the time, I\u2019m cooped up inside. \n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI\u2019m curious about things I give a damn about. I\u2019m much more curious about STEM things (science, space, technology, etc.) rather than arts and humanities things. I do love music though. I know how to play some guitar. I\u2019d say my ideas are a mix or environmental and conceptual. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m the most creative person.\n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI much prefer just being rogue, but if I HAD to choose between leader or follower, I\u2019d choose leader. I feel like I\u2019d be good at it because I\u2019d be open to my followers and hear them out and consider what it is they bring to the table. I would be the type where I\u2019m like \u201cI don\u2019t care how you do it, just have a finished and well made product at this time, go off.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t micro-manage unless someone is just being plain stupid. I would keep an eye on most people but I\u2019d be more laid back.\n\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI\u2019d say I\u2019m coordinated with things I know how to do. To me it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t know how to do something thoroughly then I\u2019ll be uncoordinated because I don\u2019t have all the details first and foremost. I prefer a more practical approach rather than a theoretical one since this is how you actually learn. I\u2019d say I\u2019m mostly inactive but will go for walks and stuff like that, or ride bikes, swim or play football like I mentioned earlier. Other than those, I\u2019m sitting most of the day.\n\n* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI\u2019m a very bad artist, I can be really deep and metaphorical with things like poetry, writing, and lyrics and stuff like that, but I\u2019m the worst drawer/painter you\u2019ll ever see. I don\u2019t do art typically but I can, if I want to write a song for example or I need to vent by writing out or typing something, this skill in deep writing comes in handy in English class lol. Worst at \u201cart\u201d though in terms of what it usually means (drawing and painting or crafts). I\u2019m a science and math person generally.\n\n* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nSometimes I become scatterbrained about the future and my mom literally has to tell me to calm down, stop trying to be 10 steps ahead because it\u2019s not possible, and take it one step at a time and to focus on the present affairs. This only happens with work or school related stuff. Most of the time I\u2019m just focusing on what is happening now though, sometimes I\u2019m also up in the past. I\u2019d say I\u2019m balanced with past, present, and future. I do indulge in the past a little more than the future, I look at the future in specific cases while I can get real nostalgic and hold onto and explore things from my childhood or past. But generally and in my default state I\u2019m just in the present moment doing what it is I\u2019m doing. I do have a tendency to look at past experiences to determine whether to do something (for example since I had a bad experience with socializing, I don\u2019t want to do it, or since this place has always had good food, I\u2019ll eat there). \n\n* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIf they genuinely need help then I\u2019ll gladly come over and see what\u2019s up, but if it\u2019s something that can just be figured out then I\u2019ll just tell them the solution. I\u2019d come and help if it\u2019s something that just can\u2019t be reasoned out or can be given advice to. A note is that if what they need help with is stupid or it interrupts something I wanted to I\u2019ll grumble inside but still help out.\n\n* Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes I think it\u2019s important. I do pay attention to it generally and get annoyed when someone has a lack of it. For me PERSONALLY (without external things), I do things that I feel like doing or make me happy, doesn\u2019t always have to be logical even though if I\u2019m aware of it I\u2019ll try and make sure it is but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s my \u201cdefault\u201d position. My logic is more externally focused generally (peoples reasons, critiquing outside systems or things, etc.). On the outside I\u2019m more logical and serious but in the inside is where my feelings and things like that reside.\n\n* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nTo me it\u2019s important and something I try to be better at. Now. I think it\u2019s important, with things that are actually important. I don\u2019t give a crap about productivity in terms of chores and things like that. I mean it in getting work done and getting ahead in life. Making my bed is so trivial but as a kid am forced to do it even though I think household things are generally stupid and just waste good time.\n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nNot really, I try and stay OUT of peoples business, but if we are working together on a project, I do like to have a plan set up and will try and make sure people do their part, I\u2019ll control in that way.\n\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI\u2019m more of a visual learner, I can get confused a lot of information or text which is too vague or \u201cheavy\u201d, but once I\u2019m shown a picture or demo of how it works then I understand quick. Light information I can handle and piece together though. Im not sure why I work this way. I prefer classes where I do things more often rather than a lecture based on rote memorization. Creativity is good but I\u2019m not THAT creative so that\u2019s not a complete yes from me. Logic is also important in class.\n\n* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI\u2019m good at thinking things through step by step and in detail. I also try and counter negative outcomes or possibilities. I break up projects into smaller bits and just do them, I procrastinate but I try and break it down into steps and daily procedures. Sometimes I have to bunch a couple of them on the same day though because I might have procrastinated, I\u2019m the weirdest combo of J and P just saying. I don\u2019t like singing and improvising since it\u2019s more stressful and I like to be competent. And I\u2019m not the best with coming up with witty things on the spot.\n\n* What's important to you and why?\n\nWhat\u2019s important to me is staying true to yourself and being the best version of yourself. Staying true to yourself with only make you happier and filter out incompatible people in your life and is less tiring. And being the best version of yourself is central to everything in life whether it\u2019s school, relationships, work, religion, anything.\n\n* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI fear being a failure in life. What makes me uncomfortable is the \u201cnew\u201d or different, doing things which I don\u2019t feel are right. I hate people who make no sense and/or try and push illogical authority onto others. I also hate injustice and unfairness, not on a global scale but on personal matters. I\u2019m pretty apathetic towards global problems since it doesn\u2019t concern me. I also hate petty annoyances like when someone coughs too much, too loud or talkative, cringe, smacking, things like these. I also hate things which I \u201chave\u201d to do even though they conflict with what I want to do or intended.\n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nMy highs are when I achieve or succeed at what I do, but it doesn\u2019t happen much. The rush of making it is indescribable. My other highs are the exciting places I\u2019ve been to like Vegas, Disney world, etc.\n\n* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nMy traumatic experiences include the divorce, big changes in my life or different schools, and just general stress or unhappiness with certain things.\n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI\u2019d say I\u2019m more attached to reality since that is what\u2019s real and important. I daydream sometimes but not that much, I prefer doing something (for example I could daydream for about a minute, but then I get bored and get on my phone). I can sometimes zone out in school but I try and pay attention a lot since I want to be amazing. I do pay attention to what\u2019s around me, observing is common for me. When I daydream I don\u2019t totally go off into my own \u201cland\u201d, I\u2019m still sort of aware what\u2019s happening, I can\u2019t help it. My dad describes me as \u201cbeing in my own world all the time\u201d though.\n\n* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI\u2019ll dream about things I\u2019ve seen and play back a lot of things (could be videos I\u2019ve seen, events, anything, I play back a lot). I would also think about what\u2019s beyond the walls, maybe I\u2019m being watched, or maybe this is all a test. These types of thoughts would be going through my mind. I would also think about things I wish I could do or an idea I should scribble down but I can\u2019t so I forget it soon. Stuff like that.\n\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIt depends, if I have all the information and allowed to think it through, I\u2019ll take a while but my decision will be well informed once I do it. I change my mind if new information arises or I realize something else is better.\n\n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI\u2019d say I process through my feelings quite a bit, I\u2019m not sure how long though. I don\u2019t care much for others emotions but I do care about my own. They tell me what to do when I\u2019m with myself or what I feel about something. They constitute my daily \u201cdoings\u201d. For example, I feel like watching TV, now I feel like coding this, now I feel like gaming, etc. Not too logic driven. I prefer logic in the external world. I will absolutely care about logic when taking in information or deciding something but it\u2019s not a majority of my personal actions.\n\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nNo I hate making people believe they are right even though they are logically wrong. It gets in my nerves and I will call them out if something doesn\u2019t make sense. And I don\u2019t care for conversations with people so I don\u2019t have much to lose either, this depends on the person though. But I do not like agreeing for the sake of it. It just bugs me and they\u2019ll go off thinking their lies are true.\n\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\nI don\u2019t think rules should be broken because it\u2019ll do nothing except get you in trouble, it\u2019s stupid. Same with authority, no point of rebelling, just focus on yourself.\n\n* What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\nThe ideal life is happiness with what you have and where you end up."

                "body": "Hey, I'm relatively new to this. I started managing a library of free PDF books around the summer of 2020 that I stored on my Google Drive. When I hit the storage limit I transferred some folders to another account. This was mostly because in the past I've had computers completely lose their files and shit so although I have those files on my laptop's local storage as well I wanted to put them somewhere else for backup.\n\nThe collection of books relatively quickly stemmed into movies and music as well to the point that I'm pretty sure it could be considered piracy. Frankly I'm not a huge tech person and i have a bit of a budget so I've just been using Google Drive and a laptop, as mentioned, but it's a bit of a tedious method to upload any new stuff to Drive and sort it and everything - and I'm mildly concerned about that method because I don't know the security of that and based off Google's history of terminating products kind of out of nowhere I doubt this is a good permanent storage method even if it is secure, which as I mentioned, I doubt it is.\n\nSo I'm wondering if it would be worthwhile to buy some external hard drives to store stuff on. It's a bit pricey but I feel like most stuff would be? HOWEVER I am not all that tech savvy so I have no idea how private this is - I'm not quite sure how a third party could get access to data stored on an external hard drive without physically stealing it but honestly computers are weird and I'd like to know if that's an actual threat. Also, how common would it be for those files to just disappear? Would it be worthwhile to buy extra for backup? Is there anything I could do to minimize the risk?\n\nAnd also, I'm fucking clueless. I've been doing this almost a year but I have no idea how anything works, so like... What are some other methods of storage that are easy enough to get the hang of? Explain like I'm 5, I'm really not knowledgeable about... Anything."

                "body": "1. Was Taylor telling a story of fiction or a story of her own?\n\nRodrigo Prieto shared his experience working with Taylor when they were filming the Cardigan music video. Prieto said, *\"Swift came up with a detailed shot list for the video ahead of time, with each visual accompanied by a time sequence within the song. The ocean water, the fingers on the piano, whatever it may be, she knew what she wanted for each section.\"* Of course, I'm sure we didn't expect anything less from Taylor let alone when it came to directing the music video of folklore's single.\n\nHowever, what Prieto said later was interesting. *\"This video is not just pretty images of things; she\u2019s telling a personal story through her lyrics, her music, and now through the video\".* What 'personal story' was she telling? Wasn't the entire album supposed to be fiction? Did the cinematographer who brought Taylor's storyline to life sensed that Taylor was telling her own personal story by how specific the storyline she presented him with?\n\n2. Portrait of a Lady on Fire references : pure inspiration or metaphors for her own personal experiences?\n\nWe know what I'm talking about. It's the resemblance between Taylor's ocean scene and the scene where Marianne, the main character, jumped into the ocean to get her canvas that fell into the water.\n\nI believe this reference was beyond just a reenactment that was inspired by the movie. I believe the movie itself felt familiar to Taylor. The secrets between Marianne and Heloise, the paintings of Heloise that Marianne painted that immortalized their love, the inevitable ending between the two women when Heloise proceeded to marry her husband, the secret codes that only the two lovers understood, all of these things could easily be familiar experiences to closeted queers and maybe Taylor could see herself in the characters.\n\nSo, I believe that every shot in the music video was crafted to be metaphors to tell a story of her own.\n\n3. Taylor's piano and Marianne's canvas : a metaphor for the way they immortalized their love\n\nThe first scene from Cardigan was when Taylor was facing an old piano. Taylor tried to emphasize that the piano was old by showing that it was dusty and one of the piano keys was broken. I'm not sure why she chose the broken key to be the B key. Easiest guess is Betty but I feel like this is one of those things where only Taylor and someone else understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[broken key and dusts on the piano](https://preview.redd.it/4l8930dx1vd71.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b991b9802473c38868df7f3f602fa51b721dab70)\n\nIt's interesting that Taylor chose to start the video with this scene of her playing an old abandoned piano, as if she was about to bring the audience to a time when the piano was more than an old piano in an isolated cabin. This is similar to the the start of POALOF when Marianne asked her students who brought out the POALOF which was also the only remaining painting of Heloise that was in Marianne's possession.\n\nMarianne : Who brought that painting out?\n\nStudent : (raises her hand) From the stock. Shouldn't I have?\n\nThe exchange between Marianne and the student emphasized that the only painting in Marianne's possession that reminded her of Heloise was indeed old, abandoned and hidden somewhere out of sight, just like Taylor's piano from the first scene.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/61ta2ctb4vd71.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b89f5152cf788936fb1ffe412c12b34370177b64\n\nBoth movies started with the main characters interacting with the tools that helped to immortalize their love. Marianne was looking at a painting she painted which was the only way she knew how to express her emotions and her stories because she was a painter. Taylor started playing the piano in the cabin which symbolized her songwriting process because songwriting would always be the only way for her to tell her stories. Marianne had her canvas and Taylor had her piano.\n\nDuring the first scenes, both women were about to go back into the past and tell the stories of how they found and lost their lovers.\n\n4. Cliff scene : metaphor for when she was happy\n\nAt the start of this scene it's important to note the condition of the piano. Unlike the piano from the cabin, this piano was a grand piano, it was covered with moss, it was white, the lid was raised, it wasn't hidden between the four walls of the cabin. It was still isolated in the middle of the forest but the sun was out, it was bright and Taylor was visibly happy. Also note that before Taylor started playing the piano, the piano was dry and wasn't yet creating a waterfall.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t8bteqwjbvd71.jpg?width=849&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a31de31c8bde1c07faeb65910a8115e8e9d87b5\n\nAfterwards, Taylor started playing the piano and soon water started flowing out of the piano and it created a waterfall. The cliff scene felt like Taylor was trying to recreate how she felt at the time when her lover was nothing but her one source of happiness. The earth and piano were both covered with moss which could symbolize Taylor being \"covered\" in her lover. The waterfall created from Taylor playing the piano was harmless, it wasn't drowning her. Taylor was just simply enjoying the view of the waterfall that was flowing out of the piano. It was a harmless body of water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fmp3a62pwvd71.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4941ebe493e5145f9fd4cfb066b73b79e0ad4985\n\nAlso, the cliff scene reminded me of this picture. The huge tree by Taylor, the trunk of a fallen tree that looked like a bridge and Taylor looking upwards and around at the start of the scene felt a lot like she was trying to reenact this picture with Karlie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ysymge90bvd71.jpg?width=307&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f282c96bbd4f9b127dfbfcbe0008c2934906f41b\n\n5. Ocean scene : the water was now drowning her\n\na) Waterfall turned into ocean\n\nIf we compare the clear waterfall that was flowing out of the beautiful white grand piano by the cliff to this dark ocean that was quite literally drowning Taylor at the start of the scene, we can maybe conclude that this scene was supposed to be a metaphor for when something bad happened between Taylor and her lover.\n\nIt could be that at the moment when Taylor was still falling in love, she was rudely woken up with the reality of this love. The same body of water that was once harmless and was the source of happiness for Taylor suddenly turned into this dark cold ocean that was drowning her.\n\nb) White piano turned into dark piano\n\nThis feels like its self-explanatory. At the cliff scene, the piano was beautiful. It was covered with moss, it was literally creating a beautiful waterfall but during the ocean scene, the piano was dark and gloomy. The piano could also be a metaphor of how Taylor felt for each scene.\n\nc) Taylor's piano & Marianne's canvas\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxng9j7jfvd71.jpg?width=444&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2ef009fc341d86e9086712686b32c23ca6fbb7c9\n\nThe famous scene from Cardigan where Taylor found herself in an ocean and swam towards the piano that was awfully similar to POALOF's was a lot more than a reenactment. Like Marianne who was swimming towards the canvas that she would paint Heloise on, Taylor swam towards her piano which would be the only way for her to immortalize the story between her and her lover in the form of songs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[folklore on the piano](https://preview.redd.it/qtfn4b5ckvd71.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fde18541aa32c00393cb1157d1c908c8efb7b6fd)\n\nNote that 'folklore' was written on the piano and Taylor later climbed into the piano. This could symbolize that when Taylor lost the love of her life and found herself alone in the ocean, Taylor did the only thing she knew how. She wrote folklore and then later evermore to immortalize their love.\n\n[during the cliff scene, Taylor looked up to see the sun and the tree while during the ocean scene, she looked around to see that she was alone and the sun was down](https://preview.redd.it/rp368u0givd71.jpg?width=464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cdc711e289f880f0183f018bc18a324b8420977b)\n\n6. \"Present Taylor\" was stuck in time\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[from first cabin scene : pay attention to the clock and the candles](https://preview.redd.it/nxmzacujtvd71.jpg?width=745&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3e85542b6f9b467fd14f2c9bd565eda993f034d5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[from final cabin scene : note that the time on the clock never changed and the candles were exactly the same but the piano wasn't dusty yet](https://preview.redd.it/szjwpu1otvd71.jpg?width=742&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d895e5a5279b74f73f7ccdebcab908613a55e94e)\n\nI think the cliff and ocean scenes were from the past while the final cabin scene was the first time Taylor came into the cabin (she lived in seclusion after losing the love of her life). Note that \"final cabin scene Taylor\" was wet from the ocean. Meanwhile, the \"first cabin scene Taylor\" was dry, there were no longer traces of water on her.\n\nThis was perhaps to symbolize that time moved on because there were dusts collected on the piano keys and Taylor was no longer damp. However, the true indications of time from this video which were the clock and candles remained the same. Both the clock and candles didn't change. This could symbolize that to Taylor, she was right where her lover left her. It really gives off RWYLM vibes.\n\n*Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?/Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it/She's still 23 inside her fantasy//*"

Imagine this, you're a closeted singer who has done a pretty good job at being in the closet, covid happened and you had a surge of inspiration to write these songs. You decided to not only write but release a song addressed to a girl named Betty while playing the part of Betty's lover. You understood the consequences, you imagined every possible reaction by everyone who was about to listen to that song, you acknowledged that yearning over a girl named Betty wasn't exactly on brand for your heterosexual self and yet you somehow still decided to release the song?\n\nDo you understand how much courage it took for her to do that? Who and what possessed her to be so brave and release a song that was so obviously about a girl? Forget the boy's perspective. My friends interrupted me when I played Taylor's Betty at ACM to ask me \"is she gay?\" If any other celebrities were to release this song instead of Taylor, they would be queer to the GP by now. \n\nTaylor understood this. Maybe Betty was a brave apology (old or new, real or fiction) even if she hetwash-ed them a few weeks later but during the period between the release and hetwash, Taylor understood the reactions that Betty would provoke and she still went with it. \n\nShe thought about the risks and benefits and decided there were more benefits of releasing this song or was she just brave because it was her craft and decided that being closeted wouldn't stop her from being honest with her music? Or was she \"fishing\" for a certain type of reaction? I'm not referring to queerbaiting but maybe to attract attention back to a certain rumour about her dating a certain old friend? For what? I don't know but I do remember that there were actual articles talking about Karlie when she first released Betty. They weren't talking about Joe Alwyn or her ex boyfriends because it was so clearly about a woman. \n\nI've definitely thought about the possibility of Taylor writing songs with signs that point towards ex girlfriends (for gaylors) and ex boyfriends (for those who believe they were real). She gave everyone everything they wanted to fit their own narratives that they built for her. Of course I'm not discounting the fact that folkmore were heartbreaking (and quite possibly caused by the woman she dated) but that doesn't mean that she didn't write her songs so they could make everyone happy. So that her songs could fit everyone's narrative of her love life. Maybe Betty was for the gaylors to keep them interested and to attract the new ones? Both truths can co-exist. \n\nWhat was she trying to achieve by taking such a huge risk and release Betty?"

                "body": "1. Who were the poets mentioned in The Lakes?\n\nIn her folklore's bonus track, The Lakes, Taylor referred to the Lake District in England, the home to English poets in the first half of the 1900s: William Wordsworth, Samuel Coleridge and Robert Southey. She cleverly mentioned Wordsworth in her song *\"I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze tell me what are my* ***words worth****\"* without being obvious. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Lake District](https://preview.redd.it/2cacgje7nu371.png?width=378&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6f5463495657b0acdbc84e3fd870f91988b32410)\n\nHowever, in The Lakes, Taylor wrote *\"Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die\"*. Poet*s*. While William Wordsworth did die in Lake District, both Samuel Coleridge and Robert Southey did not. The two poets died in London. So, of course inevitably, the next question is, who was the other poet Taylor was referring to other than William Wordsworth? I believe she was referring to Dorothy Wordsworth, a prose writer who influenced the work of an English Romantic poet that launched the Romantic Age in English lit, and a sister to William Wordsworth. Dorothy Wordsworth was not an amateur or simply a \"sister to\" the William Wordsworth, she was one of the first people William turned to to read and criticize his poems. In Taylor's own words, *\"I want auroras and sad prose\"* and who was Dorothy if not known as a writer of proses? \n\nLeave it to Taylor Swift to celebrate a female poet who stayed unrecognized in the shadow of a man who was known for his revolutionary crafts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7bfvubronu371.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=563d615b762a9c78c3abcb148c06bca21ae82708\n\n2. Dorothy Wordsworth: unrecognized gifted writer or humble companion of her brother?\n\nDorothy wrote the Grasmere Journal which contained material on which William took for his poetry. Her description of daffodils in April 1802 inspired his *\"I wandered lonely as a cloud\"*. Dorothy's own poems had been published in William's editions since 1815 but they were never attributed to \"Dorothy Wordsworth\". Thomas De Quincey, the English essayist and critic, averred that Dorothy might, if she chose, have flourished as a *\u201cwriter for the press,\u201d* and that she would deserve a *\u201cseparate notice in any biographical dictionary of our times, had there even been no William Wordsworth in existence\u201d.*\n\nWhy didn't Dorothy leave her brother and start her own journey of being a poet, free of her brother's shadow? William might not have written many of his greatest poems had it not been for Dorothy as her journals provided materials for at least 35 poems. William Heath estimated that at time in 1802, William's sensibility was subordinate to Dorothy's that was reflected in certain poems. How strange was Dorothy to choose to help create the grandest poetry of the century while knowing that she wouldn't get the acknowledgment she deserved? Maybe that's a na\u00efve question when asked by a woman who lives in 2021.\n\nI wonder if Taylor took her time during quarantine or years before that to study about Dorothy as a poet, learn what an unfortunate blessing it was to be a female poet in the early 1900s and vaguely dedicated a part of The Lakes to Dorothy? How much of herself did Taylor see in Dorothy Wordsworth?\n\n3. Dorothy Wordsworth: asexual or a lesbian? \n\nDorothy was never married and believed to die a virgin and that leaves us with the question: was she stereotypically unattractive like so many Victorian women, asexual, or as few believed- a lesbian? \n\nRegarding Dorothy, De Quincey stated, *\"Immediately behind her (Mary Wordsworth, William's wife) moved a lady (Dorothy), shorter, slighter\".* When talking about her features, he said *\"Her face was of Egyptian brown; rarely in a woman of English birth, had I seen a more determinate gypsy tan. Her eyes were not soft as Mrs. Wordsworth's, nor were they fierce or bold; but they were wild and startling, hurried in their motion\"*. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Dorothy Wordsworth](https://preview.redd.it/melib4xmou371.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=11668cd7b0be14ad1229fd736c2b6bde8bcafef8)\n\nHowever, it was also De Quincey who hinted in his description of her that he thought she was a lesbian but he also hinted that he was in love with her and that she rejected him. In an essay he wrote about her for *Tait's Edinburgh Magazine*, De Quincey said that he was not the only man to have *\"loved and admired you in your fervid prime\"*. It was also De Quincey who believed she had received *\"several offers,\"* one of them was from William Hazlitt. All these *\"offers,\"* were *\"without a moment's hesitation, rejected decisively\".* \n\nWe can easily conclude that Dorothy was asexual or as De Quincey described, *\"a sterile bud\"*. However, there was nothing in Dorothy's writing that suggested she wasn't passionate in love, romance, or indifferent to her physical environment. She was someone acutely alert to the pleasures of senses! In The Ballad of Dorothy Wordsworth, Frances Wilson said that she didn't not experience or excite desire but *\"that the idea of her doing so makes her readers so uncomfortable.\"*\n\nMaybe they oversimplified the complicated nature of Dorothy's sexuality and desires, as it probably wasn't in their best interest to discuss about a woman who lived without expressing her sexual needs towards men. It was easier to think that she wasn't able of feeling sexual desires while dismissing the inconsistency of that statement when we study her passionate crafts, instead of thinking that maybe her sexual desires lay elsewhere.\n\nFrances also wrote that while they seemed to understand that Dorothy understood William's morbid moods and illnesses arose from sexual-repression and that he should marry, they failed to consider that sexual repression were something Dorothy could suffer herself. If she was suffering from sexual repression, why didn't she accept the *\"several offers\"* like De Quincey said? Or was she simply not that interested in men?\n\n4. Dorothy Wordsworth & Jane Pollard : childhood friends or secret lovers?\n\nJane Pollard met Dorothy Wordsworth when she was six after Dorothy's mother died. Jane's affection was a consolation and Dorothy remembered her nine years in Halifax as among her happiest until Dorothy left for Halifax when she was 15. That was the beginning of countless letters addressed to her *\"dear, dear Jane\"* that started immediately after her departure. The two friends exchanged letters until a few years before Jane's death and were \"reunited\" when Jane and her husband, John Marshall moved to Hallstead, Lake District in the 1830s to join the Wordsworth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Jane Marshall \\(nee Pollard\\)](https://preview.redd.it/m3ahukovpu371.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=db2652f18890f7c5caf320e483973ae540873d51)\n\nAmong other things, Dorothy's letters to Jane were filled with how she longed to meet Jane, how she imagined their \"reunion\" if Jane were to come visit her and how she recalled walking in the woods with Jane back in Cockermouth. \n\na. Halifax, December 7th, 1787. Dorothy Wordsworth to Jane Pollard \n\n*\"Oh! That I could but see you! How happy we should be! I really think that for an hour after our meeting there could be nothing pass betwixt us but tears of joy, fits of laughter, and unconnected exclamations. It is now seven months since we parted. We have never been separated for these nine years-\".*\n\nInterestingly, Dorothy said something in this letter that reminded me of a certain song of Taylor. \n\n*\"(while writing to Jane), I assure you I am a very skillful* ***architect****. I have so many different plans of building our castle, so many contrivances! Do you ever build castles?\".*\n\nAlexa, play I Think He Knows. While the promise made by Dorothy to Jane of building \"their\" castle seemed innocent and could be translated into sisterly love and Dorothy's denial of them inevitably growing up and apart, there was also a hint of beyond platonic affection in that promise. It felt almost the same as that borderline platonic-romantic nature of spending 4 nights a week in your girl friend's dorm room while abandoning your first college boyfriend. Anyone else? No?\n\nb. Forncett, February 16, 1793. DW to JP\n\n*\"I look forward to the happiness of receiving you in my little parsonage. I hope you will spend at least a year with me. I have laid the particular scheme of happiness for each season. When I think of winter, I hasten to furnish our little parlour. When close the shutters, set out the tea-table - (and she proceeded to describe a lovely time with Jane in her parsonage if they were to be reunited).*\n\nWhere was this honey sweet talk for all the eligible English bachelors, Dorothy?\n\n3. Forncett, 1793. DW to JP. \n\n*\"(describing her evening stroll)- but oh! How imperfect is my pleasure. I am alone. I hear you pointed out a spot where, if we could erect a little cottage and call it our own, we could be the happiest of human beings-- our garden is adorned by magic; the roses and they honeysuckle spring at our command-\"*\n\nPicturing yourself and your childhood friend building a little cottage so you could live happily ever after with a pretty garden in the back? Lesbians. Dorothy Wordsworth started the lesbian cottagecore aesthetic. I rest my case. \n\n5. Did Taylor see herself in Dorothy Wordsworth and used William Bowery as a fa\u00e7ade to create queer-coded songs?\n\nYes, I think a part of Taylor saw herself in Dorothy for the reasons I mentioned above. Between Dorothy criticizing William's crafts before they were published, her journals providing raw materials for William's poems and several of Dorothy's own poems published in William's editions and them never directly attributed to \"Dorothy Wordsworth\" (or in Taylor's case, attributed to only \"Taylor Swift\") I do believe that songs \"written\" by William Bowery acted as reflections of William Wordsworth's poems that were illuminated by Dorothy's (Taylor's) ideas. William Bowery was Taylor's own pseudonym. If she were to write queer-coded songs, why not choose a pseudonym that was also the name of a male poet who was at times dependent of his sister's ideas? His sister that was underappreciated for her work? Taylor does love her dead female poets with gay rumours."

You've come a long way and I'm sure your younger self would be immensely proud of yourself. Take some time to revel in that.\n\nBefore being enterprising, you said you want to be something in this world. What is your definition of success? Do you want to be one of those large-company executives? Do you want to be a millionaire? You have to determine what your definition of success is before you go on a journey to obtain it.\n\nAfter you decide what you want to do/be (and it's okay if your definition of success changes), you should do something, anything, that gets the ball rolling. If you need to develop leadership skills, go find opportunities to nurture that. If you desire better technical skills or to create your own tech company, start your own projects. Not just one project, but many projects. It's very rare that someone's first commerical product is a homerun. Build projects, fail, learn, and continue. If you don't know what an entrepreneurial plan for a project looks like, conduct a lot of research, talk to a lot of people, try, fail, and keep trying. Obviously it's a lot easier said than done, but I think the biggest thing is getting out of your head and get started on what you want to do.\n\nI'm in the same boat as OP for my desire - I want to be an entrepreneur. I've tried starting many projects, rarely finish them, and barely gone through any non-tech process. Idk how I'm going to learn the business and marketing sides of entrepreneurship without any school curriculums, but it's better I try, learn, and fail now rather than try, learn, and fail 20yrs from now when I have more responsibilities (eg. employees, investors). If anything, all the times you went out and tried now (and possibly fail) is going to make your success story more awesome.",

If done properly, you will find out if people are willing to pay for your product or not, and if not, why not. If it isn't a problem worth paying for almost anyone, this is in your best interest as you can pivot and not waste additional time or money.",

                "body": "My AP are emotionally distant from each other and I am 100% positive it is because of my paternal grandmother (my mom\u2019s MIL). My paternal grandmother is an interesting specimen. She\u2019s nosy and continually wants to hold all the leverage and power she can. If some family members are having a conversation in the living room where she is watching TV and we laugh, she\u2019ll want to know what it was about. If we put on outside clothes, she\u2019ll want to know where we are going. You cannot have more power than her, otherwise, you know something bad is going to happen to you soon. She\u2019ll steal things from myself and my mom, either use it like it\u2019s hers or give it to others to use, and then keep our belongings for herself.\n\nShe\u2019ll make assumptions about people and situations (eg. anyone not in her immediate family, even excluding grandchildren) and judge them on her limited point of view, and none of her adult children will correct her. If they try, she won\u2019t listen to anyone and instead get angry/start hating on the person who brought up the issue. In that situation, she even has the tendency of playing victim and getting her adult children to \u201cdefend\u201d her and reprimand the \u201caccuser\u201d.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen and heard, she\u2019s been antagonizing my mother for all of my parents\u2019 marriage. She\u2019ll order my mom to do/buy stuff when we visit from traveling several hours away even when her adult children live with her. She\u2019ll talk to my mom and then change the entire conversation when relaying it to her adult children, and even call my mom just to say nasty things (eg. \u201cWhen I die, I\u2019m giving all my possessions to my children and their spouses, but you\u201d;  \u201cYou got sick and can\u2019t go on vacation? HAHAHAH. That is so hilarious!\u201d).\n\nThus, it is normal for my mom to desire to cease all contact with her MIL forever, but it puts a strain on my AP\u2019s relationship. My dad (who lives with his parents) always sides with his mom for any fights and can\u2019t listen to any criticism (like his mother). My mom can\u2019t even rant to my dad (her husband) because he just relays conversations and information to his parents (even after constantly telling him not to). Just like my paternal grandmother, my father and his siblings can\u2019t keep a secret. They also guilt-trip me and my mom to visit my grandparents often and are extremely nosy and gossipy.\n\nThankfully, my mom and I live several hours from them. (Unfortunately, I might have to move back in.) I think my dad and his siblings will get better after my grandma leaves, but I don\u2019t want to wait however long for my parents\u2019 relationship to possibly get better. Is there anything I can do to help save my AP\u2019s relationship? Is there anything I can do to prevent learning bad mannerisms/habits from my grandmother and her children?"

I tried doing that once and I felt like there aas so much to unpack and since the religious portion of a conversation never stays present too long, I always felt like there always wasn't enough time to share everything in subsequent conversations.\n\nSo I changed my method and talked to my friends about religion, when they would bring it up or the conversation naturally flowed that way. I have known some of my friends for a good 5-6 years now and they know Christianity is a big part of my life. But I can't help but think they feel hurt/slighted by the fact I don't invite them to church or just fellowship gatherings.\n\nIn fact, I remember someone I like-liked (they like-liked me too) and wasn't a Christian exclaimed, \"Yeah why don't you invite me\" or \"What about me\" when I was inviting another Christian friend to a church event.\n\nEssentially my thought is, say you weren't a Christian but your close friend was a Christian, and you know that Christianity is held in high regard to your dear friend, it seems you would want to try and visit church with them, at least once: to hang out with them, to see what the fuss is about, to understand why they like it, etc."

I don't usually post on Reddit but I will try to fix it, if that is possible. TLDR is the last paragraph.\n\nI've always wanted to learn how to sing but I was always too shy to ask for voice lessons. I was on the children's choir but I didn't get how not to sing with my throat so I never asked. Fast forward 10 years later, I'm in college and trying every new experience I can.\n\nI find a singing class not near home and not near school but the price was cheap and the teacher seemed chill. I would always leave school to travel an hour to the singing place, to travel another hour back to school to study, and then travel two hours to go home. My grades slipped that semester due to all the traveling and lack of studying but I was happy with myself because I was taking a step in the direction that I wanted to live life. I wasn't a good singer; my voice was off-key but in the region of the actual key (so at least I wasn't tone deaf like I thought I was). But I had a cool teacher that didn't judge me and made learning how to sing fun. (She ghosted me later though :(.) \n\nAfter that semester of lessons learned, I realized I needed to continue singing because it kept me sane. So I turned to my friends. We went karaoke a few times for special events until it turned into a casual thing. Meaning I would ask them if they wanted to karaoke on a random day like I would ask others if they wanted to grab food if I was in the area. Holding the mic and singing in front of my friends, albeit nerve-wracking in the beginning, became more fun as I developed a karaoke persona? Like I get to be hella confident for some 3-4 minutes and act like a superstar.\n\nIt's only been 6 weeks into the new year and I've gone to karaoke 4 times already. Apparently that's a lot??? LOL. I want to try going 25 times this year, but we'll see how that goes.\n\nTLDR: But yes, I was studying with my friends yesterday and we started playing/singing to music. And my friend complimented me, \"Ooooh, you've gotten better.\" I was/am happy. When I record myself I can hear myself hitting more proper/the right notes, although I sometimes have troubles when I sing acapella. (Like I think I'm right my others don't, or they don't say anything and I don't want to assume that the piece was good.) My family usually says I'm off-key, which is not a negative statement, but it's nice to hear that I improved from being off-key."

                "body": "This is a long post already, so I'll try to be as brief as I can. I broke it out into sections so hopefully it's easier to read. If you need any clarifying information I can provide it in the comments.\n\ntl:dr I made an evil party to challenge my PCs and I need help aligning their motivations and finding reasons that they would team up. \n\n**Preamble:**\n\nMy group of 5 players is unbelievably strong, smart, and cooperative. At level 5 they've been absolutely bodying everything I throw at them, no matter how deadly the CR, and they just hit level 6. Thank god I used the funeral early on to make them terrified of Strahd, because at this point I think they could reduce him to mist outside of his castle, albeit with a casualty or two, and I really don't want them to think they can beat Strahd in his castle at level 6, because they'll get TPK'd. I'm lucky to get one player's HP down to half in any given encounter. They took out all 3 hags, at level 5, and I was throwing as much Fire Emblem tactical bullshit out as I could muster. They just do excellent recon, they position themselves perfectly, they wait for the right moment, and they strike with coordination and efficiency.\n\nI think this is fine, but I do want to challenge them and also encourage them to try to solve more things in a less videogame-ey fashion. They play like they can just get whatever they want from NPCs with the threat of flexing their massive... abilities. The NPCs are clever and bite the PCs in their asses for trying to do this quite a bit, but a few of the party members don't quite understand that these are supposed to be real people. Our druid ran into Strahd in the street after Strahd had committed a heinous act of public dismemberment around the next corner, and the druid thought he could just ask Strahd a few questions, and receive answers, from the Vampire king, in the street, like this is Skyrim or some shit. They fear and respect mindless monsters, but not so much things that they can talk to.\n\nSo what I did was create 5 PCs to mirror and amplify PCs less savory characteristics, they ran into one last night at our session and still managed to subdue him, but boy were they shocked when they had to catch a teleportation-themed wizard (Victor) at their level. The party was noticeably more respectful of human NPCs for a while after that encounter. I want to bring all of these characters together, eventually culminating in a race for power at the Amber Temple. The rival team also opposes Strahd, but they are all evil for varying reasons. All of these rivals are redeemable in one way or another, but I do want them all together for at least one showdown before they start switching sides. I just don't know how to get them all on the same team.\n\n**My goals:**\n\nI plan on using this party (in addition to Strahd) to occasionally mix things up in parts of Barovia that the players have already visited, giving them reasons to go back. Also, I plan on using some or all of these characters to provide mini-boss fights over the artifacts from the tarot reading, and I want to ramp up a sense of urgency in the Amber Temple by making another team compete for the Dark Gifts within. I think if the rival team is formidable, Strahd would have his attention divided once the artifacts start getting uncovered, which would provide a plausible explanation for why he isn't constantly assailing the party every minute of every day once he realizes he needs to take the gloves off. Finally, I want to give my players someone their own size that they can try to pick on. Strahd is too strong, or at least my players need to believe that for a while longer. I am proud of their tactics when they fight challenging monsters, but they just don't afford intelligent creatures the same respect.\n\n**Rival Characters:**\n\n**Doru (Dhampir, Bard, College of Spirits)** \\- Was one of the only musicians in Barovia before he was turned. The party completely ignored him when they were at the church. Now he's a Bard in the College of Spirits. He escaped the undercroft and killed and ate his own father in a blind fury of hunger. He has basically lost his mind as he avoids facing this terrible thing that he has done. He uses mostly illusion magic so I can fuck with the players. He is chaotic evil and is meant to mirror the chaotic good Druid who is the classic \"I'm kind of a stoner and just along for the ride\" guy. Doru can still be saved with greater restoration or remove curse.\n\n**Winx (Fairy, Paladin, Oath of Glory)** \\- A former PC that belonged to a player who was only around in the first session. I had Strahd OHKO this character at the funeral (in self-defense) in the second session after her player moved away. Was focused on fame and glory before, now resurrected and corrupted, this character is convinced infamy will work just fine. Wants to take Strahd's place and is neutral evil. This PC and the party's ranger are the only two characters that knew each other outside of Barovia. The ranger is going through a character arc where they are learning to be more heroic and selfless, and I want to use this PC turned NPC to kind of be a foil to that arc as a selfish attention-whore. Winx is also angry that the rest of the party stood by as Strahd slaughtered her. I'll probably connect her resurrection to one of the dark powers at the Amber Temple, but as of now the party doesn't know about her being undead.\n\n**Victor Vallakovich (Human, Wizard, War Magic)** \\- Much more competent than the RAW version. He is a teenage wizard prodigy who just wants to get out of Barovia. His father shared the same goals and nurtured his magical talent. The party staged a coup in Vallaki but betrayed Fiona at the last moment. Strahd appeared and finished Fiona's attempted execution of Vargas Vallakovich because he wanted to see what the players would do about it. Victor, who was present for the execution, escaped to his study and teleported using his circle. The party found out that the text of his spellbook had been tampered with, and the circle actually sent him straight into Castle Ravenloft. There, Strahd modified his memory to make him think the party's Raven Queen warlock executed his father (the Warlock, in reality, used Form of Dread to rescue Victor and his family from being executed). He is now on a quest for vengeance, currently lawful evil. The warlock likes to get things quick and easy, so Victor is supposed to be a versatile, stifling spellcaster who works hard for his power. He resents the warlock not only for killing his father, but for receiving his abilities as a part of his pact instead of intense study. Victor can have his memories restored and he'll change to lawful good if the party can pull it off.\n\n**Ernst Larnak (Human, Rogue, Scout)** \\- You might remember him as Fiona's slimy spy, but my Ernst was less slimy and more devoted to a woman he secretly harbored feelings for. The party knows little about him. They completely abused poor Ernst in their first encounter with him due to a series of bad rolls (particularly our barbarian), and generally treated him with disdain in encounters with him later. Ernst may be a spy, but he believes in loyalty and elegance. Our barbarian is coarse and rude, and has a tendency to betray NPCs in the most direct way possible, oh yeah, and he was the one to kill Lady Wachter. Ernst hates the barbarian for all of these reasons. The party hasn't seen him since before the coup, but Ernst definitely saw everything that went down from the shadows. Right now his only motivation is revenge, which lets him jive with Victor but not Doru, and only a little bit with Winx. Ernst is also the only rival character that currently has no motivation to defeat Strahd.\n\n**Arrigal (Vistani, Rogue, Assassin)** \\- The party saw Luvash whipping that boy for losing his daughter and nicknamed him \"whip-daddy\" and then, by extension, named Arrigal \"uncle-daddy.\" Our new paladin has a huge crush on Arrigal despite him openly admitting on several occasions that he works for Strahd. They are always trying to get him to help with various missions, which he occasionally obliges if he thinks the outcome will please Strahd. Arrigal is secretly trying to gain Strahd's favor to get closer to him and find a way to replace Rahadin as Strahd's chamberlain, in an attempt to one day assassinate the devil himself. He is a proud Vistani who believes his people do not need to exist under the protection of Strahd, who, in Arrigal's opinion, holds the Vistani back. The only reason I picked Arrigal to be the mirror of the paladin is because the paladin loves \"uncle-daddy\" so much and keeps trying to romance him despite him saying he's going to betray the party and then doing just that. The party hasn't found any of the artifacts yet, so Arrigal isn't hostile to them, but he is weary that they may find great power at the Amber Temple since they spoke to Kasimir about going down there after they get a bit stronger. He figures if Strahd wanted them dead, he'd have killed them, so he avoids outright murdering the party.\n\n**What I have so far:**\n\nSo far Doru and Winx have already met. Winx was buried at the church in the village of Barovia, and she let Doru out of the undercroft. Doru is kind of willingly subordinate to Winx, who is using him as a spy to learn the whereabouts of her old friends. Strahd would have just released a mind-modified Victor out of the Castle around the time Doru and Winx were in the area heading to Vallaki from the Village of Barovia. They could meet on the road but I don't know why Victor would want to join forces with the other two. I don't know how to introduce Ernst on his own before making him a part of the group. I want the players to realize that he's going to be a major threat later, like with Victor, but I don't want to immediately throw him into the rival team. Finally, the party is familiar with Arrigal, but I currently have no idea why he would, at any point, want to actually help or join either group of adventurers instead of trying to achieve his plans alone."

I don't think I need to explain the nightmares to this sub, I did a search and it looks like it's a pretty common experience for people trying to quit.\n\nI just don't know what to do, I'm starting to lose it again and I really don't want to go back to smoking. I just don't feel like I'm sleeping at all, and they don't make medicine that stops dreams as far as I know. Every day seems so disconnected from the last. I live entire horrible lifetimes every night, several of them, and I wake up constantly. My wife said I started singing in my sleep the other day. Even when the dreams aren't bad, they're so vivid and strong that they completely fuck my sense of day-to-day continuity. \n\nI want to be done with weed, at least for this chapter of my life, but I'm actually going to lose it if I can't do something about these dreams. I'm so tired, and I've tried exercising, taking baths, reading, hell I've even been reading kid's books before bed so I have less nightmare fuel and still every night is like an episode of Black Mirror on crack in my head. Online it says I can expect another month or two of this, which I always think I can manage until I actually get into it and then I relapse just to stop the dreams. \n\nIt seems like there are some people here who made it through the nightmare gauntlet, do you have any advice for me before I completely lose my mind?"

No relevant medical conditions.\n\nI was wondering if I should continue to take this drug. I wasn't really looking for a prescription, just an opportunity to speak to a healthcare professional. I have problems with motivation and I don't feel rewarded when I accomplish, well, anything really. I thought maybe I had some mild ADHD or something but I tried adderall in college and it made me super high and anxious so my doc took me off of it. I bounced back so well from the adderall that we decided to just not do anything. I tried cocaine for the first time after college and it's always made me very relaxed and amped at the same time, but I know not to abuse coke and I didn't want to get addicted, so I just had it at a few parties. Now this wellbutrin stuff makes me feel exactly the same way as cocaine did. I do feel more productive and less apathetic, but I also feel that amped/relaxed feeling and it seems like my body is tense, I have to try not to clench my jaw or keep my shoulders shrugged, and I feel noticeably high. Not like \"oh this will start to take effect in a few weeks\" like the label or the website says. Within 10 minutes of taking the pill I feel like I just did a line of coke. \n\nPlease let me know if this is normal and I should stick it out or if this is not normal and I should stop taking this medicine."

In fact, people unnecessarily shy away from confronting those topics.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch, though.\n\nYou should have learned something and fully recovered from it.\n\nLet\u2019s use anxiety as an example. It\u2019s not a great idea to write an essay about anxiety if you\u2019re still vulnerable. You\u2019re desperately opening up still-healing wounds just to catch the attention of some random admissions officer out there, some admissions officer who would have equally appreciated a less sensitive topic. \n\nIn addition to that, you still have so many negative feelings about anxiety, feelings that are being poured into your essay. All that\u2019s going to happen is that you\u2019re left with an essay that only conveys your instability and room for improvement. It\u2019s not a bad thing, of course, but essays are meant to show the best side of you. Your responsibility. Your maturity. Your empathy. \n\nMental health issues suck and are so so SO stigmatized, but it\u2019s in your best interest to leave it out of your essay if you\u2019re still working towards better health. Your mental health is something that is only revealed to your near and dear ones, and you\u2019re not obliged to spill your darkest secrets to an admissions officer that you don\u2019t know.\n\nIf it\u2019s a past issue, though, then feel free to write about it. You\u2019re not opening wounds, you\u2019re showing scars. And at the end of the day, being able to pull yourself out of such a dark place is definitely something that brings across a lot of maturity and strength.\n\nSo definitely choose wisely if you\u2019re planning on going down that essay route :)\n\n\n**Just as a reminder, this isn\u2019t my viewpoint, just a pretty interesting one I recently heard.

Their damage is pitifully low and they turn embarrassingly slow meaning they are totally impractical to defend anything on their own or even provide support fire because of how negligible they are outside of playing a little noise when they see an enemy.\n\nEither avoidance needs to be changed so that it only warns you of threats / gives you a slight delay to react before they lock on or explode, or spitfire turrets need to be buffed so they act as a real threat to run avoidance for, their health and reaction time is fine but they definitely need to either deal more damage or just move faster / more accurately.\n\n*and while im here, remove assault rifles from medic and give them to HA, give carbines to medic :)*"

So here goes.:\n\nI main NC on connery, incidentally I am an engie/medic main for the support. It should also be noted that in my time using the masthead on participating in large fights, we never got trashtalked for using the masthead, and 99% of the ACTUAL complaints in the game have been about the other AMRs needing a buff. Sometimes I forget how much redditors like to cry their eyes out and point fingers at others at moments notice.\n\nafter playing with it for a few hours, the masthead really isnt bad (so much for that one guy earlier saying it would \"ruin\" the game!) the masthead is really fun and a nice Anti-Air option for the NC, but is slow as all hell and gets punished pretty hard at medium range because of the spread and scope, and isnt as good against units that arent ESF. The TR and VS AMR should definitely be buffed somehow. \n\nI heard about making the TR AMR a semi-auto and buffing its OHK range and possibly reducing its default scope, all great ideas since it seems to underpreform pretty hard to even the archer. Given its described purpose, it'd also be a good idea to buff its damage against grounded armor as well, possibly with a feature similar to the flak rounds which would make it good against lighter armor.\n\nThe VS AMR needs to lose the firing delay certainly needs to be dropped or removed, I heard someone else recommend making the projectile a \"blade\" shape so it can hit in a wide spread(?) which might make it an excellent option for wiping through hallways and tightly packed pushes. Increasing its projectile velocity is a good idea too.\n\nOverall I see what the devs wanted with these weapons. NC is meant to be anti-air, VS is anti-infantry, TR is anti-armor. The other two factions simply need buffs to better realize that role so they can stop crying when the other faction gets something nice to play with.\n\nOn a side note, the NSO AMR is fantastic for its role, its clearly meant as purely anti-max since it disables repairs (from what ive seen, not 110% sure) from them, keeps them out of the frontline longer and makes engie pockets piss themselves.\n\nI look forward to shitting on more A2G ESF in the future, good luck to the other factions!"

Unless you're a narcissist, living with someone, depending on them, doing everything they don't traditionally have to because they're the one earning and not even being in love is one of the reasons that the traditional gender roles broke. The person providing has more freedom and more power in the dynamic and that comes with a lot of other things. I have friends, most friends that married a guy and put their own careers on hold and moved and they were all tech graduates and I think only few are content with it, some have no self-esteem, others are miserable with the dynamic and others just envy the free lol.

It happened as soon as I was about to sleep (I've read the crap about sleep terrors and all, doesn't apply) so finally I just gave up on believing any kind of mumbo jumbo and had to focus very hard on just the concrete.

I am more of an introverted independent researcher kind. I want to go to grad school because I think there's a lot more to learn yet. I generated my ideas myself, took several MOOCS and have done extensive literature review in my area of interest which I'm well aware everyone does but yet have no publications. My first paper was rejected by a top conference this year and I'm working on my next paper and plan on submitting it to another top conference. I also have never really considered research or Robotics before my Masters, never read a paper in my entire life. But after starting my masters I'm not only totally into it, I also feel this is what I really need to do. I can see there are excellent candidates I have to compete against to just get in and I feel I stand nowhere.\n\nWhat could I highlight in my SOP. What range would you say my target schools should be. Top 15, 20, 25, 30?\n\nI'd really appreciate some feedback!"

Their website is down and their last twitter post was last year but fuck it, nows the perfect time to make easy money.\n\nSatopays market cap is around 100 dollars. To put things into perspective, Bitcoin sits at around 380 billion dollars. This market cap is one of the lowest out there and due to being abandoned it is scam proof.\n\nIf you put 50 dollars into this coin right now and if it reached its peak market cap of 920k, you'd have 460k. Talk about some free real estate.\n\nI ought to bribe yters to advertise this coin and send it to the fucking moon"

Everyone else averted their eyes immediately. I couldn't understand why. Apparently it was horrifying and very bloody. The pedant in me was trying very hard not to ask how they knew this when they weren't watching it. Then they asked me why I was able to watch it unphased. I said \"Well, been there, done that.\""

Thank you all for the forever promises. Thank you all for giving me a reason to feel again. An even greater thank you for slowly tearing it apart with childish bullshit. \n\nTo the loud one. You were always blunt and honest. I respected that. You said what you wanted to unashamedly and let your feelings be known when they needed to be. In the end. You allowed yourself to be silent. You allowed yourself to get so swept up in emotion that you couldn\u2019t speak your mind, wether out of fear or out frustration. Thanks for letting me down as the voice, the start of a conversation, the mediator to the solution. \n\nTo the parent. In the beginning you were tough and intimidating. You joked, you laughed, & you loved. You called it like you saw it and looked out for all of us. In the end, after all of the work we put in to get past your guard, you allowed yourself to be swayed and lose sight of your conviction. You let your guard come back. You allowed us to grow distant. Thanks for letting me down as the quality control and caregiver. \n\nTo the lost. You once said you knew your place in our group dynamic. You didn\u2019t know it but I truly began to pay more attention to you after that. You provided the noise in the dark quiet. The stories to distract us from the elephant in the room. The reminder that we each brought something to this group and everyone had value. The importance of finding your tribe. Thanks for never giving up. You haven\u2019t let me down. In the end I can\u2019t blame you fir losing the will to owed through the same cycle if bullshit we found ourselves in. I hope you find better. Truly you deserve it. \n\nTo the flirt. I came to this group because of you. You were the center to all of it. The reason we found each other. You challenged us, you joked with us, you offered perspective to all of our problems. You brought a light that allowed us to grow with each other. I loved you. Truly if there was a way, I\u2019d spend the rest of my life with you. We became so close, too close it seems. You started to shut me out. You changed and when I tried to be there like a friend you wouldn\u2019t let me. I became a chore. I wish I could go back to the time before you were hurt so I could stop it from happening. Thanks for letting that light be snuffed out. Thanks for showing me that words spoken mean nothing given the actions taken. Thanks for showing me that we actually mean nothing to you. We are a distraction for your mind, a group that needed you in the beginning until we grew to match you. You decided you weren\u2019t important and let your actions do the rest. You stopped caring and it showed. \n\nTo the group entirely. Thanks for showing me that I once again chose to invest in people that couldn\u2019t be open and honest when push came to shove. Thanks for allowing me to invest in a group that won\u2019t fight for the memories and milestones. Thank you all for making me feel like I found my home, then burning it to the ground. \n\nI write this here believing that our time is coming to a close. There may be a glimmer of hope, but I don\u2019t know that it will stand. I wanted this to be forever. I thought we had it figured out. I guess I was wrong."

White, currently I am on no medications. \n\nI have been dealing with abdominal pain since I was in about 6th or 7th grade (age 12/13) that is accompanied by what seems like constant nasal drainage and fluid in my ears along with constipation, bloating, and half the time the stool is either really hard or really runny (like can change within the day). I get dizzy a lot now too and that has only been happening for about the last year and isn't involved with standing up or moving too fast.\n\nFor the abdominal pain, my pediatrician originally thought it was GERD and put me on omeprazole (I was on it for 3 years). When I saw my GI, she switched me to famotidine, miralax every day, and vitamin d. Within the span of 2020, I have gotten an endoscopy and colonoscopy which both came back normal, blood panel that also came back within normal range, and stool sample. Everything came back within a healthy range for my age. I stopped taking anything for it aside from papaya enzymes for reflux like a month or 2 ago. (I was told to stop taking tums because of the amount of calcium deposits in my nails and teeth, those have been happening for as long as I can remember so I don't think anything I was taking caused the deposits to happen)\n\nOne of the people that did the scoping then suggested it could be endo related. That leaves me to where I am now. I just got my ultrasound results and they said everything looked normal, I have a pap smear in a little less than a week from now. They had me stop taking birth control (isabloom if that matters) incase that was causing anything (I got put on it for acne)\n\nFor the nasal drainage, the only thing they could think of was allergies and told me to take allergy medicine for it, I can't remember the name of it but it was a circular red pill (nasal decongestant). I gave up on fighting that battle because it didn't work and they tell me it's allergies. For the weird ear fluid thing, I just get some variation of \"that sucks\" and no problem shooting/solving. The nasal drainage and fluid in ear is a big reason why I don't think it is allergy related.\n\nI have gotten very frustrated with everything continually coming back \"fine\", because of the amount of pain I'm in, I don't eat as often as I should and it has been messing with my sleep. I'm starting to feel like I'm hallucinating all of this or something because of the results. There have been times where it has been so painful to move from my bed without my mom's assistance because of the pain (probably just really bad gas). \n\nPlease shed some light on what might be wrong, or further ways to go about this if you can. I just want to figure out what is going on before I get out of highschool but my age is making things a lot more difficult since doctors I've seen think I'm too young for this to be happening."

Amazon doesn't have any good FMA merch so it was exciting to see that. I definitely think more variety would help your store. More popular anime like Hunter x Hunter, Parasyte, Samurai Champloo, Made In Abyss, Jujustsu Kaisen, and the others you referenced (Black Clover, AoT, Naruto). \n\nAlso having hats, beanies, and hoodies is great, but I feel like shirts are more universal and often cheaper for the consumer.

                "body": "So I usually stick to action/adventure type anime, but I saw online that the MC of OreGairu was an INTP personality type, which is also what I am. So I decided to give it a shot and I'm so glad I did because I really like the show! I just finished season 2 (and I'm glad season 3 is starting soon!) and I wanted to share some thoughts.\n\n* I relate to **Hikigaya** A LOT on certain things \u2013 his being a loner, his dismissal of social expectations & superficiality, his apathy for many things in life, especially the societal emphases/pressures, and his reluctance to fully engage in relationships because they're either shallow and/or never last. (Also IMO all these things highly correlate to the INTP type.)\n   * However, the one thing that I couldn't relate to was Hikigaya's constant pessimism. It's so grating! I've had friends that not only think like that, but talk like that too and it's such a downer. I couldn't stand being around it. I understand Hikigaya's stark realism because I think much the same, but his cynicism was just straight off-putting. It gets a little better as it goes on, but it still bugged me.\n* I love **Yui's** desire for something beyond the superficial drama & friends, her optimism & bubliness, and her dedication to keep the group together and going strong. Her extroversion and child-like enthusiasm are so crucial to the group dynamic. The only thing I'm scared about is her getting burned in the end. I guess I'll have to wait and see what happens...\n* I'm gonna be honest about **Yukino**, at first I wasn't drawn to her, but as time went on I realized that was the point. She isn't the bubbly girl like Yui, the popular girl like Iroha, or the hot, bitchy girl like Miura. She was the calm, logical, and mysterious girl. She slowly became more and more fascinating as time went on. By the 2nd season I was yelling at my screen for Hikigaya to make a move already haha\n* **Ms. Hiratsuka** is one character that doesn't make a ton of sense to me. She drives students in her car, she physically punishes students, she smokes next to students, etc. I'm not sure how that works in real life haha (I'm sure some of it can be chalked up to just fan service.) However, she does have a good heart and a sound mind that helps guide a lot of the students to come together. She definitely deserves an award for that.\n* Lastly, I think **Saki** got overlooked as a character. When she was first introduced I thought she was gonna have a much bigger role going forward and I was disappointed when she didn't. She was the girl I was drawn to originally, but unfortunately nothing happened with her. It's a shame lol\n\nWell thanks for reading my rant. I'd love to hear you thoughts and impressions. Let me know!"

He states multiple theories concerning this. (Trading off of the power to kill, etc.) So then why involve Light at all? If L was true to his character (hell even just to be safe) he would've detained Light during the whole chase, arrest, processing, and interrogation of Higuchi.\n\nAnd if that would have happened, then Light would have never touched the Death Note and regained his memories of it.

                "created_utc": 1599403978.0,
                "body": "A lot of people on this sub are asking about how they can say funny things and be a good storyteller. How they can be a good talker. What we have to realise is that being a good listener is even more important. Imo **listening is the 1 most accessible way of improving social skills**. Talking and being listened to releases feel-good hormones and makes people associate feeling good with being friends with you. What's great about listening is that even though innate social skills help, listening skills can be 90% improved with effort. (I made up that statistic, but you get the point). If and when this improves you can focus on other forms of social skills because listening -> more people like you -> more situations to practice social skills. \n\nThere are different types of good listeners and personality often affects which types comes more naturally. One type isn't better than another, but some types are better for certain situations. So it's good to focus on enhancing the types that come naturally for you.\n\n## Understanding, empathetic listener\n You can be the understanding and empathetic type, the \"therapist\". Its super important to learn this for bonding and intimacy. There's a risk of being used as  a therapist and attracting people who like to complain (though if you like complaining as well it doesn't have to be bad). Make sure your friends give something back as well. You can be the listening or you can be the advice type of friend. Ask the person or try figuring out **if they want advice or if they just want to vent** so you don't give unsolicited advice. It can be annoying if you give advice and they don't follow it, but if the advice was unsolicited that's on you.\n\nIf they dont want advice but just need to vent, also try to figure out **if they want positive enforcement or if they want validation for their problems**. A general rule I think is if they're complaining about actual problems they probably want validation, but if they're really stressed and anxious about something they don't have to be about they probably want positive enforcement.\n\nWhat I mean is if someone says \"I'm so stressed for this date I don't know how to talk to people I like and my face is breaking out!\" then you should be like \"It'll go fine, you're such an interesting people and your skin is fine!\". (Don't lie though, if they're having a breakout you can say \"you're so pretty /have pretty eyes/... anyway he won't think about some pimples\"). On the other hand, if they're like \"oh I'm always failing my exams because I blank out when I'm stressed\" you should be like \"oof that's rough buddy\"(jk aita reference but something similar). Because if you say \"I'm sure you'll do fine\" when their experiences are that it does not go fine you're just trivializing their problems.\n\n##Encouraging listener\nThis one is really great for a lot of people here, because if you know what it's like to be uncomfortable speaking in groups you can easily relate to others who feel the same! Try to notice those who get spoken over or who are trying to tell a story but are stumbling. Encourage them, listen and make them more confident! \n\nOpen body language and facial expressions are important for this. Stand turned towards them, look at them (I think it's like 70% eye contact or something) and show with your face that you're reacting to what they're saying.\n\nIf someone is spoken over you can make a mental note, and first listen to the interrupter and answer them, and when theyre done you can say \"You had something you were trying to say, what was it?\" This will make people really like you because they feel noticed and that makes them feel good. If the interrupter is very rude you can also say \"im sorry X, but Y is trying to say something / was talking first\". Though this can lead to a bit of drama, but it can show person Y you're standing up for them. Most people don't interrupt on purpose and will realise they interrupted and feel bad about it if you do the first one. If they're a good person but have a habit of interrupting you can talk to interrupter about it outside of group setting and help them by agreeing to a sign to tell them when they're interrupting without embarrassing them in front of a group since this can lead to them being defensive or too guilt ridden to speak at all.\n\n## Enthusiastic listening (and interrupting)\nThis one is like an exaggerated version of the last one but I'm splitting them into two paragraphs for easy reading. If the encouraging type is an active listener, this type is, well, enthusiastic. There are some charisma videos on will smith that explain the enthusiasm part better than me, so I will talk more about good and bad interrupting.\n\nTip for interrupting: This is great if you're like me with Adhd and have a bad habit if interrupting and getting new ideas. **Interrupting isn't *always* bad, but you have to do it right**. You can be really encouraging with comments and reaction or you can go off on the speakers ideas. For example if someone is saying something about a fact and talking you can agree with \"yeah, and that works in this topic as well!\" and then shut up and show attentive body language to signal that the person should continue talking. (Bad example, hope you understand).\n\nThis can show that you're listening and very interested in what they're saying. **Its important not to go off on a tangent while you're interrupting**, and if you do, cut it short, apologize and ask them to continue. Big note is that not everyone likes this and some people can get annoyed if you finish their sentences. So if you notice they get annoyed like rolling their eyes, saying stuff like \"anyway, what I was saying\" or they lose flow of what they were saying, don't do this with them. \n\nAnd also important is that this is great for showing you agree with them on an opinion, **but don't do it with disagreeing**. If you disagree it's REALLY important to note what they're saying and  think it through. You can show it with facial expressions and weighing your words / waiting a few seconds before you speak to show that you're not immediately disagreeing with everything they have to say. Showing that youre open to their opinions will also make them respect you more and be more open to your opinions.\n\nThere's this game we had in drama class translated to \"Yeah, lets do that!\" about learning to being positive and playing off on other's ideas. Person 1 came up with an idea for something to do, and Person 2 had to say \"Yeah, lets do that! And after that we can do this [suggestion]!\" and it went back and forth. It was about always being positive during brainstorming ideas, but I think it holds a lot of value in real life as well.\n\n##The funny, joke-making listener\nYou can be the fun type that can turn a conversation into jokes. Jokes usually are a lot more funny if they're related to the conversation, so bad jokes and puns work great even if they're not funny on their own. These jokes are *situational* and is great for those who have a quick wit.Try to know your audience. If you're using a lot of sarcasm, not everyone will get it. Dark humor makes you the funniest person in some people's eyes, but in others you're an evil person who says offensive stuff. Read the room or test the waters with some milder jokes. If you come up with a joke you're unsure is okay you can make that facial expression that you thought of something funny. If they're curious and ask you can say \"I just thought of a joke but it's a quite dark/offensive\" and try to read the response of that. For example if they say \"I love dark humor\" it's fine, and if they say \"bring it\" but still react badly you can easily apologize and not come off as that you actually believe those things.\n\n## The listener who remembers\nIf you're not that expressive when listening you can still be a great listener! Surprising people with details you remembered can make people feel good and realise you're a good listener after all. You don't have to remember everything people say, but you should try to remember things they feel are important. If they're all about people, remembering their family is good. Same goes for if they care a lot about feelings, politics, life events etc. Especially if you have an interest in common it's important to remember the basics, for example I remember all my friends mbti type or if you're both into football you should remember their player position or favourite team.\n\nOne way you can show you're a good listener is by asking about it later. If they say they're going for a job interview, ask them how it went afterwards or ask them before it if they're nervous. \n\nAnother is if the topic is mentioned and they're telling something that you comment \"Oh, yeah because you <...>\". This is kinda like the interrupting with enthusiastic listening, but more filling in details they've told you than coming up with new ideas. For example, if they say \"Okay I know this is kinda mean but I actually feel relieved that mr.professor is sick and we got a substitute\" and you can say \"oh, yeah because Mr.professor was rude to you. Hey, don't feel guilty it's okay to be relieved for yourself even if it's a bad situation for them.\" This is also a socially acceptable way to get to the point if someone has a habit of forgetting they've already told you something and you're too impatient to hear it over and over. Make sure you don't show annoyance in your voice and remember sometimes it's best to just let them tell the story again if they just like telling stories. (Because they'll get feel-good hormones from it.)\n\nFor me, personally, I have to work a lot on this listening type. Im a super enthusiastic listener but i have trouble remembering details due to adhd. Not remembering is a pitfall that can make people dissappointed you forgot something and even make the enthusiasm seem fake. Examples are forgetting peoples birthdays, important events in their lives, what field they're studying, what their hobbies and interests are or reading their personality majorly wrong. These are things that can make someone evaluate how well you really know them.\n\nNote that it's better to remember details they said to you or in a group convo you participated in. Remembering eavesdropping can be creepy, so sometimes its better to play unknowing. Though if it's relevant you can say \"I'm sorry but I eavesdropped that you said this and that when you walked by\". Better to be upfront than defensive.\n\n\n#Asking follow up questions\nSome aspects of listening and conversations is asking follow-up questions. This can be a little tricky honestly as this takes some innate social skills. Some people will try to hint that you should ask a follow-up questions and it can be hard to get that hint.\n\nWhat helps me is by trying to be curious about what they're saying. I can ask an interesting question that shows that I *genuinely* want to know. If someone reveals a detail about themselves, like say they have trouble hearing, ask them \"whats that like/ does it affect your life a lot?\". You may learn a lot about them by something you assumed was just a detail. Maybe their hearing makes them have huge troubles in group conversations or on social events like being at a bar for example. \n\nAnother tip is try relating to what they're telling you. For example if they're talking about something they're doing and you do that as well, ask them about it. Say they're saying \"The guy im dating is ghosting me. I hate when people do that\". If you've experienced that as well and it makes you feel disrespected for example you can say \"oh I'm sorry. Does it make you feel disrespected?\" and maybe they'll answer \"yeah, a bit and it bothers me a lot because I just question myself and wonder what I did wrong. I just wish they'd have the guts to tell me why so it didn't have to drag on\". And this is also when you can turn it into a conversation on society where you can say \"oh I agree it's a big problem in society nowadays. People don't have the guts to say anything upfront. Before it was rude to end a relationship over the phone or texts, but nowadays that's good only because the worse alternative is ghosting people!\" \n\nThere are some \"go-to\" follow up questions you can use if you have trouble coming up with them. For example like \"and how does that make you feel?\", \"So what happened then?\". If you're good at being a remembering listener you can connect something someone said with something they said earlier. Ask \"Oh, like the time when x happened/ you talked about y?\". You can also try repeating what they said as a question as a way to ask for clarification.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask yes-or-no questions. There is a myth that you should only ask open-ended questions, but theres nothing with yes-or-no questions. If they answer yes or no and dont ellaborate you can ask \"how/why is that?\", \"what do you think of that?\" etc. If most of their answers are really short and they seem annoyed they may just not be in the mood for talking, and then a yes or no question is a good way to end the conversation. If you sense that and want to end the convo you can answer with \"oh, i see / understand\" or \"thanks for answering\" or something to that extent.\n\nSo asking follow up questions is a great way to alternate listening to people while also leading the conversation into topics you want to talk or hear more about. This is more or an innate social skill though that comes with trial and failure, and you can't really force yourself to come up with a question right on the spot. So I advice you to focus your energy on listening skills.\n \n#Conclusion\nThese tips are things Ive learned on my road to being better socially and a better friend. Some of these, like understanding, encouraging and remembering are things everyone should learn a little about. Still, find the listening style or styles that suits you the best. I know it's clich\u00e9, but seriously, be yourself (and the best version of yourself). You don't HAVE to be funny or give good advice or be a super expressive person.  I've honestly learnt than when I started being myself unapologetically and standing up for what I believe in I attracted great friends that love me, even though I've gained some people who dislike me along the way. \n\nThis originally was a comment on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/im7jfz/its_ok_if_you_dont_feel_like_youre_charismatic_or/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), but I think it might reach and help people on this sub if it's it's own post.\n\nThese listening advices are from someone with severe Adhd and HF autism and I've had to learn social skills the manual way. I think a lot of this is correct, but keep in mind that I don't actually know for sure so feel free to comment if you disagree or agree on some points, or have more points to add. I also appreciate if you just want to share what type you are or what you want to work on as I think it can be good to write down or say your reflections out loud to gain self-insight, at least I am that way. :)"

I thought of like those people critizising [tiktok videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/idaslf/tik_tok_girl_pretends_to_have_autism_for_a_video/) of people stimming or something and when i see the videos I think \"but i think i do that sometimes though?\". I dont think id be able to catch it on camera like they do in those videos because it happens very randomly to me (and maybe theyre faking it on camera to show what they experience off camera), but i dont think we should judge and say \"autistic people dont experience that\" just because some autistic people dont experience it\n\nLike its a huge spectrum and we're all different and we'll also react differently to different things. I think it happens to other people with autism as well because i remember when i was diagnosed my mom bought a book about autism callled \"why am i jumping\" and i was really angry bc i didnt know i was jumping lol!. i dont really react to music and i get happiness bursts really randomly. And i tried to mask it before because i had toxic friends who said that too much positivity is annoying\n\nBut now im able to be myself more and i know that my family has always appreciated it about me, good friends and also my boyfriend. Like ill just suddenly get really happy and i have to jump and shake a little and just run to my boyfriend and kiss him. He finds it endearing and supports me being myself (he doesnt idealise me btw ive experienced that in relationships before and he doesnt do that).  Anyway i just i dont think sharing that happiness is a bad thing and like yes im more sensitive and ill cry more often, and i think why not also share that happiness as well if it makes both me happier and the people around me happier?\n\nAnyway these were just some thoughts, please share what you think. Do you stim like this and do you think its problematic that people show it on tiktok, and what do you think of people saying autistic people dont do that?"

I was diagnosed with autism, adhd and OCD (mostly because of cleanliness but i have trouble with compulsive thoughts for other things as well) at 13. I have been following the [dermatillomania subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dermatillomania) for compulsive skin picking but tips like covering mirror etc has never worked a lot. THe skin picking is also worse when im on adhd medication or in stressful periods, and i usually do it at a desk or in bed or something. \n\nI saw a comment here the other day about someone mentioning they have skin picking as a stim and im relatively new to taking part of the autistic community online and wasnt really self aware but im wondering if it might be a stim and maybe thats why i often do it without even thinking about it and maybe thats why ive never been able to stop.\n\nSo if this is a stim i have, is it possible to redirect it? I know treatment for autism is  looked down upon but its really affecting my self confidence when my face is all red from acne scars. So do any of you have the same issue and do you have any tips that might work better for us with autism compared to neurotypicals with compuslive skin picking?"

Acontece que tive uma colega que precisou de algu\u00e9m que lhe fizesse uma pequena tradu\u00e7\u00e3o (60\u20ac), e eu como estou nesse grupo falei com uma tradutora com quem j\u00e1 tinha falado antes, vamos trat\u00e1-la por G. Publiquei no tal grupo as condi\u00e7\u00f5es: n\u00ba de palavras, valor, etc, e a G candidatou-se. Eu falei com ela atrav\u00e9s da minha conta pessoal e encaminhei o email da minha tal colega. \n\nPelos vistos a minha colega (agora ex colega, ela saiu da empresa h\u00e1 cerca de 2 meses) ainda n\u00e3o lhe pagou, ent\u00e3o a G veio falar comigo a perguntar informa\u00e7\u00f5es. Eu disse a verdade, que apenas fui intermedi\u00e1ria e que n\u00e3o estou relacionada com esse trabalho. Ela ao in\u00edcio aceitou mas ao ver o tempo passar foi-me mandando mensagens todos os dias, mesmo eu j\u00e1 tendo explicado tudo e tendo dado os contactos da minha colega, que pelos vistos n\u00e3o lhe tem respondido. Ora, sempre que abro o facebook tenho l\u00e1 uma nova mensagem dela. \"N\u00e3o lhe fazia mal nenhum responder-me\", \"deve saber mais coisas sobre o projeto\", etc. Por um lado eu percebo a frustra\u00e7\u00e3o da G, mas por outro o meu papel de intermedi\u00e1ria literalmente acabou. \n\nJ\u00e1 relatei a situa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 minha colega porque isto \u00e9 muito chato para mim, a minha colega diz para eu ignorar porque ela tratar\u00e1 em breve e que est\u00e1 a passar por uma situa\u00e7\u00e3o dif\u00edcil. O pagamento j\u00e1 est\u00e1 atrasado h\u00e1 2 semanas, creio eu.\n\nJ\u00e1 me aconselharam a bloquear a G mas n\u00e3o sei se ser\u00e1 o melhor caminho.

It didn't end up helping with either of those, but after about a month it worsened my fatigue to the point where I was sleeping about 14 hours a day (rather than 10 - 12). My psychiatrist believed it hadn't started working yet, and doubled the dose to 300mg for the next month. This resulted in my sleeping for 16 - 18 hours a day, and at this point it became very obvious it was worsening my POTS symptoms and I went off the medication. I'd suspected it after the first month, though. Other POTS symptoms such as general weakness and headaches from standing were also amplified, though considerably less so than the fatigue. I don't remember many specifics though because this was a year ago.\n\nI'm posting about this now because to this day, I have found no other recorded cases of majorly increased fatigue as a side effect of Wellbutrin. I have no idea what happened, but it didn't affect my depression or ADHD in the slightest \u2014 I just got really, really tired, even more so than usual, and it became hard for me to stay awake for more than 6 hours a day. The only things I can find about Wellbutrin XL causing fatigue are from overdoses, and taking lowest prescribable dose (150mg) seems very unlikely to cause that.\n\nWondering if anyone else has experienced this type of reaction to Wellbutrin."

I've always had issues with the way people treat me differently because I (appear to be a) woman and it's something I've complained about to my mother on multiple occasions. A year or two ago, I was once again complaining about how people don't take me seriously because I'm a girl (didn't realize I was trans at the time) and my mom kind of exploded at me and said I was too masculine, I was too aggressive/assertive/take-charge-and-get-shit-done dominant for a girl and people didn't know what to do with me so they completely disregarded everything I had to say. It kinda stuck in my brain and I was really hurt by it for a while... because why should whether I act feminine or masculine affect how people treat me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that was really when I first started questioning my gender. I was upset about it for weeks. I didn't like being disregarded or treated differently because I was a girl with strong opinions, I don't take shit from people, I have interests in and subsequently knowledge about multiple STEM fields that the average girl my age does not have. None of those really have much to do with gender, but in traditional gender roles those don't line up with me being AFAB and people sometimes view me differently for it. Hell, I'm getting college mail from Yale and Stanford right now because I'm a girl who got a 4 on the AP Computer Science exam and there's way less female engineers than male. But I don't want to be treated any differently than I would be if I were born male, and the fact is I *am* being treated differently because I was born a girl. If I came out, would colleges lose interest? (At least some of the religious ones would stop sending me mail, which I see as an upside.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor years, I didn't recognize that my desire to have a lower voice and wishing I had male genitalia rather than female is textbook dysphoria. It's kind of silly that it took me this long to figure it out. It was only when I looked up FTM sex change surgeries and realized I was jealous of the people who get bottom surgery that I was like, okay, I am definitely not cisgender. I'm dead scared of coming out to people because no one in my family knows how to keep their mouth shut and I live in a moderately conservative area. It's been less than a month since there were people protesting the inclusion of the phrase \"gender identity\" in an antidiscrimination clause for our school system's policy without even bringing up bathrooms. Also, what even with bathrooms? And I still can't view myself as male even though I want to be male? It's just really weird.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGotta say, coming out as pansexual barely qualified as coming out for me, I literally mentioned it in passing to a few people and even though my dad reacted negatively, it didn't really matter because it's not like he can stop me from dating someone of the same gender.. This is a whole new level of *oh shit do i tell them or no* for me. Do I ask to see a gender therapist or just wait out the year and a half til I'm 18? It's just weird having to think about this and kinda scary."

I think they can fall in love, get depressed etc just like humans.\n\nAnd i don't believe they instinctively hate humans. Rather this is probably a result of their \"upbringing\" in devil \"society\" and devil culture. They must be taught to believe this or come to this conclusion because of their (justified?) oppression. And treatment like this explains the vast majority being quirky(mentally unstable) and having \"inhuman\" behaviour.\n\nThe darkness devil is a very different case because he been living for 100s of thousands for years who knows what happens to a mind like that. Call me out if i'm spewing bs and i need to make a contract with the reading comprehension devil."

I've so far experimented with many pens but i find that rollerball pens are expensive, bulky and their ink runs out quickly whereas ball point pens are the complete opposite and i find the ink doesn't flow enough, leaving my writing faded and incomplete. \n\nso far the best pens i have found is either the muji 0.5 pen (however they run out of ink faster than i can order them on amazon) and the uni ball jetstream 101 1.0 \n\ni would really appreciate your recommendations"

But I get it as soon as I wake up and afterwards it disappears and I will never remember what the tune was, very recently I actually heard lyrics for the first time and ithe sound of it was definitely not of the alternative genre, I wrote down the lyrics as soon as I could so I could remember, it was just a single line, \"oo ee I'm not the worst enemy\" lol I know weird.. but I want to know what this is and why it happens, I can't say it's musical hallucinations because it's not external, it's just there in my head, a bit like the feeling when you get a song stuck in your head (kinda).

I just know that, when he inevitably dies, I'm really not going to be able to handle it at all.\n\nI've grown up with him. My earliest memories have him in them, and he's been with my family through everything. One time my dad left the stove on before we all went to bed, and before the house could burn down, my cat woke us all up, meowing and scratching at all of our doors until we figured out what was happening. He's been there for my worst days and he's been there for my best days, and he's shockingly well-behaved despite many cat-related stereotypes you may see.\n\nI can very firmly state that despite having five other pets, all dogs, and having grown up with many more dogs, I am a cat person.\n\nCats usually live to about 13-17 years if they're indoor pets, which mine is. So I've got roughly three years minimum left with him. Summer's approaching and classes are going to pick up after that, and I have friends who like going out, so I'll be spending less and less time at home with him.\n\nI don't know. I love him a lot, and I'm really, really going to miss him. He's sleeping at the foot of my bed as I write this.\n\nI'm scared of how I will react after he dies. It's like flipping a coin, 50/50 chance of either-or. Heads, I never stop crying, or tails, I shut the fuck down and have an eventual outburst.\n\nMy family definitely won't have as dramatic reactions. They're dog people, after all, and they don't spend nearly as much time with this cat as I do. He comes to my room every night, and he's probably the only living being I typically allow in my room for over five minutes. He'll spend nights sleeping, and in the morning we'll both get up and go out for food. It's just our little routine, we've always done it, and eventually when I wake up in the morning he won't fucking be there. And the rest of my family will likely hardly notice, because he's a quiet cat.\n\nI don't want to spend time mourning him when he's not even dead yet."

I\u2019m a new DM, this was my first time DMing and I (14X) did it with some irls from my classes, it was also most of their first times playing. The player that I\u2019m particularly talking about\u2014 who I\u2019ll call Player\u2014 is someone I\u2019ve had conflict with in the past due to some shitty things they did, but they wanted to play so I said sure.\n\nSession start, they individually make their way to the tavern, other players roleplay. There\u2019s a jukebox.\n\nPlayer enters and orders their food, and, out of character, looks me, the DM, dead in the eyes, and says, \u201cI\u2019m gonna make this as hard on you as possible.\u201d\n\nThey proceed to make their way to the jukebox, get into a fight with an orc, roll a nat 20 on their intimidation check and intimidate him so much he faints on the spot, they fight his friends and win. They say they want the jukebox to play Never Gonna Give You Up, I allow it before saying the jukebox sounds funny like the wiring got fucked up from the fight, they shake the jukebox until it breaks, and then they just. Leave the tavern. They don\u2019t stay to get their food, they just flat out tell me they\u2019re leaving the tavern.\n\nI\u2019ve got an event planned to happen in this tavern that I kind of need all the players there for, so I\u2019m struggling to do damage control and I don\u2019t want to just.. not let them leave. So I move the event up. At this point I\u2019m mildly pissed off.\n\nAs Player\u2019s about to leave, a halfling bursts in and collapses. Player kind of mellows out after this, thankfully? They help out, other players do to, they find out they need to evacuate and the session goes smoothly besides that one bump.\n\nAll the players tell me they had fun, but later Player messages me and explains that they don\u2019t want to play anymore. At this point, I\u2019m very okay with this.\n\nI feel like I was an asshole considering the way I handled it, pretty sure I could\u2019ve done better and been a bit kinder. I might be getting pissy over this, it\u2019s not that big of a deal.\n\nEdit: I went over the character limit and edited a bunch out, accidentally cut the part where we argued so I\u2019ll put that here now.\nBasically, a bunch of old memories from prior to quarantine were brought up in an argument over text. I didn\u2019t used to be a great person either, I was mildly obsessive and a major people pleaser who said too much and fucked some people up that way, Player including. Player, on the other hand, was fairly creepy in the way that they sent myself and like five other people notes saying they loved us, and they were the kind of person that flexed their own trauma.\nI\u2019ve now blocked them on all platforms and although they\u2019ve tried to message me apologizing, I haven\u2019t once replied. I\u2019ve avoided them to the best of my abilities in all classes."

There are things that Krita doesn't have compared with CSP, to name some: 3D models, convert brightness to opacity, and one click away to activate stroke lines (this tool is a bit hidden in Krita and it is annoying for me). \n\nSo far, I've used Krita mostly because CSP in Windows 10 virtual machine in my pc broke all the time and I could not stand it, and I've made Krita more and more comfortable to work with. But also, my art style is more to the simple styles.\n\nTimelapse feature, I heard in Krita it is being prepared. I've tested the alpha version and it seems decent. For now I don't use it as I always use OBS to record timelapse (I love to record the undo I did as well).\n\nIn comparison, CSP has tons more illustrative features (especially the EX version, with manga manager) but Krita is also amazing with it being free (with no tie) to begin with. Recently I tried to animate in Krita and it was surprisingly much easier for me to get a hold of it, in CSP, I needed a few days to actually get to work with the flow. Again, this is from my experience in using CSP first. Perhaps it was easier for me in Krita because I've learned enough in CSP to have a faster learning start in Krita.\n\nI will still use both software interchangeably, but for now as CSP is still not on Linux yet, I think I'll start using Krita more, unless I need those 3D models, which I haven't been so far.",

You will never be able to imagine the strength it takes for someone to ask you for what they need for their mental health or confront you about behavior that is dangerous to them and their condition. \n\nThe ABSOLUTE worst and most uncaring response to that is to accuse them of playing games, and denying that is an abusive response is gaslighting.  Interacting with someone you think is manipulating you is only going to lead to you treating them as if they are a manipulator which is abuse.  \n\n<3 A person with CPTSD."

I need the mothers' advice here!  This woman kept apologizing for her husband getting called in and not having child care. I have absolutely no problem/issue with that. I had let her know I was open all week, she made me pick a day and time, there was no communication before, she tried to ignore her kid hanging from her neck screaming and still act like she was listening to me, and I had to ask for a reschedule, then she forgot about the reschedule too.\n\nFrom the few messages where I declined another try and thanked her for her time it's fairly obvious she thinks I'm judging her for having a kid and having a family emergency in a really rough time. I'm not. It's hard to explain it, but it was more having to watch her continue to convince herself it was fine and this was okay when I have the entire week and she could have just asked for another day and what she needed there. I've had a lot of new mom friends that got really wrapped up in insecurity of the judgement of other women. I don't want to be part of that problem.\n\nI have to write an email back to the Dentist that originally reached out to me for the position. Do you think I should even mention the issues with the interview?  If so, what wording should I use to highlight it was the communication aspect not that she was a mom having a bad toddler day? How would you handle this?\n\nI was interviewing for the position that woman does at a different office in the company, so I'm on the fence if I want to ask for an interview with another person.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the advice everyone!  The longer I sat on it the more I decided to just send my standard thank you.  Not my chair, not my problem. It was in the salary range I'm looking for, which seems to be the only positive. I appreciate all the shares and personal experience!"

But, no matter how long they stay, it can come out sometimes for various reasons?  Well... aggressive, bad wording is the culture I grew up in. I'm proud of myself that I have managed to fix enough of that habit that it rarely is an issue anymore, but I think the actionable feedback here is that I need to find better wording for my interactions in text than I am using, not that I need to assume positive intent. \n\nIt helped me a lot and I really wished I found this way to explain it MUCH earlier in life.

I focus way too much in these kinds of thoughts, and I wish too not think about it that much, and sometimes I really don\u2019t think about it, but I feel that there\u2019s always those kinds questions somewhere in the back of my head. As for the intelligence part, I kinda got over it, and at the moment, I don\u2019t dwell on it too much, but ever since I stopped thinking about it a lot, I have now started questioning my creativity. And that got me thinking: am I always going to question these things? If I jumped on questioning my creativity so fast after I got over the fact that I may not be smart, I fear that even if I stop asking myself the question:\u201dAm I creative enough?\u201d, and move on, would I just find another thing to feel bad about?

Letting your partner or doctor know that you need some extra support is the next step. \n\nI relapsed HARD when pregnant and until my kid was about 18 months. Intense therapy and medication was the only thing thats been effective so far.\n\nYour nutrient needs do increase, so you will be hungrier. Know the nutrients are going to your baby, not just to you. For a little perspective, I lost 15 lbs by giving birth to a 7lb baby. \n\nMy 1st trimester I was super nauseous (Zofran is the bomb dot com!) and lost weight...l looked great, but felt like a trashpanda. Then my weight rebounded higher than ever and I fell into crisis ED mode. \n\nThings that I found out while pregnant and relapsing:\n\n1- ask the nurse to do blind weights (you turn away from the scale and the wt is not printed on any materials) which is absolutely necessary! If I was gaining too much, my doctor told my psych, not me. It was a blissful time.\n\n2- I had a few more ultrasounds to make sure my placenta was healthy and my baby was growing ok. Although not backed by science, I had a huge fear of rupturing my uterus or splitting my abs (vain, but it helped prevent a few purges).\n\n3- prenatals! Its not a miricle pill but its fills in nutritional gaps that may happen.\n\n4- pregnancy hormones tanked my mood and I was in a deep depression by 8 weeks. I took a low dose prozac (10mg) from 12 to 34 weeks. My ED and mood raged when not medicated. I breastfeed and had another bout of depression during that hormone change too. (Yay /s)\n\n5- I was labeled high risk. This can be a good or bad thing- I felt my level of care was great and thoroughly decided, but a doc wanted to keep me in the hospital longer for 'observation' and I had to meet with a social worker before discharge.\n\n6- the 4th trimester also fcking sucked EDwise. Being a ftm= lots of feelings of inadequacy, even when you're doing great. \nBeing able to be vulnerable with my partner and share my needs is something I'm still working on. But I know when I talk out my feelings it's better for my mental health.\n\n7- ideally recovery is the goal, but harm reduction is moving in the right direction. If you purge one less time, thats a celebration! If you crave something and eat it and keep it in, thats a celebration! I have a few more suggestion I can share if you're interested.\n\nWe're all here to support you \ud83d\udc9b\n\nSearch back in the sub for pregnancy... apparently we've been getting busy despite all of this -gestures widely-",

His bank accounts have beneficiaries listed.\n\nI've reached out to a few attorneys and their packages for wills/trusts are about $4,000, but understand that could be cheaper than probate. Thats a lot of money for my family, so I'm leaning towards finding online company that does this service.\n\nDo I need a trust for what I have? Is $4,000 the going rate?

For instance, supporting Lebanese nationalism labels you as a racist or a traitor (Palestinian cause being none of our concern).\n\nPeople assume we live in a capitalistic state while if you look closely you'll know for sure that we don't, we have a shit load of monopolies that were and are still protected by the state.\n\nWhen I say this I mainly speak of nationalism in terms that Lebanese people and their interests come first, even if it comes at the expense of others. As well as an anti-communist stand, and it's scary how people are quickly embracing communism instead of standing up for themselves properly. It's a very long debate, especially that how the \"revolution\" was dominated by lefties who barely know anything about how things function. (Long debate here, but general statements are not plans and not having a clue what election laws, policies, etc... are also not on your side as well as putting Palestinian and Syrian interests above Lebanese interests)\n\nSo my question is **\"Do you identify yourself as a right-winger?

For me, physical book is more appealing.\n\nWhat I learned here:\n\n\\- try different methods; drawing, sketching, and/or secret code/language. I remember reading some girls learning LoTR language, just to speak privately with her friend in class. It was something.   \n\\- I never thought about lock box or some sort, this is a good idea, to be honest.   \n\\- \"loose leaf and burn them\" - this is also an interesting concept for some stuff that I might not want to be in my journal.\n\nWell, thanks everyone."

After setting up boundaries and expectations, as long as everyone follows them you should be golden to follow \"yes and\". In the case of the inspiration thing, If a player is trying to farm inspiration, I'd go with it. Instead of shutting them down, turning it into its own fun side adventure where they are rewarded with a single inspiration (since it doesn't stack) doesn't seem too bad. Unless you're playing a game where the story is strict on its track (not my cup of tea but to each their own) then that should be an expectation set in the first place and like I said earlier, is fine saying no to.",

                "body": "Hey guys, been a lurker for a while but first time posting. This was some time ago so my recollection may not be perfect but i assure you select moments from this time will stick with me forever.\n\nCast:\n- JJ, the DM \n- Me, OP (Half-Elf Druid)\n- Jim, friend that would later become best friend (Half orc barbarian)\n- Chuck, DMs friend (Dragonborn Paladin)\n- Mary, friend who for short while would be my gf (dark elf rogue)\n\nThere were a few other players here and there but these were the only players that stuck around. Names are changed, obviously.\n\nThis starts bavk in my freshman year of Highschool, I had wanted to get into D&D for some time but never found people who wanted to play. Enter JJ, we have some mutual friends and says that he had DMed a few times and would be down to start a club with me. Dope! He seemed cool and friends spoke highly of him. I find some people to join: Jim and Mary. Had some classes with Jim and had a bit of a crush on Mary (I mostly regret us dating we wouldve just been better as friends). We show up at JJs house for first session, he says itll mostly just be character creation and stuff. I meet Chuck. Chuck is a good head and a half taller than me, loud, and constantly had his school given chromebook in hand. JJ explains that Chuck has already rolled his character stuff and that he could help us if we needed. We start rolling up sheets, but Chuck doesnt really contribute. JJ shows us the map and where we will be starting and calls the session good.\n\nI look forward to things as Id heard awesome tales of D&D and had attended (but not participated) in another session once. We start playing, and Im already kinda bored. No real encounters (combat or RP) and the only real solace is that the players have a fun reason to be together (we are all half siblings fathered by a mad sorcerer). We get a quest to investigate an obelisk. Alright cool except we almost get TPKed by an allosaurus. Session ends before the obelisk, and i miss the next one (but i heard it was mostly uneventful) but we get another tip to another area. Where we go and again almost get TPKed by Hellhounds this time if not for the bravery of Chucks paladin. \n\nI should probably take a sec to explain Chucks character. When I said dragonborn Chuck clearly has a different definition. No you see this isnt some plain humanoid with draconic features that has a shorter lifespan than humans. No, this is a human that can transform into dragons and has been alive for a few centuries. JJ has no problem with this (apparently anyway) and lets whatever Chuck says become canon. Chuck clearly is lying his lips off with his rolls (as he scoops his dice right as they land and proudly claim a high number and somehow rolled 3 nat 20s for his character that he rolled in private) and uses so much \"actual official homebrew\" that his lvl 3 character literally just carries our party along.\n\nAnyway.\n\nThe quest slowly becomes solely about Chucks PCs background and the other players grow uninterested. I start to get upset about things: Chucks BS and need to be at the center of attention and JJs love to throw ridiculous monsters at us (that only Chuck is capable of fighting). I start to complain about it to the other players, Jim shares my feelings and so does Mary to a degree. I bring it up with JJ how bored I am with the lack of plot and Chucks BS. JJ gets angry and defensive and tries to call me out for not participating enough and getting some rules wrong (I was still learning the system) and not showing up enough (sorry some of us care about keeping good grades). After some time Mary leaves, along with some other players who were new. Then I leave. Then Jim leaves. JJ says im not welcome at his table. I stop talking with JJ since as much as Jim tells me he just devolved into complete bullshit (to the point where the most RPing JJ does is raping Jims character with Apes)\n\nSome time passes and I play a few good oneshots with different friends. I dabble with DMing, and like it. I join a few other groups but school and family keeps me from commiting to anything. After some time JJ reaches out and starts displaying behavior that hes changed, Im hesitant but I say that ive done some growing myself and am more familiar with the system and more mature about how i handle conflict.\n\nStart playing. Same shit. Lack of plot. Consistent PKs and TPKs. And I discover that JJ clearly has something with vore as his favorite way to kill us is via being swallowed. We never made it past 5th lvl. To his credit he did get better at RP. But it was mostly to insert godly PCs or crazy lunatics that wanted to rape, murder, or a combination of both. I stop showing up.\n\nHavent talked to JJ in a while but i hope he figures out whatever it is he needs to."

I play dnd very often, and I enjoy it a lot. I play with a good group of friends online in multiple campaigns and we all place a heavy emphasis on roleplay, which I enjoy a lot. I\u2019ve had the chance to play a whole load of different characters with different ideals and histories, and I dare say I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at it.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue. When I say I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at it, I mean I\u2019m good at roleplaying conversations. Roleplaying expressing my character\u2019s thoughts on the party\u2019s current situation. Reacting.\n\nFor a while I\u2019ve noticed that my characters are lacking the depth and dynamism I want them to have, and I think the problem boils down to how I\u2019m roleplaying. Im mainly reacting to things in character. An NPC dies; I express grief to another party member. A character says something counter to my character\u2019s beliefs; I have an argument.\n\nWhile this has led to some great character moments, I\u2019m never really *doing* anything. Im not introducing stuff into the game, or giving my characters long term projects or tiny personal side stuff. Not being proactive in my roleplaying. \n\nI wanted to ask you all to write down examples in your campaigns of player characters being proactive. Anything fun you or your fellow players have done that seemed outside of the box or particularly imaginative. Maybe share tips on how to be a more dynamic, proactive roleplayer.\nThank you all so much :)\n\nTL;DR: I only react to stuff in my roleplay. Looking for ways to give my characters more depth by actively doing things of their own volition."

The emptiness that makes it feel somewhat abandoned, the slightly unsettling vibe, the odd familiarity, all nicely seasoned with that hint of 90's/early 2000's childhood nostalgia. This ticks all my boxes.\n\nTo me, this is a clear glimpse of the quality this sub and the liminal community had back when it wasn't as popular (as much as I hate saying that, since I genuinely don't want to be a buzzkill for the newer people, but I just want to be honest by sharing what I subjectively look for in liminal spaces and do not intend to gatekeep, criticize or upset anyone in any way).",

                "body": "There's this classic video by DavidCrypt on youtube called 'pictures that feel strangely familiar but are uncomfortable - compilation', which is a video that I think was uploaded closely before or during the height of the liminal spaces trend (and is also the video that personally got me into liminal spaces in the first place, so it holds a special place in my heart).\n\nI'd say almost all the images in that video, but especially the ones of the larger, more empty/abandoned places are what I personally feel are the embodiment of everything I personally look for in quality liminal space pictures. They have the aesthetics, and give off that somewhat unsettling (yet kind of nostalgic due to the 90's/early 2000's setting) 'vibe' fully.\n\nHowever, I also see another side to this, which makes things more complicated. It's kinda inevitable that changes that aren't favorable to the OG's are gonna happen if something blows up in popularity. This indeed leads to different subjective views of what a proper liminal space is, and admittedly, I have contributed some examples myself which can be considered questionable at best, especially when compared to the ones seen in DavidCrypt's compilation, and as such I'm personally not proud of them. But the thing is: I don't have good liminal spaces near where I live and was too passionate to not join in, so I posted them anyways, although I stopped because the quality wasn't quite on par with what I would've liked it to be.\n\nThis is partly why I do understand the perspective of many of the newer people who want to post their own subjective ones without having their freedom impeded on by the OG's and I would hate to see polarization between them result in hostility.\n\nSo since I would ideally like both parties to be satisfied, maybe an option would be to either create some kind of more strictly moderated 'TrueLiminalSpaces' subreddit ran by OG's, or add some kind of flair to this sub which people may only use if some stricter requirements (which could be based on image samples from (for example) DavidCrypt's compilation) are met. Of course, these are just ideas, and I'm not claiming that their implementation and/or functioning in practice is going to be ideal.",

Now let's go:\n\nAs far as I know, in the early to the later 2000's (so even before \"the Skrillex days\", for lack of a better term), Coki (which is an absolutely amazing producer btw) was one of the British pioneers of the entire dubstep scene as a whole, along with other influential pioneers from the UK like Skream, Benga, Mala, Loefah, Kromestar and quite some others. These pioneers kinda formed the early UK-based scene (mainly in London I think) where they experimented with deep sub-bass and a dark aesthetic, while taking influences from Jamaican reggae-driven dub music and 2-step garage (for the most part). Merge the \"dub\" and 2-step garage's \"step\", and I think this is how \"dubstep\" originally got its name.\n\nAs for Riddim, I honestly don't know if it was even used as an actual defined subgenre label back then, so I can't answer your question for sure, since I think there's more to it. Dubstep had a very different sound back then, which focused much more on the rhythmic elements as well as on the sub-bass impact it had, with much less midrange than modern-day dubstep (modern-day dubstep is often referred to as \"Brostep\"), thus actually making a lot of the early stuff sound at least a little similar to what Riddim sounds like today.\n\nThen, around the late 2000's/early 2010's, many American producers (including Skrillex as mentioned earlier) had altered the original UK dubstep sound over time, morphing it into the more modern midrange-heavy sound that most of us are familiar with, while popularizing it in the process. To clarify real quick, I don't necessarily see this as a bad thing, since I love both the modern and oldschool stuff, but it is a very sensitive (and even somewhat controversial) topic among the original UK dubstep listeners.\n\nNow, you may have noticed that even before the American producers changed things up in a big way, more midrange-heavy tracks were already out there in the UK scene, like many of the influential tracks that Coki produced (Goblin is a great example).\n\nI think the best way I could personally put it is that tracks like the ones Coki produced were a catalyst to American producers changing things up. But I don't know if Goblin specifically can really be considered \"Riddim\", because as far as I know, riddim is a dubstep derivative that I guess has always been its own thing, though that's not to say that its inspirations didn't include original UK dubstep. It's all quite confusing, hence the reason I'm explaining this in such a scatterbrained way, lol.\n\nI would *personally* classify Goblin as UK dubstep rather than riddim, though don't take my word for it. As I said, I'm no professional and I'm probably wrong about some things I explained in this fookin' huge wall of text, XD",

This forces me to bunch them up in large bundles which not only take up more space, but look ugly as well. I prefer to have single transportation possibilities that do the job without too many restrictions.\n\nTo give you an example, the cryo-stabilized fluxduct from the Thermal Dynamics mod can transport infinite amounts of energy, but unfortunately, the latest supported version for that mod is 1.12.2, so I wanted to ask if you guys know any mod(s) for 1.16.5 that add something similar.\n\nQuestions are welcome, since I'd like to know just how much info I forgot to add which would make answering my question easier. I guess maybe a mod list would be welcome, but this post would be far longer than it already is, so I'm holding off until I'm greenlit to post a mod list in the comments somewhere if necessary."

The profile works though, and I am satisfied with how my DT's sound with the profile enabled, since I find the DT's to still be an amazing set of headphones otherwise.\n\nSince I find an EQ to be important for the reason stated above, I was wondering if there is a way to feed EQ'd sound from the source into an amp/dac stack. I've tried to search around for a bit and I think people said it was possible if you use the correct connections, but the only connection on my laptop that I have is USB, which I think they stated it doesn't work with, and that I need either a coaxial or optical running from an S/PDIF (which I don't have) to achieve this (though please correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nIf there indeed is no way to do it with USB, then does that mean I will have to buy a physical equalizer (preferably 31-bands, like on Equalizer APO, though I guess at least 10 bands might work too) to connect in between my future amp/dac stack? If yes, I don't really know what to look out for, since I have no idea which ones are good for a budget of around 250-ish euros (I've seen some crazy high prices after a very quick search, though that might be due to them probably not being made with the purpuse of using with headphone amps/dacs, instead maybe being more tailored towards large/professional sound systems), let alone how any physical EQ between an amp and a dac affects the quality that the amp/dac stack should be able to provide without any additions.\n\nI greatly appreciate any help."

But since you're a scorpio and you seem to have a compatible personality with her, I can tell you're willing to put in the work and the effort to let her know that her feelings are validated. She will open up in no time with a great friend such as yourself. We need more people like you in the world lol.

In fact it is highly strong and because of that I can sense things really intensely and it more often than not has a negative effect than positive. My intuition comes out to play more often in my dreams and lately they've been extremely vivid. One dream I had was where I was at home during a major APOCOLYPSE. Reptilian politicians (Specifically Hillary Clinton) came out in a tank at the end of my dream and I think killed me, and that's where I woke up. But in that dream I was at home, with a guy who was sort of like a companion, he was really cute but tbh I don't really remember all that much of his face, I just \"know\". And in my house, it was much bigger than I remembered and there was this villainous dude chasing us constantly. Eventually I got to the exit door of my house and we escaped and that's where we met the reptilian queen herself. My next dream (these were days apart) I had my classmates with me as my companions. We also had an APOCOLYPSE and it appeared as though we were in some sort of desert with a really bright sun. Not a really hot sun, but just a very bright one. I don't remember much in my dream but I know we eventually came to this shelter that gave us shade and from far away we saw this dust picking up. And I could immediately tell that they were terrorists and they were about to ambush us. I could tell this from far away. I started running away to a mountain while my classmates stayed behind trying to figure out what the dust was. I yelled at them to run but they didn't listen to me. So I took refuge at a mountain right behind the shelter and I saw from far away (my vision was amazing, it could see things from far away) that they were capturing my fellow classmates. I then realized that the shelter we took refuge on actually belonged to the terrorists. I then had to kill a guy who was on the mountain, steal his clothes, and then I pretended to be part of the terrorists. They then put my classmates on their camels and I hopped onto one and pretended. I'm pretty sure I was planning on saving them but then again I don't know. The dream ended right there.

I mean we have some insight into FireNation propaganda in 1 ep, maybe LF and the DaiLee did such a good job that only they truly knew the full story of what's going on in the outside world.",

Isn't Ozai a threat to the world's balance not because he is a powerful firebender, but because he is the \"Firelord\" or Phoenix King or whatever? Perhaps im not good at thinking deeper, but, even if he doesn't have his bending, should we rly assume that noone will want to stay loyal to him, keep taking commands from him and keep the war going after the comet? Yeah ik that he intended for Azula to be FL and later lost the title to Zuko. But like, even as a non bender now... can't he still be a threat? The earth king is a non bender so does the fire nation find it unacceptable to have a non bender as a leader? I know that im probably unimaginative but in summary what im asking is, can't Ozai still be threat even without his firebending simply cause some ppl might still be loyal to him?\n\nAnwsers? Anyone?"

And if dogs are meant to be hated and despised. \n\n\"Raising or keeping a dog inside the house is not allowed in Islam under any circumstances, and even prevents the Angels of Mercy from entering the house, and deducts a large amount of a Muslim's worship reward on every single day,\" Dr Ali Mashael, Chief Mufti at the Department of Islamic Affairs \n\nHowever, a dog may be kept and benefited from outside the house for permissible reasons, such as farming, hunting or herding as explained by Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), he said. \n\nStreet dogs are either harmful or not, he stated. \"If harmful, they should be banished or killed 'if needed', but not because they are dogs or just homeless,\" he underlined. \"If harmless, they should be kept away or in a safe shelter, but never neutered or locked up until death.\" \n\nIt is NOT haraam (forbidden) to own a dog, though it is not hygienic to keep a dog in the house. \n\nIt is NOT haraam to touch a dog or any other animal. If the saliva of a dog touches you or any part of your clothing, then it is required of you to wash the body part touched and the item of clothing touched by the dog\u2019s mouth or snout. \n\nRabies is a neurotropic virus transmitted to humans via bites or scratches from infected animals such as dogs.\nFew serious health problems can be result from sick dogs. \"Dogs can sometimes carry infections or parasitic diarrhea that can be transmitted to humans, but nothing too serious\" She said \n\nThe prophet also said that a woman who kept a cat locked up and failed to feed it until it died, would be sent to hell, while a prostitute, who gave water to a dog that was dying from thirst was forgiven (Al Bukhari) \n\nCats are not\u00a0najis\u00a0(impure) in its sweat, saliva and whatever it expels from its mouth or it\u2019s left over food after it ate or drank. As for its urine, stools, blood and everything that comes from inside is all\u00a0najis. \n\nIf a cat drinks from a container, however, or licks ones hand before praying, then it would be mildly disliked (makruh) to drink from that same container, or to pray without washing off the traces of saliva from ones hand. This is if one suspects it to have eaten filth or is uncertain of its state\u2013whether impure (from eating filth) or pure. If a cat eats a mouse and drinks water immediately after, then the water becomes impure. However, by licking its mouth for a short while, the mouth is purified and it is no longer impure. [Tahtawi 1:18, Dar al-Iman] \n\nFurthermore a hadith, \n\n\u2018The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \u201cThey (cats) are not naajis, rather they are of those who go around amongst you.\u201d \n\n(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 92)",

Unfortunately I never have any friends who like the game so I just solo queue, which is incredibly painful.\n\nWell tonight, I had a random who played well and we worked well as a team, so I invite them to my party. We keep having some great games and before I know it we are D2 Div 1. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve just hit the jackpot with the most mechanically skilled and well-positioned teammate. There\u2019s no way they could be cheating, you can\u2019t cheat in rocket league! And they responded to my game chat messages! \n\nEventually the other teams started saying reported and I had no idea why they were saying that until one person said \u201cyour teammate has cheats on.\u201d I was like hold on what so I looked it up and that\u2019s how I discovered the rocket league subreddit and that cheating in rocket league is a hot issue right now.\n\nAnyways, I play one more game to pay attention to my teammate and look for the tell-tale signs of AI, and sure enough they were there. I had gotten all the way up to D2 Div 4 but I felt horrible and made sure that we didn\u2019t win that last game.\n\nMy concern is that my account will be banned or something? I had no clue they were cheating (because I\u2019m stupid and gullible), and I met them as a rando in solo queue, and they didn\u2019t really carry me except maybe one or two games. But.. from Psyonix pov will they think I was being boosted and ban my account? I\u2019m just worried. :("

I\u2019ve gotten a  tiny taste of research but I stopped because my lack of knowledge made me more of a hinderence than an asset.\n\nDespite my love for math, and despite my investment in math as a career and way of life, I don\u2019t feel like I know math at all. I know a bunch of definitions of things, some of their applications and connections, and how to apply different methods to solving problems such as solving an integral or finding convergence of a series. But I don\u2019t feel like I know math at all. Why do I learn math? What\u2019s the end goal?\n\nA basketball player, for comparison, will practice hours and hours their whole career to become more efficient\u2014to score more points, to jump higher, to be a better teammate. But a mathematician? It seems to me (now, I am young in my math journey) that math is just about learning stuff so you can learn more stuff so you can learn more stuff so that you can MAYBE contribute a small something to the field\u2014adding more stuff for someone else to learn later. What\u2019s the end goal? \n\nI\u2019ve always understood math as an infinitely explorable subject of study\u2014and I love it (and hate it) for that reason. But there\u2019s this *feeling* just gnawing at my gut because of this apparent \u201cpointlessness.\u201d I hope someone can understand and help me understand what I\u2019m missing.\n\nUpdate: Hey, thank you all for your thoughts! Sometimes I get so excited about the future I try to plan it all out and my young mind crumpled under the pressure of just how infinitely large math really is. Right now, I know I love math, and that\u2019s good enough for me. I\u2019ll worry about tomorrows self-fulfillment and satisfaction\u2026 tomorrow!\n\nI look forward to the future! Carpe futura!"

I have studied my brains out and prepared hard for this final. But my Achilles heel was the need to piss after drinking a 20oz sprite from McDonalds. Sat down with my exam (which was to be 3.5 hours long) and suddenly felt the intense urge to maintain homeostasis\u2014I needed to piss. Unfortunately (and unbeknownst to me at the time), there\u2019s this funny little rule that says I basically lose pissing privileges when I sit down with an exam, and don\u2019t gain them back until I turn in the exam. After an hour, only 1/3 the exam done, I turned in my exam to take care of myself.\n\nI guess you could say Calc II was \u201cpiss-easy.\u201d Anyways any tips to prevent the urge to piss?\n\nAlso, study tips for self study? This course I\u2019ve studied online, independently, with little interaction with my professor and none with my classmates. I\u2019m in high school so none of my peers or teachers are familiar with the math I\u2019m doing nor do they care much. Any tips appreciated!! :)"

I tried spawning them in and opening them, they drop nothing but the wrapping paper. I tried modding the loot table for them, same issue. I tried a mod called \"more presents\", its old and gifts don't unwrap. I tried triggering the xmas tree events and opening those, nothing inside them.\n\nAfter a bit of digging I noticed the wiki classified them as historic meaning the mechanic or an aspect of it was taken out.\n\nMy thing is why would they remove this from the game. Made me sad because fixing the mod I mentioned is out of my scope of abilities.\n\nAm I missing something? Is there a way to make them work? I've seen them on another server not long ago and they managed to make it work. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, it's my birthday and all my presents are empty :("

I was notorious for being an edgy wild child in the alt scene who smoked copious amounts of cannabis. I'd heard the term \"Marijuana\" before but never seen it written. I might have had a clue if I was ever in class. There was a list of popular substances and terms on an educational leaflet we were reviewing. The sherif asked if anyone had any questions. I raised my hand genuinely curious and asked: \"What's Mary-Ju-ana?\". Literally everyone laughed, even the sherif tried not to chuckle. He didn't even answer the question, legitimately thinking I was trying to be funny. I realized everyone was laughing because they actually thought I was trying to be facetious. So I played it off and had a laugh myself. I've never told anyone that story before.\n\nTL;DR - I had never seen Marijuana written out and asked what it meant in front of my classmates but narrowly avoided embarrassment because people thought I was joking and not actually dumb. Spoiler: I wasn't joking and I was actually dumb."

                "body": "There's been a lot of hatred thrown at detransitioners, and unfortunately, it's not just from places you'd expect.\n\nSadly, a not-so-insignificant portion of the hatred comes from within the LGBT community.\n\nThere's a widespread misconception that detransitioners are using their unfortunate life experience to spread hate and malice against transgender people. While it is very true that a few notable people likely have this despicable motive, the majority of detransitioners are not so deceivingly inclined.\n\nThey're regular, normal people, just like you and I.\n\nIt's difficult to face the concept that some people may experience significant enough regret years after transitioning to begin detransitioning. While they obviously do not make up the majority of transgender individuals, we're discovering that they may be more than outliers in a statistical sense, although more research is needed to absolutely solidify that claim. Reguardless of the ultimate outcome, detransitioners are a reality we must embrace and support.\n\nThe reasoning for the LGBT community to have difficulty discussing detransitioners is understandable. They've been politicized by conservatives worldwide as \"proof that transgenderism is a choice\" or that allowing people to transition is ultimately dangerous. A select few detransitioners have gone so far as to use their circumstances to promote that false narrative. Detransitioners existing in the first place provide a means of questioning and anxiety to many transgender people's solidified identities. But, reguardless of their weaponization by anti trans advocates, detransitioners that detransition due purely to regret (not due to transphobia, physical problems, etc) do certainly exist and we cannot ignore them. Medical science definitively proves the existence of transgender people. It likewise proves that transitioning is ultimately very effective at alleviating the mental stress of gender dysphoria, so much so that it is the current recommended treatment. Research further proves that successful, content transitions are most effective if started within a few years after the onset of puberty. In short, there is *undeniable evidence proving the existence of transgender people and the effectiveness of transitioning*. Of this truth, we shall accept no compromise and give no ground.\n\nHOWEVER, we likewise must accept the fact that some people, despite feeling absolutely certain of their desire to transition for YEARS prior, do begin to experience regret in doing so even years after starting the process independent of the results of transitioning or the social acceptance of their transition. And, unfortunately, some of these people were teenagers when they started. These detransitioners are extremely important, because they provide evidence that research into transgender care is far from complete. As we rightfully push for easier access to transitioning hormones and surgical procedures, we also reduce the ability of the medical system to screen out people who's discomfort could stem from other sources and potentially be worsened in the future by deciding to transition.\n\nThe underlying point in this discussion is that *there must be more long term research into transgender adults, youth, and transitional care*. Does this mean we halt pushing for transgender care and awareness? Absolutely not. It DOES mean that we fully accept detransitioners and wish them well, reguardless of how their stories may be weaponized by bigots. It means that we accept the branching of gender affirmative care to not necessarily conclude in hormonal and surgical treatment. It means we allow further research into what causes people to transition to further improve the medical care of trans youth and adults. It means we embrace the idea that \"gender questioning\", or even fully transitioning, does not have to conclude in HRT and surgery.\n\nWhile ultimately I understand that much in the way of this occuring is due to the despicable political landscape aimed at destroying trans people under the banner of \"protect the kids\", we still have to make the adult decision to accept that transitioning does cause life-altering changes that can never be fully reversed and as such is not something to be taken lightly. We're not those who hate us; our existence is based on medical science and evidence. As such, we must accept unbiased research into the causes of detransitioning  and how those findings may affect the concept of gender affirmative care. And, the most important point, is that we cannot hate detransitioners nor exclude them from our circles simply because they received an incorrect diagnosis when they were in highschool. After all, like transgender people, detransitioners aren't going to disappear.\n\nWe spread love, not hate, forever and always."

Honestly fuck nerotypicals. Put them in a crisis and you find out just how weak they're minds are where we, we are strong, we excell. They are good at being in time, we are good at solving the world's problems. \n\n\n\nNerotypicals can't do half the shit we do. When I'm hyper focused I feel like I have access to a whole new level of existence; more parts of my brain. I can think in ways the people around me could never hope to understand and it shows. I'm faster, a million times more intuitive and creative and as far as thinking is concerned I play on easy when I'm around them.\n\n\n\nNerotypicals have nothing on us. You're husband is good at his job because corporations and society values obedience and subservience, something nerotypicals get drilled onto them at an early age, making it apart of their personality, we don't have this problem. We are free to move around, make it up as we go - something they can only mimic. What we have is a gift, we live in a society that would tell you otherwise.\n\n\n\nYes I have been fired, had strained relationships, and can't remember where the fuck I put my phone. But in a society uterly obsessed with time and deadlines and expectations, it seems like only losses. But as soon as you let go of that; as soon as you create an environment conducive to ADHD - one where you are free to be creative and apply that good old - out of the box thinking - one where you are able to reach the hyperfocus state almost every day, you will see things differently.",

                "body": "It has been a wild ride! Unaddressed in this message, my marriage was very rocky due to my then-spouse's infidelity. I'd thought it was being addressed in therapy (both of us), but a week after grandpa passed and mid-prep with taking on mom, I found evidence of him cheating again. So, I separated into a spare bedroom, moved mom in with us for a couple months before I moved mom and myself out in prep for the house sale/divorce. My brother and sister hadn't been planning on being available for grandpa's funeral, but I finally told them what was going on with my marriage and they helped pack mom up. \n\nThat was the end of assistance from my brother. I can tell you that feeling dumped on breeds resentment. Mom lived with me in the one-bedroom apartment I could afford during the divorce (I took the couch) for 6 months.  In the mean time, I searched for housing for mom because it was increasingly obvious that my resentment to (everyone really) and my life change were incompatible. I needed escape on many levels. I wanted to leave my town and was invited by a longterm friend to find a job and an apartment by them. I found HUD senior housing within my mom's financial means (she still gets alimony) by my sister and I split to a new town at the beginning of this year. \n\nI struggle quite a bit because my sister is now bearing much of the burden of my mother.  She has in-laws and such that she can use as a support network whereas I had none as soon as I started the divorce, but I am keenly aware that it is a heavy weight on her.  She's my older sister, but I was often the leader in the family. I try to do much of the things required for mom's care from afar - doctor calls, Medicare re-enrollment etc., but I know that being treated like a taxi and personal shopper by our mother is very draining. \n\nI am still not in the best place in my life, I went through a bout of depression and am on the other side of it. I'm dating an awesome guy now and hope it works out for us, because much of my childhood experience has been shared by him and we understand where each other's trauma responses stem from. \n\nSo, it was the most hellish transition of my life and unfortunately likely too circumstantial for me to be of much help to  you.  \n\nI would say that if your parent is able to take on the basics of their own care and are not financially well off, look for senior HUD housing. There may be a several-month wait list so get in on as many lists as possible. The place mom's in is very nice and clean - it's not a nursing home nor a holding tank.  Just an apartment building of old people with some optional group bonding activities, but she's got some amenities like emergency pull cords for falls etc. I also got her a 'life alert' type necklace for her courage to be alone.  She's made friends and watches sports with people in the lobby.  Plays cards etc. She can catch the bus to go to stores if she wants.  She pays about $300/month for her housing and about $25 for her life alert button. Actively look for ways to make your parent more responsible for their own choices and make them decide on priorities. \"I can take you to the grocery and one other store this week, but I can't take you to 3 stores.\" etc. Now that I'm not in the hot seat as much anymore, I can see that mom is as dependent as she's allowed to be.  At times she's been told that she's responsible for arranging things, she's done so via bus/taxi etc. \n\nRegarding your brother-- maybe you can help him by being the research to help save him from himself. Not just let him know that there are things out there to help, because that's nebulous and full of holes. If you can, actively present him with some solutions - here's the phone number for local bussing, here's the website/email for this living community etc. It may not be wanted now, but when the care becomes too much, it might help him to know that he's not responsible for holding up your parent's world. \n\nIt's mix of martyrdom, hopelessness and clarity for me - but that's also why I'm in therapy to deal with the hurtful emotions when they are the stronger voice. \n\nBest of luck",

He'll pause and assess, then let me know if he's feeling tired (I'm his last client for the day) or if he's had some sadness over a sick pet etc. \n\nThis brief moment of honesty and potential vulnerability/trust from him has definitely strengthened our therapeutic relationship.

Maybe he plays with your thighs or outer labia then -- keeping nearby but not in direct contact until you can communicate that the uncomfortable feeling has receded. Red/yellow/green safewords are a good idea here - he can check in or you can check in and the color words tend to let you feel less vulnerable in the moment. It's just \"yellow\" instead of \"oh, I'm getting anxious\". \n\nAs far as getting into it - why not ask him for a yoni massage (with an oil he can ingest like coconut oil). It is a quiet, relaxing intimate moment that transitions very well into gentle oral. Get into a new mindset so that you're not as trapped by the ghosts of the past: Put on relaxing music, dim the lights, burn a candle with an unfamiliar scent. Ask him to stay relaxed and gentle until or unless you get heated up for more. \n\nEven if you don't orgasm, you did a loving thing together.  No failure in that!",

To have a space for an example of a healthy relationship including conflict resolution, consent and trust while still being fully aware that it isn't a friendship. He has discussed a humanistic love for each of his clients and I believe him. \n\nI know that a lot of therapists of Reddit have mentioned that they rarely to never self-disclose, but I have found it very helpful in the trust I've given my T. He and I had similar childhood traumas and similar challenges. He knows my personality is one in which I'm not convinced by being *told* something is true - *show* me. He has been able to be my living example of the benefit of putting the work into it and he's able to remind me of where I was at before so that I can see how far I've come.

I'm looking for a label to put on one of my carry-ons.\n\nI've read up on a little on fight, flight, freeze and fawn trauma responses. Maybe I missed it, but what would a learned response be categorized as if you've been forced to be stoic through your punishment? Is it something outside of a trauma response? \n\nFor best description, think of a private in the army being dressed down by a Drill Sargent--but starting at 8 years old. The only response allowed is agreement. Showing emotion, attempting to plead your case, having a facial expression, attempting to evade a spanking, face slap, or a squeezed shoulder muscle is with the fear that things could go much worse if resisted. Crying is met with disgust. Anger was only allowed if it was from my brother, not from one of the girls--but even he could not be defiant towards my father. \n\nIt has left an impact on all of us into adulthood. \n\nMy sister (oldest) became anxiously perfect--or arranged to look so.  It's only recently that she admitted to placing blame on myself (middle) or our brother if something went wrong when we were children. I don't remember being blamed for something I didn't do, so that's easy to forgive. She tends to disassociate--withdrawal and have loss of executive function. My brother now shifts easily to fight -- escalating emotional barbs to push people away with no thought to preserving relationships while he is weaponized.\n\nFor myself, I go still. I remain present, but I go quiet until it is necessary to respond. I stay watchful. I calculate best reactions and deliberate responses--though they're never as good as what I could think of when it is over. My mind flashes from fear where I tend to shrink within myself and my hands go cold, then swiftly into anger--but I don't let it reach my face other than the flush that I can't suppress. I maintain eye contact with the threat so that they know I am not running away.\n\nIt's easy to understand why an angry man brings this out of me, even in my 30's. I feel that I have been the one sibling to have stayed the most similar to what was accepted conduct for a time of punishment, and I wonder if this is a natural response or I'm simply following the template I was given. \n\nI'd appreciate it if someone could help me label this. Is it under the freeze umbrella though I don't dissociate? Is it a type of fight because of anger? Thanks in advance."

I'm a planner, so this is not immediate.\n\nThat leaves me to wonder - how do I hedge my bets in attempting to find another highly compatible therapist in the future? I have a feeling that I'm going to be a bit sullen -- firstly, is it advisable to wait a period of time so that I'm not judging others by the high regard I have for him? I'm very attached--he's my first example of a healthy relationship (I see him for cPTSD). Beyond the attachment, I feel very *understood* on a personality level--he's INTP and I'm INTJ where I hadn't felt validated previously, he can really pinpoint what I'm trying to explain. I have a hard time accessing my emotions--he's lived through worse than I, and knows how to break down the work into my language so that I can access very foreign concepts from an analytical level (both on a personality and a personal level).\n\nHe responded very well to my initial email inquiring about his availability to take new patients. Within the email, I outlined what I thought I was looking for (secular and sex positive). His response made me choose him. \n\nNow that I know what I've appreciated from my therapist, my list of hopes has grown. How is this perceived? Is it arrogant or helpful? \n\nThings that I've found to be important in therapy/counseling:\n\n-A humanistic approach\n\n-100% secular\n\n-View cPTSD as a valid concern even if it can't be directly diagnosed for billing purposes. \n\n-be very knowledgeable in treating childhood trauma/attachment issues. \n\n-Knowledge of MBTI at least to the point of understanding the line between where my personality traits end and my coping mechanisms start.\n \n-sex positivity/comfortable with very frank and open discussion. \n\nSo - is this too much? Is this something that would make you roll your eyes and move on to the next email of a prospective patient? I'm trying to manage expectations, while also hopefully advocate for myself in a productive way. I won't be everyone's cup of tea, and that's the point--but I also don't want to drive away someone who would be an excellent fit. \n\nI appreciate your feedback!\n\nEdited for formatting"

He loves me, but clearly he can't stop the need for sexual validation to compete with his body dysmorphia.\n\n10 year marriage, 15 year relationship. \n\nI plan to tell him tomorrow that I will ultimately be seeking divorce. I want to sell the house prior to divorce (our only asset beyond a car for each of us), use the profit to pay off our debts (and court costs), split the remaining 50/50. We make within $10k of each other, with me coming out ahead. I hope to have an uncontested divorce--though I've read that our state is no longer an at-fault state so I don't have much leverage beyond the massive amount of shame he holds for his actions.\n\nOur house is in need of quite a few repairs before selling. Much can be done ourselves, but I will need his help. Paying for repairs will majorly eat into the sale money as we still owe a majority of the mortgage (however we bought a short sale and there was instant equity at the time of sale which has stayed true in the current market). \n\nHere's the question:\n\nNo kids, spare bedrooms--how terrible of an idea would it be to suggest a roommate situation? I move into another room, we don't necessarily tell the world our business yet until we have a better idea of how this will play out and the shock wears off both of us. I want to preserve his dignity, and I don't plan on going public with dirty laundry as I ultimately wish him the best. He has more external supports than I do, so it's entirely possible that he will jet--but I want to make the offer as it seems best for finances. I have been accused of being too cold/logic-based in the past, and he's an emotional person...so I don't know if this is a bad idea. \n\nThoughts?"

My communication and trust issues fluctuated frequently. The 70lbs that I had lost in happier times came back over the 1st year.

He and his family made up 90% of my support structure. \n\nSo, currently I have little appetite or interest in reading (usually my favorite), video games, social media. My introversion has intensified. My love of answering Reddit questions to help others has died--I start to press reply and then stop. Have the last 2 years been all bad? No. I started one on one counseling and feel that I've really grown and have started to understand myself more. I've helped to create stronger relationship bonds with a couple friends and my sister. But, I've been more unhappy/lethargic over these past 2 years than normal. I never kept a clean house, but I have let it get worse. I pay bills late even though we have the money. I do not fear the consequences enough to stay on top. I am feeling less sharp mentally even when getting enough sleep. My anxiety has grown over the last 2 years as I have felt the affects of losing faith in my husband. \n\nDue to my mother's mental illness I fear medicating depression. A chaotic unstable childhood with various bouts of her depression and mania followed by the absolute emotional grayness that the aggressive mood stabilizers enforced has left me with the terror that 1). I'd be one step closer to being like her and 2). That I won't be me anymore-- and I *like* me overall.\n\nIs it likely I could get better on my own? Is it possible to use medicine temporarily? If there is treatment for temporary situational depression, is that marked in my medical files as lifelong depression? I don't judge others for their depression--but this stigma for myself runs bone deep. I feel like I'm grasping at weeds as I get swept downstream.\n\nThank you for reading this"

                "body": "TL:DR - I spent my pre-teen/teen years being an approval-seeking Cinderella for my work-focused dad in care/replacement of my mentally ill mother. Dad split, mom was cared for by her father--who is now very ill. My siblings can't/won't take mom in, so that leaves me at the last minute. My counselor asks \"Why? Why is this your responsibility?\" I have no epiphany--I'm too 'me' to avoid this and still feel like I've not shirked my responsibility.\n\n\n\nMy mother developed severe schizophrenia and bipolar when I was 3-4 years old. Due to the illness and aggressive treatments, I was often the primary caretaker (starting from when I was around 12 on a full time basis, though plenty of isolated events prior) of the family in general until I went away to college. I have an older and younger sibling, but they were often out of the home pursuing their interests.\n\nMy parents divorced shortly after the nest became empty, and my mother went to another state to become a dependent of her father once more. Due to his age, the siblings discussed several years ago the eventuality of mom needing to live with one of us (the idea of a group home or a facility is too close to when we used to visit her in the psych ward for us to bear even though I assume they are different). My sister was always out of the picture for mom-watch, she does not have the space. The youngest, my brother, was adamant that he take her as his job includes resources available for the housing, care, and legal concerns of caring for a parent. He advised he'd also bought a home with her care in mind. I was guiltily gleeful that this would not be my responsibility. I have a home with room and I have no children--but I also have a bunch of unaddressed trauma and resentment towards my parental relationships. I wanted to stay free, even though I felt bad that one of my siblings would not.\n\nThe time is coming very near as my grandfather was rushed to the hospital this past weekend. I called another meeting of the sibs (by video chat--all involved are in different states, even our mother). I am the closest geographically to mom, and planned to be very involved with moving her. My brother backed out--stating that his job requires him to travel too much at this time, and he'd not want to move mom in while he was traveling as that would be a burden on his spouse and kids. So that left me, of course.\n\nI brought this into my counseling session--along with all my anger, resentment, grief, self-sacrificing feelings. My counselor cut through all that with \"Why? Why is this your responsibility?\" I was brought up short...I just explained all the logic! I have room, I have no other dependants. My siblings will not have room or not be available. That leaves me! I don't have a choice. And again, he brought me up short--yes, I do have a choice and this is the one I've made but it isn't the only one available. There are places and they won't be like what I visited to see my mom in. I could choose to press my brother to make good on the commitments he made instead of this last minute dump in my lap. I could tell my sister that her daughter doesn't need a bedroom and a playroom. Everyone involved would have had spouses that will need to get used to mom, and it isn't my responsibility to twist my life around in an avoidance of their relationship strife.\n\nHe wasn't telling me what I should or shouldn't do--but was cautioning me to not cement this path as the only one available. To look inside myself and examine that feeling that made this an \"of course it's me\" moment instead of any of the other options. That I'm a good person no matter what I decide to do with this situation. \n\nAnd I could hear those words. They seem like real good words. Sound advice that I'd happily steal to use for a friend...but they haven't taken anchor in me.  No great epiphany, no realization that I've done myself wrong in the past and am determined to do differently in my future. I told him, and he said that's ok--he'll say it a billion times more in the future. I hope I can go beyond hearing to feeling them. I do very much appreciate my counselor, even when he might be shouting into the wind."

She has diminished mental/emotional capacity due to failed ECT treatments for schizophrenia in the 90's (and current mood stabilizers), but has improved as grandpa aged and started needing more care himself. It's fair to say that at this point they prop each other up. \n\nMy sibs and I discussed plans a few years ago regarding what we would do when grandpa passes. My brother was adamant that he was the best choice to care for mom. My sister really wanted to be able to take her, but doesn't have the room, resources, or marriage to make that possible. I have a lot of attachment trauma between both my parents--but mom is the one that got both barrels of my avoidant/dismissive attachment. I was all too happy to assist my brother financially in the care of our mother and was guiltily ecstatic that it wasn't me. \n\nGramps is in the hospital now, and he may not make it out. I called a video meeting between the sibs (there are 4 different states involved, but mine is the closest to mom) to confirm immediate plans in case we need to move quick on getting her. My aunts/uncles seem all too happy to have her in the family home while they can pretend that she's enough to care for an almost 100 year old man in failing health and avoid the need to deal with a nursing home. Previous conversations with them have alluded to the understanding that she will not be welcome after his death. Her attachment to grandpa is such that moving her ahead of time would have been traumatic, so this was always going to be a swift extraction.\n\nI asked what the immediate plans were and my brother said \"I dunno\" before launching into all the reasons that his job would be too busy right now to do anything. For 18 months at least. I get it--he really will be out of the state often and it's unfair to dump mom on a spouse like that. My sister's situation hasn't changed in the last several years, *so that leaves me*. \n\n**I never wanted this!!** I have thought for years about how convenient it would be if she just passed away (to be clear, of natural cause) so that she'd not continue to be a burden. I didn't get a true childhood, and I am resentful that the woman I helped care for when I needed care is now coming back to me. I thought I was free.\n\nI am devastated and so very unprepared for this. No one actually sucks here, and there is no one to be mad at. I'm 35 and yet I don't want to be an adult right now."

It became one of my favorite movies, and I felt that I could really relate to the lead's relationship to her alcoholic/abusive/tortured mother. \n\nMy mother is schizophrenic and wasn't physically or intentionally emotionally abusive. The trauma from that parent was in the emotional unavailability (meds: stabilizers), constant threat of suicide, parentification, absence during involuntary commitment, and significant short term memory loss from ECT for several years (in the decades since it has seen some improvement). I rejected her--both because I didn't want to end up like her and also because I was so *angry* at her suicide attempts. To child-me, it was the ultimate abandonment each time. \n\nI feel like the movie invited me to put my situation in perspective and give myself some room to feel for the childhood that I (and my siblings) should never have experienced, while understanding that my mother had ultimately little choice in her actions. It also let me highlight the good memories that I have of my mother-- like when she'd scrounge for some pocket change and we'd all pile into her old car (when she could still drive) and go to the local ice cream shop to share what I thought was the world's largest coffee milkshake. The movie slips back and forth between the good and the traumatic in the same way that my memories do. \n\nIt's not a perfect movie in terms of realistic healing timeline--and for some of us here it can be triggering and problematic in regards to plotline and family/friend pressures to reconcile. It's ultimately a drama/comedy  and sold as such with big names of the time. If anyone else can relate to this movie I'd love to hear about it!"

                "body": "Due to my mother's severe schizophrenia I made my counselor aware in our first several sessions that I was pretty tense about a diagnosis for myself because I frankly wanted to be *nothing like her*. It's what made me delay help until my 30's. He was very kind in how he approached my diagnosis-- C-PTSD, and even offered to wipe the session if it would hurt me to accept the label. Realistically, a low risk for him because I have a thing against getting anything for free, even 20 minutes of time. \n\nAfter he gave a general explanation, I was relieved because I feel that it is an \"of course\" diagnosis with my family history. It's also not a chemical imbalance, so for my own peace of mind it was well removed from what my mother has. Anyone reading this who has these illnesses, please know I'm not judging you--I have my demons to work through in regards to my mother. \n\nMy counselor is aware that I'm a very analytical INTJ and prone to researching improvements to fix problems-- seeking my own improvement does not escape this trend in my personality. I feel that my ability to be introspective is hampered by my lack of knowledge (and my struggles with self-compassion and empathy in general).\n\nI've seen my counselor for two years now. I like him--and I feel attached and trust in him. I believe the style of therapy is \"trauma informed care\", and driven by topics that I bring. He does normalize many of the concerns I bring--but for the most part hasn't actively pinned anything on my trauma response (unless I just wasn't listening--I'm in my head a lot). He will ask where I think a thought or action came from, and then I'll connect it if I can. Usually this sparks a \"some people find...\" kind of conversation from him. I love directness and wish it could be simplified with \"Hey, I suspect that's your trauma talking right now what do you think? \" <-- but I am also very much aware that I'm not the professional here and am largely ignorant regarding what may actually be an unhealthy tactic. I am aware I could ask for this and see what he says. I exist as a bit of a hypocrite as I love directness but tend to avoid requesting what feels like a favor (while simultaneously understanding that I am paying for this assistance and ignoring that).\n\nI came to my beginning sessions with significant relationship  issues (spouse emotionless infidelity stemming from his own trauma/BDD/validation concerns). 2 years of active work to reconcile and I am still sticking the toes of one foot out the door of our relationship. Prior to discovering the betrayal I had a very placid view of things--yeah it's not always 100% emotionally fulfilling but what's perfect? It was good enough. And now afterward I question whether it is actually good enough for me. Risk/reward - run and feel free.  Love again and get hurt again. Love again and fail to trust. Hurt another. Get more cats.\n\nSo I've been in this limbo of our relationship where we've agreed to both work on ourselves in counseling. I align with the idea that I want to fix *me* before I feel that I can properly help to fix *we*, but it also constantly lurks in the back of my mind as an unaddressed issue. \n\nSo here comes the part where in trying to research things on my own, I feel like I'm collecting labels. I have not yet addressed this in counseling, but plan to in my next session. \n\nAs I have been researching C-PTSD, I determined early on that I trend toward avoidant/dismissive attachment. I see where that causes me anxiety and pain in my romantic/family/friend relationships. I see how that colors my thoughts on extending myself towards new connections, and my practiced history of quietly but efficiently evicting myself from relationships where my vulnerability has become exposed/compromised. Simple arguments that became a mountain that I refuse to address to the point where I have ended the journey because it hurts/shames to either say \"I'm sorry\" or \"I was really hurt by this, can we talk?\"\n\nSo I've continued to research, bought a book on C-PTSD, and came across codependency. Now, I'd heard the word before of course, and my casual conversation context clues led me to believe that codependency is just another word for a clingy doormat. I don't mean that hurtfully--I never expected to deal with it in context of myself. \n\nSee I had no idea that it can manifest as acts of control, of refusal for help. Of actively choosing to put others' needs ahead of my own (rather than some overbearing partner enslaving me). I mean, I'm *so* independent. Autonomy is a religion for me. I don't actively look for people to care for; they fall into my lap. Some I have no energy for and ghost, but some few I'd turn inside-out for to accommodate. I don't have some desperate need to accommodate everyone--you have to be someone who got past my avoidant defenses and I *like* you. There is some quality I admire and I want your approval. I want to feel useful and like I've done a good thing. Even when I'd never ask for the same in return. I want to know that my deliberate care secures my relationship because I need that connection even when I say I don't. Because it wouldn't be logical for you to throw away someone who is so very *useful*. Even when I've begun to resent the imbalance I continue...until I run. I take pride in providing at first, but it can sour when I don't see a return in kind. I do have trouble setting boundaries when I see my partner as weaker. In need. It's so much easier to leave than ask for a line in the sand to be respected.\n\nBut does that make *me* codependant? I took a mental health assessment from a university website and scored moderate on their 60 question survey (33/60). I don't feel that I align with a good portion of the key words-- I'm not indecisive (beyond the hesitancy in stay/go in my 15 year romantic partnership). I make the decisions for the household almost entirely, my career, my interests, my alone time are mostly mine. Is there a codependency where I the afflicted keeps their running shoes on and their exits marked? Is this something else? \n\nIs C-PTSD a collection of all these ideas or are they separate? Have I gone from being afraid of a diagnosis to being greedy for labels to define what's wrong? \n\nI appreciate any thoughts.\n\nEdit--wrong word: illness, not disease"

If you feel discriminated against, report this calmly to your boss, and he should listen if they are on good terms with you. Don't be anxious, just be confident. that's just me though. obviously not just sheer confidence will be enough. You'll need a backup plan. Try to get these people to respect you enough to not just zero in on your gender. Also, try to be a wallflower until you transition. Another thought would be to look into legal loopholes. Make sure you don't think too much about your gender. Focus on work. But make sure to cover your ass; avoid the people who are scary and confrontational. basically, let it be known that your gender is unimportant by not talking about it or showing passion towards the subject. T takes a while to work. so hopefully you can transfer to a new workspace in 6 months to a year. It's probably best to hide the masculinization while you are working there to avoid confrontation.",

On the rest of the continent we have both Peru and Chile having regretted voting for hardcore socialism almost immediately, and I don't even need to bring up the obvious country. On the other hand Uruguay is now famous for being the most successful latam country, literally due to having leaned hard towards economic freedom. \n\nTo me it doesn't make sense, but on the other hand if I try to be unbiased I can *get* why my people didn't vote for Macri again in 2019 even when to me it was obvious that voting for CFK was glaringly stupid, I wasn't happy with Macri after all.\n\nSo yeah...

The band might not have been the biggest, roughly 60 members (29 winds on the field), and half the marchers were freshmen, but we kicked butt that season and saw the highest seasonal growth in the school\u2019s recorded history and finished off with a 73.250 at State. Since a lot of the group was new, we got to hit the reset button on the group\u2019s culture, and while it is still a work in progress, it\u2019s significantly better than it was my sophomore year; we actually feel like a band family!

I get that probably they went through some traumas, but I really can\u2019t tolerate their mannerisms and the way they are so victimizers. \n\nI\u2019m a pretty honest person, I\u2019m emphatic (I know cuz many people told me that, i used to be \u201cthe psychologist friend\u201d, and i\u2019m still it sometimes now), i like to listen to people and give advices to others. But i\u2019m also a very practical person. I\u2019m a rational person, i like to give solutions, and I don\u2019t like sweet lies. I don\u2019t want people to lie to me, so i\u2019m not lying to others because it won\u2019t give them anything to improve themselves. But I try to not be rude, obviously. I\u2019m not perfect but i try. \n\nSo, having around people who are always in the mood for complaining NOT WITH WORDS but with phrases like \u201cyeah but i got it worst\u201d or \u201cyou just can\u2019t understand\u2026 there\u2019s NO solutions\u201d is so EXHAUSTING. \n\nI have a sort of friend of mine, a roommate, who is so in the \u201ci\u2019m the victim\u201d side that when two of us tried to convince her to seek help for a anxiety problem she has she just look at me and said \u201cyou are so insensitive\u2026 a rock woman, no heart\u201d and my other friend was like \u201cwhat? Why? She just was giving you an advice\u2026\u201d\nI was stunned too, I didn\u2019t get what i said wrong. We tried to ask, but she didn\u2019t respond.\n\nI know that when people are hurt they want to listen to certain specific things that can reassure them that they don\u2019t have to go out of their comfort zone to feel better, but it\u2019s useless because it\u2019s false. And putting your insecurities to others is not fair.\n\nThis person is draining cuz she always wear the \u201csad puppy look\u201d on her face, and it\u2019s impossible to tell her something without upsetting her. She uses a child voice and is WAY TO NICE for her own good, and that leads to the problem: she always gives me something (like offers me food or smth) so i feel bad for not standing her. I don\u2019t HATE her, but she gets me easily irritated cuz she sometimes takes too much intimacy (look at my phone, touch my things etc), and then i feel bad because she\u2019s nice. But TOO NICE. I\u2019m nice too, but she\u2019s a people pleaser. I tried to tell her a time that she needs to love herself a little more, but or I wasn\u2019t able to explain or she wasn\u2019t able to understand that \u201clove yourself\u201d doesn\u2019t mean being selfish.\n\nI had met people like this, and it\u2019s always so hard for me. I know i can be harsh and i do what i can for helping, but I really hate walking on eggshells just because some people doesn\u2019t want to question themself\n\nI respect weak spots, insecurities and anxiety. I have them too. But these people want to make them their entire personality. It\u2019s like the emotional vampire in What We Do In TheShadows"

After a bit of research, we noticed his enclosure was wired and too small for the hamster (it was the one they gave him in the store), the substrate wasn't safe or deep enough and he had no wheel which seems to be essential. At first we changed the substrate and were saving up for a wheel, but the enclosure is so small a properly sized wheel wouldn't even fit (he's a fairly big syrian hamster). We were trying to make changes along the way to change his living conditions, but we're students and we can't afford a bigger enclosure. I can't even find properly sized bins and the fish tanks are too expensive as well. \n\nMy roommate and I have been talking about how the life we're giving him is not fair and that he needs a better one, but the thing is we don't know if returning him to Petco might be even worse. The hamster enclosures are, in area, smaller than the one he has right now, and if they sold our friend that cage and even offered a hamster ball, I don't know if having him return there would be better or worse for him.\n\nI really don't know what to do right now, and days go by with him in that tiny space biting at the wire at night and monkey barring. Should we return him?"

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the protein we consume does get stored for later usage, maybe in the muscles themselves until they\u2019re ready to begin the repair process.

This is the Hedgehog's Dilemma. So we seek solitude, believing that if we isolate ourselves we will avoid the pain of relationships. But when we do this we are left feeling nothing at all, and once again crave intimacy with another person. And so we go. The message of Evangelion was that even though you will potentially experience pain when becoming close with another person, it is worth it because to do otherwise is to not really even exist.\n\nAnd this is where I see Chainsaw Man going. Asa is alone yet desperate for intimacy, and becomes excited when the possibility of a relationship comes about, but when that potential love is rejected or unrequited she is hurt even more than she was when she was alone. Denji too has been constantly betrayed and rejected by the women he falls for, but none the less has continued to pursue relationships. I believe that Asa will eventually decide that at least pursuing a close relationship (with Denji) will be more worth it than continuing to be alone. Nayuta and Yoshida attempting to block their relationship from developing is simply a means to create drama and further this struggle between loneliness and intimacy. I also see Nayuta coming around and realizing that Denji truly is miserable being alone like he is and will allow him to pursue a relationship with Asa. Yoshida on the other hand is absolutely not to be trusted."

B has depression which affects all aspects of her life and I try to be understanding about it but I don\u2019t always understand and this last time it affected our friendship it triggered a meltdown for me. \n\nFor the last fee months B has been pulling away. Doesn\u2019t reply to messages, barely interacts with me in person (normally just hi and bye), and has failed to follow through many times. \n\nWith that said, B has been very consistent on doing these things with her family and a few other friends. B will take trips on vacation, text them back, etc while I (and quite a few of B\u2019s other friends) get ignored, flaked on, etc. It\u2019s been making me very frustrated. \n\nSo after a few months of this, I asked to speak to B one day after church. B said they couldn\u2019t stay late and that we could  text/talk later on the phone. I text B later to see when would be a good time to talk but B didn\u2019t follow through. I didn\u2019t hear from B until I contacted her the next day, and at which time I told B that I felt neglected as a friend and how it\u2019s bulls*** that she can act friendly and follow through with some people but not others and how I was hurt by this behavior. \n\nB did not respond and I tried to let it go. The next weekend, at church I didn\u2019t speak to B as we were sitting too far apart. After church as I\u2019m leaving and talking to another friend, B is following close behind us as if she wants to say something but she never did. I haven\u2019t seen or spoken to B since \n\nAm I in the right to feel the way I do? Should I apologize to B and/or give her another chance? Am I not being understanding as someone who is also ND? \n\nTl;dr\n\nI had a meltdown on my friend with depression because I feel like they don\u2019t care about our friendship. I called out my friend because she treats other friends and family better than me and some of her other friends. She didn\u2019t respond. We haven\u2019t spoken since."

Why were we so obsessed with toxic vampire boys?\n\nEPISODE DESCRIPTION:\n\nRenee is back with her questionable fallen angel content this week as she takes Mary through Blue Bloods by Melissa de la Cruz. This book of nothing but exposition follows Schuyler van Alen, your average 15 year old weird yet pretty social outcast, as she finds herself entering the world of New York\u2019s rich and immortal. That\u2019s right, she\u2019s part of an elite group of vampires. As she learns about her true identity, she finds herself dragged into a murder conspiracy by a cute boy who happens to have a very clingy and jealous twin sister. Join us on this journey that includes ancient IVF procedures, a dermatologist moonlighting as a therapist, and a historically inaccurate retelling of Roanoke. How does this relate to fallen angels? You\u2019ll wish you never asked that question by the end.\n\nEpisode Source Material:  \nDe la Cruz, Melissa.\u00a0*Blue Boods*. Hyperion, 2006."

In my dad's birthday (some weeks ago), he gave me the first slice of cake (it's tradition to give it to the most important person to you) and said \"I'm giving it to (deadname), ok?\" He had previously said that he knows no (real name) and that he raised (deadname), that he doesn't have a son, he has a daughter and that I could be a man, but not his child. I love my dad. I don't want to lose him, but I can't keep living as a girl. If only I had been born right, none of that would be happening.\n\nI feel like I'm never going to be a real man. There aren't even surgeries capable of giving me a real dick. It's written \"female\" in every cell of my body. I wasn't born a man, I wasn't raised a man, I didn't have a boy childhood. If you look at any picture of me that isn't from this year, you'll see a long-haired, female, hyperfeminine, pink-wearing girl. I can't fucking get rid of that. \n\nI'm never going to be loved, I'll never have a fulfilling relationship. I've gotten to the point that I can't even look at heterosexual couples, because, if I'm attracted to the man, then that means I'm the woman (ugh, what a disgusting fucking word) and that makes no fucking sense because I was supposed to want that, I was supposed to want to be the perfect little princess who likes the man because guess what? I fucking do like men, I didn't have to do anything, but the straight relationship that everyone seems to put as the ultimate manifestation of perfection just felt to me like eating something I don't like. And mlm relationships have all the perfection straight relationships don't. Men are so... magical. I can't tell what it is about them, but it's beautiful and I want it. And when they interact it's this wonderful thing and their relationships... oh my god, the relationships between men are beautiful, just beautiful and magical and I can't fucking handle the fact that this is denied to me just because I happen to be born in this fucking body. It's not fair, it's not fucking fair.\n\nI want to kill myself so I can be born male. I don't see another way. I'm always going to stay in this limbo. Even if I get to transition and make things a little bit better (or a lot, who knows?) I can't handle the fact that I'd have to sacrifice my relationship with my dad for this. Why does this have to happen to me? Why was I born in this fucking body? Why can't I just be cis? Why does it feel like the only way I'll ever be happy is killing myself and hoping I'm born right the next time? I don't even fucking believe in reincarnation or any afterlife, but the little chance that it's real and the 50% whithin this small probability that my next life will be in a male body is what's giving me hope right now."

Societal norms don't matter in the long run, but that just means you can live without worrying about them. Just because life has no meaning, doesn't mean anything you do is pointless, because, if it makes you happy, then there is a point. If the idea that being remembered by your achievements makes you happy, go for it. If living according to society's standards makes you happy, then do that. If rebelling is what works for you, then rebel. If you like staying at home on the Internet all day, then just go ahead.\n\nJust because something has no real meaning to the Universe, doesn't mean it's pointless. Take video games, for example: spending your whole day playing won't help anyone, won't make a difference in the long run and will make those hours meaningless, but, if you enjoyed yourself, it won't be pointless. I just don't get what people find so depressing about nihilism, I find it quite liberating and, to be honest, this melancholy when faced with meaninglessness and most people's over adherence to anything that tells them that their life is meaningful (i.e. religion) just sounds like an arrogant form of Stockholm Syndrome."

It ends a bit too soon though, it feels a bit weird to just end it there. The beat just stayed the same through the whole song, which felt kinda bland.\n\n**2) Test me:**\n\nAnother song that I really like, more than Notebook. It feels less... static. The chorus sort of reminds me of Nurse's Office, which is actually pretty neat, since the lyrics could be considered complimentary (Mel says she'd rather be tested by goddesses, which could be a reference to Lillith, the way she said she wants to be tested because she's mortal, which reminded me of how Lillith said they must feel the pain of the physical world, etc.)\n\n**3) Brain and Heart:**\n\nSounds a lot like Piggyback. I know the beat is different and it's just the same instruments and, don't get me wrong, I really like the beat, but it ended up sounding A LOT like Piggyback, even if you consider that. The lyrics aren't quite her best, they're eh. The song is pretty relaxing, but that's about it. It's also static, like Notebook, which maybe isn't as much of a problem as I'm making it out to be, but it really bothers me and makes the song feel bland.\n\n**4) Numbers:**\n\nOne of my favorites. Mel rapping was definetly something I needed in my life. The lyrics really reasonated with me and with problems that both me and my friends have been going through. The bridge is one of my favorite parts, for sure and the slow down at the end was a great effect. Reminded me of the first times I listened to Crybaby and K-12, specifically how I cried with them. My favorite songs are the ones that make me cry and this is one of them.\n\n**5) Glued:**\n\nI love and dislike this song at the same time. The bubble-y sound is so unsettling and comforting at the same time. I'm comforted and uncomfortable at the same time. The feeling was so overwhelming I couldn't even pay attention to the rest.\n\n**6) Field trip:**\n\nI LOVE this song. It's like it came in divine timing with the things going on. The beat is mostly static, but it's balanced by Mel's singing and the lyrics are AAAAHHHHHHHHHH\n\n**7) The Bakery:**\n\nI don't like The Bakery. It's a song I relate to, but still, it's so bland. I get that it's supposed to be repetitive, but I don't know. It's just not interesting. The lyrics are great tho.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, my favorites, in order, are:\n\n1. Field trip\n2. Numbers\n3. Test Me\n4. Glued (I didn't know where to put it, so it's right in the middle)\n5. Notebook\n6. Brain and Heart\n7. The Bakery"

They have little to no self awareness and even less empathy for what our crews have to put up with. I often feel like I'm the only adult in the room, especially when they get into a screaming match with a street crew or facility staff member over the phone. It's exhausting, I feel like I can barely step away to use the bathroom or something horrible might happen. Strangely, they get along fine with me, but I chalk that up to me being capable of coexisting peacefully with everyone I've worked with, ever. Management doesn't seem to care, despite this person constantly calling off, coming in late and leaving early. I've worked multiple 12 hour shifts alone because of this.\n\nI try hard to take care of my crews and our affiliates despite all this. I've been told that it's noticed and appreciated, but we still can't keep anyone on our shift due to the toxic behavior of my partner. We're chronically short-staffed and it's becoming very stressful to meet expectations without running the crews into the ground.\n\nToday I hit my limit. My partner was on a particularly bad streak of fucking over crews, sending them to runs out of their appropriate area and then whiplashing them across town to the next without any breaks. We're a transport company, so it's not like most of our runs are emergent or even urgent response. I've been dealing with this person since May and I just couldn't be bothered to try and moderate the insanity today. So I gave up and just let them run things. And I feel terrible. I get off the same time as many of the crews and usually make point of spending some time with them while they finish charts and whatnot. I could hear them venting their frustration before I got to the crew room and I just quietly left without saying anything.\n\nNow I feel horrible, like I let them down and I needed to come clean somewhere. Thanks for listening to my rant."

I'm also happy to hear about other cities out West as well, I'm not quite set on Vegas.\n\nI've been an EMT/Dispatcher in the Midwest for a few years now and I'm looking for better work opportunities and a dryer climate for health reasons.\n\nThanks in advance."
