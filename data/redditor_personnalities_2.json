Nowadays, if I pick up on any red flags that may indicate any form of abusive or manipulative behavior, I keep my distance.\n\nI want to feel safe and have mutually enjoyable interactions with people. I want the peace of mind of knowing that if one or both of us falls on difficult times, we're gonna be there for each other to the best of our capacity.",

Him constantly insinuating that you're childish is incredibly pedantic and rude and would be even if you weren't struggling with ADHD.\n\nIt doesn't seem to me like the issue is really communication. It seems like he's got such a limited perspective on life that he's expecting more out of you than should be expected of the average person, and he's making you feel guilty and triggering you for not being able to live up to those unrealistic expectations.",

The problem is, she can't accept the fact that I have something called leisure time - I still work full time and go to school on the weekends, but still manage to go to the gym, buy groceries, and play games, not like I had a lot of time for myself but still more than her, she can't accept that no matter how I try to explain to her that even though we live together we have different schedules, and I shouldn't be ashamed of me having time for myself. It sometimes feels like she wants me to serve her 24/7 because of her life choices. I still have hope that after she finishes school in a few months things will get better, but it's just so draining and rage inducing that my partner is so envious of my time off the clock. I can't stand it, it leads to every kind of fight at least once a week. I had an assumption lately that she's a workaholic that measures her worth by how much she works - that's probably due to her parents terrible parenting. Arguing with her is like talking to a brick wall that nothing gets passed through. It's very very hard for her to understand any point of view different than hers. I love her but the amount of stress she causes on my life is terrible, the worst part of all she doesn't realize it, even after I told her just that, what can I do to fix this relationship? Should I wait? Should I do - what?"

I know you said you already know it's bad, but that alone will probably bump you to high silver. Your crosshair placement is already fairly disciplined. I would honestly recommend grinding out some FFA. Don't worry if you are getting your ass kicked, you're there for practice, not winning.\n\nAs for other tips there honestly isn't that much to say that you did poorly. The first thing I noticed was you using nades to self heal while you were already in cover and no one firing at you. This is a huge waste in OW2 because we now have the support passive that heals you automatically.\n\nYour positioning largely wasn't that bad, you usually were near cover, which is the most important thing. Though you were a little quick to abandon your cover/high ground which lead to you seeming a bit lost during rotations and just getting caught out in no man's land. You can fix this by making sure you look around at where your team is and where they're moving before you decide to reposition.\n\nFinally, nano usage was kind of lack luster. I feel like you were only nanoing your tank and never tried to save it to use in conjunction with a team mate's ultimate. I definitely saw one or two used while your team was already out numbered and had no reason to engage in a fight yet.\n\nI got to say it though, there were just a lot of duels you were in that if you'd landed more shots (even if it didn't kill the guy) could have easily swung many of those fights. I would also recommend waiting for more opportunities to anti-heal targets as your team moves in. You landed some good ones, but usually it was already mid fight and you were already down a player or two.\n\nSupport role (and Ana especially) is all about making plays. Whether that's out dueling someone, landing nades to support a team mates engagement, or comboing nano with a powerful ultimate. But if you are serious about getting out of bronze, improving your aim will easily give you the most mileage, even up through most of gold. Hope this helps, cheers!",

My mom had me because she wanted to have children. She literally married a man to have children because that's the only thing she wanted. She probably didn't even love my dad since she always says she wasn't that attracted to him anyways but she simply wanted to have kids... \n\nWell, because of her motherly necessities, she had me. \nI was living a happy life when I was a kid in my natal country, didn't have complaints. I knew we didn't have much money but I was a kid. Although I always had food and all that. But our house was trash. Still, I could go to the house we had in a little village and it was full of nature there and I used to enjoy and had a good time. I also had my grandparents there and I used to enjoy having family members. \n\nWhen I was 6, my father decided to emigrate. He came to a first world country. I'm not gonna state which one. And he decided 6 months later to bring my mom and me too. \n\nI remember the way we came. I remember I shed a tear when I was leaving my country. But I didn't realize how much I would miss my country afterwards. \n\nAnyways, we came to a little city. I was bullied, people hated me because of being an immigrant. We didn't have much money so we could never move. My whole entire existence, I've been outside once a year. To the beach. The rest of my days I spend them at home. I've been spending my entire years at home. I didn't see anything else. I studied, I finished a degree, with scholarships... Etc \n\nBoys didn't like me, I don't like them either. I live in a country with a really different ethnicity that mine. I'm white, but still I look from another country. I don't fit her. I never did.\n\nI never felt accepted. I didn't have more family except of my parents. I had abandonment issues since I was a kid. I have an anxious attachment style and I'm codependent because I feel extremely lonely. Every day of my life I get this extreme pathological feeling of loneliness. I have no friends. I also don't want to. Most people don't understand me on a deep level. I didn't even have a boyfriend. \n\nNow my parents want me to go to another country to study, because I can't get a job. Even this country is a first world country, people also emigrate from here. \n\nI have to emigrate to another country to get a fucking job. I feel like I can't take it anymore.\nI'm feeling extremely lonely. I hate this. I hate being lonely. \n\nAll my shitty life could have never happened if I wasn't born. I suffer from anxiety, depression... Etc. \n\nPlease don't do this to your kids. My parents love me and gave me everything they could. But it's still not enough. I feel like I'm disabled emotionally. I have so much emotional pain. \n\nAnd my parents blame me for being \"lazy\" or not being able to do anything. I've been looking for a job in my career for a long time and I didn't even find anything. \n\nI'm done. I want to be free"

Most of my friends find the tax side of things boring, but it is very important to strategic planning. It sounds like it may behoove you to get a CFP. Part of the curriculum is tax planning, and that should open doors to work in financial services. You don\u2019t necessarily have to work on the sales/advisory side. I see people with CFPs in back office roles, although honestly it may be easier to get into that type of role starting in sales and then becoming a sales consultant. However, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible to do something analytical for a financial services company with a background in data analysis and CFP. Maybe you could consider business analysis for marketing systems.",

Compounding makes a bigger difference over longer period of time, so if someone in their 20s buys whole life instead of investing in SPY or VOO, then there could be a large opportunity cost assuming that future stock returns are similar to historical returns. \n\nWith that 6% growth rate, I\u2019m getting about $725k by the end of year 15. (You may have ran it as an ordinary annuity rather than an annuity due.) Then if you continue to grow the $725k for another 5 years at 6% it comes to $970k. So the Insured would at least need to survive more than 20 years in order for an investment that grows 6% every year to have a chance of getting a higher return than the death benefit.",

You all noticed the army rolling around everywhere like it was martial law, right? But did everyone see this scene? Immediately after the boy puts his shoe on, Elliot and the boy walk by a playground with people in it and soldiers outside. I had to freeze the frame to be sure, but the playground is fenced in and on the fence it says \u201cArmy National Guard Detention Center\u201d and they have a line of civilians outside the fence in restraints. Why would they be rounding up and detaining random people? The FBI believes they know who was responsible for the hack, so why suddenly detain people in playgrounds while letting Elliot go free? It seems like Elliot is in a military detention center. Possibly Guantanamo since one of the movies playing at the theater they go to is \u201cBy The Sea.\u201d I guess Darlene didn\u2019t get him immunity?\n\nEdit: Also there was a playscape on the beach where they were sitting similar to the fenced in area, which seems to imply Elliot is within the fence.\n\nEdit: http://i613.photobucket.com/albums/tt211/SilkLife/A765F8B4-BD4D-46BC-8E1C-A12D570F1D4D_zpsfflubj1v.jpeg"

I like and need a supportive mattress and do not like a soft, sinking in feeling but on the other hand, I don't know if the firm mattress would cause too much pressure. My PT recommended a medium firm or firm. Also, I share a queen mattress with my SO and he prefers firmer the better. I weigh under 120 lbs. and he is about 165. I'm thinking of getting the firm and if it's too firm for me, the company says it will work with you and provide a topper.  \n\nAny thoughts or recommendations?\n\nAnother question--if I do end up needing a topper, is it possible or practical to cut it down and only have it on my half of the bed?"

I told the cashier to tell the kitchen use separate utensils and to be careful because I have a dairy allergy. I didn\u2019t see him go back and tell anyone so I thought maybe he typed in the instructions in the order on the screen? I sat for 30 minutes waiting for my pizza and I got the feeling something wasn\u2019t right. Then I saw the guy in the kitchen get my pizza and cut it WITH THE SAME CUTTER as the other pizzas. When he tried to give it to me, I asked him if he used separate utensils and if he was informed that I had a dairy allergy and he said no the cashier never told him. One manager was gonna remake my order and he started it but I was like no got the attention of the other one and got a refund. Yeah how careless these people are. The piece of shit at the counter never even bothered to tell them. How do these people go on about life endangering peoples lives and not caring?

When the kids were little we\u2019d trade off with some friends for date nights, we watch theirs, they watch ours. Even grandma would come over for free now and then to have some baby time. \nWe are rural so having sitters, essentially strangers, off in the middle of nowhere as we are an hour away on a date is impossible. Now we have more kids, friends have their own lives and their own families and their own child raising (sorry I\u2019m not ok with 10yo fist-fighting to establish \u2018dominance\u2019? What?) and we cut my parents off because free childcare is never worth the risk of emotional trauma (they started pulling narcissistic nonsense when we were out) \n\nI realized my dear husband hasn\u2019t had a date with just us two in years now. We keep discussing it and are \u2018ok\u2019 because there is literally nobody we can trust with all 7 kids where we are. The village is RIGHT THERE but all I can do is look. I sometimes wish I had lower standards, more faith in humanity, or maybe a touch of negligence for selfish reasons. But I don\u2019t and that\u2019s that. I\u2019d rather have healthy happy adults in 10 years without dates than have a few years of fun and have something horrible happen. I know it\u2019s my choice. I\u2019m not pouting\u2026 entirely.

No ano passado certos problemas levaram meus pais a se separarem, e n\u00e3o foi um div\u00f3rcio amig\u00e1vel. \u00c9 uma hist\u00f3ria longa, ent\u00e3o esteja preparado para ler um texto grande.\n\nComecemos com um perfil b\u00e1sico deles:\n\nM\u00e3e:\n>Irm\u00e3 mais velha de dois. \n\n>Pa\u00eds r\u00edgidos e helic\u00f3ptero (at\u00e9 hoje querem se meter em tudo o que ela faz).\n\n>Cat\u00f3lica tradicional. Catequista.\n\n>Trabalha como dentista.\n\n>Provavelmente a pessoa mais \"p\u00e9 no ch\u00e3o\" que eu conhe\u00e7o. Prefere lidar com fatos concretos \u00e0 abstra\u00e7\u00f5es.\n\nPai:\n>Filho mais novo de seis.\n\n>Pa\u00eds permissivos (minhas tias dizem que ele foi muito mimado)\n\n>Come\u00e7ou a fumar e beber aos 14 anos de idade, o que estragou seus \u00faltimos anos na escola. Parou ap\u00f3s eu nascer, por exig\u00eancia da minha m\u00e3e.\n\n>Ap\u00f3s parar com os v\u00edcios, resolveu mudar de vida e se formou em Filosofia e depois em Engenharia Ambiental (j\u00e1 tem uns mestrados no curr\u00edculo).\n\n>Nasceu como um t\u00edpico \"cat\u00f3lico brasileiro\", mas virou adventista, e depois esp\u00edrita, depois se meteu em v\u00e1rias organiza\u00e7\u00f5es ocultistas. No momento, t\u00e1 na umbanda. Orgulha-se de n\u00e3o se apegar a religi\u00f5es.\n\n>Acredita numa caralhada de teorias duvidosas (cristais t\u00eam poder, Atl\u00e2ntida e Lem\u00faria existiram, Hitler era na verdade a reencarna\u00e7\u00e3o do Imperador Tib\u00e9rio Cesar e um esp\u00edrito elevado que provavelmente est\u00e1 no c\u00e9u agora...).\n\n>Diagnosticado com Transtorno Obsessivo Compulsivo, mas nunca quis se tratar porque acha que tem poderes medi\u00fanicos.\n\nMeus pais come\u00e7aram a namorar no in\u00edcio das suas fases adultas (ela, virgem e sem ter nenhum outro relacionamento; ele, tendo tido v\u00e1rias namoradas) e j\u00e1 brigaram v\u00e1rias vezes durante o casamento, pois muitas vezes meu pai tentou controlar a minha m\u00e3e, inclusive quanto ao trabalho dela. Ela \u00e9 feliz como dentista, mas ele vivia pressionando ela a arranjar um trabalho que desse mais lucro. Ele tamb\u00e9m achava que os pais dela eram muito autorit\u00e1rios e vivia brigando com eles, enquanto tratava os pais dele como santos.\n\nFalando dos meus av\u00f3s, meu av\u00f4 era uma das pessoas que mantinha meu pai sobre controle. Por mais que tivesse tend\u00eancias \u00e0 desconfian\u00e7a beirando a del\u00edrios, meu pai sempre confiava no meu av\u00f4 e acreditava em suas palavras. No entanto, meu av\u00f4 sofreu um AVC em 2020, tornando-se senil. \u00c0 partir desse ponto meu pai ficou mais inseguro e dif\u00edcil de lidar. No in\u00edcio, n\u00e3o parecia nada demais, mas est\u00e1 ocorr\u00eancia provavelmente contribuiu para prejudicar a psiqu\u00ea dele.\n\nAs coisas desandaram de um ano pra c\u00e1. Vejam bem: em 2021 um paciente da minha m\u00e3e come\u00e7ou a dar em cima dela, inclusive mandando-lhe mensagens de conte\u00fado sexual pelo WhatsApp. Minha m\u00e3e diz manteve contato durante o tratamento dele, mas recha\u00e7ou as tentativas de sedu\u00e7\u00e3o e eventualmente bloqueou o contato e apagou as mensagens.\n\n Posteriormente, em junho de 2022, meu pai come\u00e7ou acreditar que minha m\u00e3e tinha um amante, afirmando que um esp\u00edrito supostamente havia lhe contado. Ent\u00e3o ele pediu para ver o telefone dela e, quando viu o tal contato bloqueado e ouviu a explica\u00e7\u00e3o dela, achou que aquilo era uma confirma\u00e7\u00e3o de que ela estaria traindo-o. Meu pai amea\u00e7ou  mandar um hacker pegar as mensagens, mas depois ele disse que apenas encontrou o cara e pediu para ver o celular dele.\n\nEu confesso que nunca vi as mensagens, j\u00e1 que minha m\u00e3e as apagou. Meu pai chegou a dizer-me que ela teria mandado nudes e at\u00e9 v\u00eddeos pornogr\u00e1ficos a ele, mas em outro momento ele mesmo disse que n\u00e3o haviam fotos ou v\u00eddeos no contato. Ele tamb\u00e9m chegou a dizer que o cara tava chantageando ela com os supostos v\u00eddeos pornogr\u00e1ficos, tinha liga\u00e7\u00e3o com pornografia infantil e tr\u00e1fico humano e era bissexual (o que isso importaria?). Por todos esses exageros e contradi\u00e7\u00f5es, prefiro acreditar na vers\u00e3o da minha m\u00e3e.\n\nAp\u00f3s isso, a paran\u00f3ia dele se intensificou: ele come\u00e7ou a acusar minha m\u00e3e de ser amante n\u00e3o s\u00f3 daquele paciente, mas de outros homens. Depois de algumas semanas, as acusa\u00e7\u00f5es passaram a ser di\u00e1rias. Como eu estava passando bastante tempo com minha m\u00e3e, n\u00e3o vejo possibilidade dela ter tido um amante por dia naquelas circunst\u00e2ncias. Meu pai chegou at\u00e9 a arranjar uma arma e amea\u00e7ar matar um dos supostos amantes dela enquanto eles estavam dando uma volta de carro. \n\nAcho que a piora na paran\u00f3ia se deveu ao fato dele ter se ligado a uns m\u00e9diuns de qualidade duvidosa. Primeiramente foi uma cartomante, que confirmou as suspeitas dele que minha m\u00e3e teve \"beijos e car\u00edcias\" com outro homem. Depois foi um suposto vidente, que disse que minha m\u00e3e quase transou com outro cara, mas ele brochou. Por fim, h\u00e1 uma m\u00e3e-de-santo, que virou a guia espiritual preferida dele, e que, embora nunca tenha falado nada contra a minha m\u00e3e na minha frente, desconfio muito, pois a quantidade de dinheiro que ele pagou para ela fazer trabalho n\u00e3o foi pouca.\n\nUma coisa que mantinha o casamento, mesmo nessa situa\u00e7\u00e3o horr\u00edvel, era a minha rela\u00e7\u00e3o com o meu pai. Mesmo que nunca tenha sido um marido perfeito, meu pai sempre foi bom comigo. Ele era presente, carinhoso e me apoiava quando eu precisava. No entanto, nossa rela\u00e7\u00e3o azedou muito devido aos problemas dele com a mam\u00e3e. Por tr\u00eas vezes ele me amea\u00e7ou, falando que, se eu n\u00e3o ficasse do lado dele e fizesse o que ele queria, ele n\u00e3o me trataria mais como filho. Ele tamb\u00e9m voltou a beber e fumar, algo que ele sempre disse que tinha deixado de fazer por minha causa, e insiste que o fato dele ter um filho \"n\u00e3o vai mais atrapalhar a minha felicidade\".\n\nAs acusa\u00e7\u00f5es dele ficaram mais loucas, culminando na pior: ele acusou minha m\u00e3e de estar fazendo macumba contra ele junto ao pai dela (cat\u00f3lico ainda mais ferrenho do que ela). Ele chegou a desejar a morte de meu av\u00f4 na nossa frente (detalhe: meu av\u00f4 tinha recentemente passado por uma cirurgia). A\u00ed, minha m\u00e3e o expulsou de casa. Meu pai a \"retribuiu\" indo \u00e0 casa dos meus av\u00f3s maternos (os mesmos que ele acusou de tentar enfeiti\u00e7\u00e1-lo) e contou a eles \"tudo o que ele sabia\" sobre minha m\u00e3e (ou seja, sobre os supostos amantes dela). Meus av\u00f3s n\u00e3o acreditaram nele (na verdade, eles nunca foram com sua cara). \n\nAp\u00f3s tudo isso, come\u00e7ou o processo de div\u00f3rcio. Felizmente, conseguimos manter o que precisamos e meu pai agora paga uma pens\u00e3o para me ajudar no sustento e estudos. Minha m\u00e3e tamb\u00e9m chegou a denunci\u00e1-lo na Casa da Mulher Brasileira, mas decidiu n\u00e3o iniciar o processo porque n\u00e3o queria passar por mais estresse nesta situa\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nDurante o processo do div\u00f3rcio, minha m\u00e3e chegou at\u00e9 a insistir que eu tentansse manter uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o com meu pai, insistindo que ele me buscasse para sair uma vez por semana. Durante nossos passeios meu pai sempre fingia que nada tinha ocorrido, n\u00e3o queria conversar sobre o assunto e mentia toda vez que outros perguntavam, afirmando que se separou apenas por \"incompatibilidade\". Isso me irritou muito, pois eu detestava ter que manter uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o com ele na base da falsidade, ent\u00e3o disse \u00e0 mam\u00e3e que n\u00e3o queria mais v\u00ea-lo. J\u00e1 faz uns meses que n\u00e3o nos encontramos pessoalmente, e pretendo manter as coisas assim at\u00e9 que ele admita seus erros, procure tratar seu TOC e se desculpe com minha m\u00e3e (mas n\u00e3o volte para ela, pois at\u00e9 eu admito que aquele casamento t\u00e1 melhor destru\u00eddo)."

I am curious about one specific thing: in my language, we use the future subjunctive to indicate things that will happen once a certain condition is fulfilled (\"quando eu for rei, eu serei o melhor governante que esta terra ver\u00e1\" = \"When I am king, I will be the best ruler this land will ever see\"). \n\nI know the romance languages' current future tenses aren't derived from the original latin future tense, but I discovered the indicative future tenses come from fusing the verb in infinitive with the present indicative of *habeo*. However, this doesn't seem to apply to the future subjunctive, and such tense didn't existed in latin, but exists in portuguese. What's it's origin?"

Is Viktor Frankl guilty of the the same sins as Mao Zedong? Were the Jews, en masse, guilty of the same sins as the SS? Why not? They\u2019re the same generation, therefore they must take responsibility for the any evil wrought by their generation, right? It is stupid and ignorant to condemn entire groups of people like that, particularly when it is a group in which people have no say as to whether they belong to it. In that sense, age discrimination is no different from racism and sexism. \n\nDo you blame the Native American Baby Boomers that spent their childhood in residential schools? Surely not, but they are part of that generation that you show such disdain towards. Perhaps it is not an entire generation that is to blame, rather a significant number of individuals within that group who have taken advantage of their circumstances to varying degrees. You are thinking about the problem in the most simplistic manner you can, just blaming an entire generation. That makes you, as an individual, a bigot.

Here's why:\n\n\\- The reason why Jeff let Annie go and never held her back is that he truly loved her. When Jeff was imagining he and Annie living together, he realized that he simply does not know what Annie truly wants, and as such he should let her go. It shows growth since Jeff has always been the self-centred, ego-centric one in the group, to tank a heartbreak and allow Annie to live the life she wanted, prove that finally Jeff has completed his character arc. It is also a recall to Britta's quote earlier in the series: \"I believe that if you love someone you should let them go, if they never return then they're never yours to begin with\" (which is actually a reference to Indecent Proposal).\n\n\\- Annie never truly knows whether Jeff loves her or just playing with her (like he had done with so many other women), like just think about it, most of what we see on the screen that points toward Jeff loving Annie is all happening inside Jeff's head (his visions, dreams, hallucinations, etc...), Annie did pick up the hint here and there, but it was never **certain**, in a span of 6 years together they kissed each other thrice, yes thrice, and the third kiss is like 5 years away from the second one (with the first one so obviously taken for the team with absolutely no joy and pleasure whatsoever), so it makes sense that she is still putting on her guard and not being overly emotional with him in the final episode. When Jeff was pitching his season 7 in the bar, Annie seems reluctant to accept that since she didn't know for sure that Jeff is loving her, that third kiss and the confession were how Annie knows for sure that Jeff loves her, and after that, when Jeff was telling the group about how he and Annie were saying goodbye to the table, Annie said \"For season 6, season 7, who knows, it's out of hand, too many variables ;)\" with the coyest smile ever, which meant that she kinda changed her mind. So ... rest assured guys, she's coming back :))).\n\n\\- Also I refuse to believe anything else other than that."

The USSR tried to remove religion, culture and even language to some extent. Some of it was done through force, but most of it was more through influence and implemented gradually - and it worked in the cities. With that being said, they did kill people who would rise against them. Because of that, I don\u2019t think there are any Hazaras that are completely pro USSR. However, I think we have a more open minded attitude towards them than other ethnic groups. Perhaps because of the equality and education they brought. A good portion of the Hazaras in the cities actually fought for the government against the mujahideen - and the government was communist. But I think a greater portion was with Hezb e Wahdat, who lost a lot of followers after some vengeful hazara soldiers decided to attack Pashtun civilians, unfortunately. The leader, Mazari, apologized for this. Then he was killed. I believe Mazari was a good man, but his army was not always god fearing.  \n\nIt\u2019s a fact that USSR brought wealth and infrastructure to the country, more specifically the biggest cities. They didn\u2019t get to spread outside the cities. The attack lead by the different mujihedeen definitely ruined the infrastructure and economy. Had we not gone through all of that, I\u2019m pretty sure our country would be safer and under control from terrorist attacks that were mainly lead by USA-backed terrorist groups - like other Central Asian countries that were under the control of USSR. But we would also have lost a good portion of our culture and religion.",

I have a HSA attached to the plan that I fund for $7000/year that I pay medical bills until I hit the coverage limits (HSA can also cover medical costs once I retire, so the extra is long term savings). I also have Long Term disability that pays 75% of my salary for any long term care. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that, I have 3 vehicles being insured, and the PIP (Personal Injury Protection) coverage for them comes out to about $1050 per 6 months. It's the unlimited PIP as I haven't changed coverage since the reform took place last summer, although it does state on my policies that it's coordinated with my medical coverage. But it only lists a benefit from coordination of $269. I'm not sure what I'm getting for that outlay of cash. My understanding is that in other states that do not have no fault, that this PIP coverage does not exist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what benefit am I getting from keeping PIP? An extra 10% of my salary for long term disability? Waiving my out-of-pocket co-pay?

My landlord has come back and is claiming that there is excessive items that had to happen to clean the place after I moved out. Some cleaning, I can understand, except that I paid a $375 cleaning charge when I moved in - not sure how I'm getting double-dipped on that charge.\n\nThe real issue is his claim of needing to paint the entire house. Prior to my moving in, there was only one room that was painted - one bedroom that was purple. There was normal wear and tear on walls that existed when I moved in, but my timing was tight, so no other painting was done prior to moving in. My understanding is that painting is considered a normal wear-and-tear type of item that is part of the landlords costs - is this accurate?\n\nNow 2 years and 2 months later, He is attempting to charge me $2500 for painting the entire 1700 square foot house, plus $225 for paint. This is high since I had my previous 2500 square foot home painted for $1500 \\~2 years ago, prior to selling it. This is in addition to an additional $400 cleaning charge, $175 for carpet cleaning, and some additional miscellaneous items. The net effect is that instead of receiving a large chunk of my $2550 security deposit back, he is claiming that I owe him $925 additional.\n\nWhat options do I have here? Am I in the right that painting of a house is typically a landlord expense?  \nI intend to dispute the charges with him as they are ridiculously high, but is this going to require my taking him to court?"

                "body": "So I recently moved out of a house I was renting after I bought a new house. My landlord has come back and is claiming that there is excessive items that had to happen to clean the place after I moved out.  Some cleaning, I can understand, except that I paid a $375 cleaning charge when I moved in - not sure how I'm getting double-dipped on that charge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe real issue is his claim of needing to paint the entire house. Prior to my moving in, there was only one room that was painted - one bedroom that was purple. There was normal wear and tear on walls that existed when I moved in, but my timing was tight, so no other painting was done prior to moving in. My understanding is that painting is considered a normal wear-and-tear type of item that is part of the landlords costs - is this accurate?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow 2 years and 2 months later, He is attempting to charge me $2500 for painting the entire 1700 square foot house, plus $225 for paint. This is high since I had my previous 2500 square foot home painted for $1500 2 years ago prior to selling it. This is in addition to an additional $400 cleaning charge, $175 for carpet cleaning, and some additional miscellaneous items.  The net effect is that instead of receiving a large chunk of my $2550 security deposit back, he is claiming that I owe him $925 additional.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat options do I have here? Am I in the right that painting of a house is typically a landlord expense?   \n I intend to dispute the charges with him as they are ridiculously high, but is this going to require my taking him to court?"

As in it has stopped remembering which zoom level I was previously using and likes to zoom out to the entire metro region. When I let it autozoom, it will change based on speed, but won't allow me to determine that I want it zoomed further out or in once my speed has changed one of the thresholds a single time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) The text size is inconsistent. I'd love it to show everything in small text, all the time. However, every other time I start Waze in CarPlay, I get text that is extremely large font, along with icons and everything in large font. This does not resize as I go faster and the autozoom kicks in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) No integration with the split screen. I figure this is probably more Apple than Waze, but the split screen does show whats playing on Spotify, so maybe it is Waze...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first 2 seemed to work fine a few months ago.

It can still look great even though you break some \"rules\", just like with soft classic outfits (and experimenting is always fun), but someone dressed in their best colours *and* lines is just chef's kiss.   \n\nThere are several grays in the bright winter palette, but ofc that doesn't mean they're going to be the best choice for *every* bright winter.

So many fun looks \\^\\^\n\nHere's a few \"problems\" we seem to have in common:\n\nSlide 1: The first thing I notice is actually that little piece of hair sticking up in some of the pictures. Such a small thing, yet it can distract so much - even more so when the outfit itself looks very polished/classic. (I like to use clear eyebrow mascara as a quick and easy way to tame any flyaways).\n\nIn the second pic, the creases in the white trousers immediately drag everything down.Pic 3 has a lovely outline, and pic 4 looks absolutely smashing on you, not at all boring.\n\nSlide 2: The high waisted trousers (while still looking kinda cute) swallow you whole. The pleats are too big, and there is just too much happening in the upper waist area. I really fell for that style a couple of years ago, so I ordered a pair, only to discover it looked exactly like it does on you, not like it did on the model (hmph). I got some scissors and cut the  part above the belt loops off to see if that would help. It did, but the pleats at the front were still too much and made me look like I had a pudgy belly in profile view.\n\nSlide 3: The white skirt in the middle is great! Would look lovely combined with a soft, loose (but not bulky or oversize) knit sweater. \n\nPic 4 isn't horrible, but it does come across as kind of matronly, and the pattern is a bit too small/busy. Belts are very hit or miss. Often I feel like they can make me look wider than i really am.\n\nSlide 4: Now this is where we get into one of my main problems... In the 2nd pic, the dress makes you look wider than you are, despite the tight, elasticated waist **and** being a black dress. I think it's too loose and baggy all over, and then too tight in the waist area, making the fabric stick out in weird areas. It's usually better to have something that follows the lines of your body, in a gentle, non clingy way. Pic 3 and 4 are what I like to call \"OK. I guess I'm a ball now\"-looks. Not having visually strong shoulders, combined with the straighter and looser shape of the blazer/cardigan, makes it look like your middle is the widest point on the body (which is clearly not the case, looking at the other pics).\n\nFinal thoughts: I think your dark hair makes it easier for you to get away with contrasts (especially in the more classy outfits), but I'm wondering if it might look even better if you combine something like mid wash jeans with a white shirt, Dark gray sweater and stockings with a medium or light gray skirt, a mauve knitted sweater with dark gray tapered trousers, etc. 90% of the time *some* contrast will look better than full on white or full on black outfits.",

                "body": "1: the first step towards having a flattering wardrobe is to figure out your colour season and follow those shade recommendations (unless you naturally have great eye for that). So many people wear colours that wash them out, and that will ruin an otherwise perfect outfit. If more formal/conservative clothes are required, think about whether greyish white and charcoal grey might be better options than black and white. Maybe you're a bit warmer and more muted, so cream and deep taupe are your colours. It doesn't have to be 100% perfect, but there's a huge difference between colours that don't do that much for you and colours that wash you out/make you look sickly. \n\n2: The basic items are the most important part of my wardrobe, as I can combine them, throw on some sneakers and be out the door in no time. Or I can combine basic jeans with a more interesting top, put on some heels and a necklace to look a bit more done up. I have flattering jeans, mainly slim fit or straight fit, in different shades of blue and grey. Personally I like to have at least two of each colour category, so I always have one ready to wear. Well fitting tops, t-shirts and sweaters - not super tight, but gently following my curves. Some in neutral colours, some in more fun colours - all from the palette that best suits my natural colouring, which means they're quite easy to combine.\n\nI have 3 casual smart pants in light grey, dark grey and navy, 2 greyish white shirts and 2 blazers. If you need to wear smart clothes for work, obviously invest more into this category :P\n\nWhen it comes to dresses I have the standard black (dark grey in my case) knee-length one that works for both funerals and formal occasions - the one I can just throw on without having to put any thought into my outfit. I also have a few long sleeved winter dresses in wool, and a lot of summer dresses. Most of my clothes don't have patterns on them, but a lot of the summer dresses do. I prefer more quiet patterns in a small-medium size with lots of \"air\" between. Paisley is always a winner. For shorts and skirts, it's like with the pants - a few casual ones, a few smarter ones. I can wear shorter (within reason) shorts, but skirts and dresses generally looks better when they're either slightly above or slightly below the knee. It looks unbalanced if they're too short. \n\nFor SC it really doesn't take much to look unkempt, so cut off any loose threads, sew any dangly buttons properly on, say goodbye to garments that have lint balls on them (or shave off if possible). Also consider dying items that look washed out, but are otherwise in good condition. Keep your shoes and sneakers clean! Dirty shoes do not look cute and edgy on us ;)\n\n3: Invest in outerwear. Especially during winter, that is pretty much your whole outfit when you venture outside. I have to wear a winter coat for 5-6 months of the year, and while comfort and functionality is priority #1, I still try to tweak it to be as flattering as possible. My thick insulated parka with a giant hood isn't exactly a fashion statement, but I bought it in a colour that looks good on me, and it has drawstrings so it still looks like I have a waist in it. For more smart looking options I have 3 wool coats in different colours. One is black, since I bought it long before I found out black washes me out, but hey, works for funerals. One is red, and while the colour looks fine on me it doesn't really match the rest of my wardrobe that well. The third one is a beautiful, more feminine coat with intricate geometrical patterns. Not great for SC in theory, but it works because it's light grey on medium grey, so it doesn't stand out as much. Sadly this is also the most open/least warm of all the coats.\n\nFor spring and summer I have something similar to a college jacket (but more fitted) in dark grey with medium grey arms. This is for very casual days. Then there's my soft, chinois green (fake)leather jacket. This is my version of a pop of colour, and it goes great with my neutral grey basics. Technically it's not the best option for SC, as it's not that rounded, and it has an asymmetrical zipper, but it still works great for me as long as the rest of the outfit is in my correct lines. It's absolutely OK to break the \"rules\" every now and then. If it works it works :) \n\nWhat I really feel  I'm missing in my summer wardrobe is a lightweight parka on the slightly more feminine side. I have such a hard time finding jackets and coats that look good on me. The cut I want just isn't in style, or if I do find something close to what I want, it's in black or beige (both look awful on me). Somehow those very sharp and straight-looking trenchcoats, and the soft and flowy belted jackets that can work great for SNs because they have the frame to carry it, always seems to be readily available everywhere. Not fair! Coats and casual shoes that are simultaneously comfy and good-looking are the things I struggle the most with finding as a SC.\n\n4: Comfort and fit. It doesn't matter how good the clothes look if they don't *feel* good. Don't buy those jeans that make your legs look great if you at the same time have to walk around wondering if your buttcrack is showing. Don't buy those \"well I guess this could work?\"-items - they will end up in the back of your closet. You don't have to spend a fortune on the perfect clothes, but I have found that it pays off to invest a bit more, especially for basic items. A 30$ top that lasts you 5 years is cheaper than a 10$ top that twists and pills after the first wash. Make sure to buy the correct length when shopping for jeans/pants, or have them hemmed. Same goes for the length of the sleeves. Some types look very cute in slightly oversized garments, we generally just look messy in that.\n\nOh, and when you find something you *really* like, go back to stock up. I know it's not very exciting to go back and buy another grey tank top, just like the one you already have at home, but you will miss it greatly when your favourite tank top falls apart, and they discontinued that colour/type.

It was so bad that the ai formed Germany and got the revolution. It took quality, offensive, and quantity ideas, cucking them out of their alliance with Scandinavia, an alliance with Britain, and a bit of savescumming to finally bring them down to size. At the very end, they even got the PU on Scandinavia because they had the same dynasty, at least until I bitch slapped them one last time in the ensuing succession war",

Growing up and observing others, movies, media and sm posts and their ramblings about \"love\" and \"crushes\", always knew there was something inherently wrong with me. Couldn't pin point, because up until now, I have never had a \"crush\" in the regular sense, though I have had strong feelings that are incredibly rare, towards some women (The last I had was nearly 7 - 8 years ago. Never had anything after thar). \n\nNever been in a relationship till now (Mostly because the thought of being in one never appealed to me at all, and couldn't get why people badly want to be in one). I'll be honest, sometimes I have considered the idea(r) of a relationship just to fuel a narcissistic desire, keeping up with the Joneses sort of thing, but apart from that, it doesn't go any deeper.\n\nComing to having sex and sexual desires, I definitely have sexual desires towards women, the only question here is how much which varies. But I really just view having sex just as I would view drinking alcohol, doing drugs, going bungee jumping etc. Only for the momentary high, until I nut. Nothing more than that \n\nIts only 3 days back I discovered aromanticism when trying to learn a little bit more about the pride month. The evidence too adds up bloody well. No relationship, no crushes and my playlist is filled with all kinds of rock, ranging from soft rock to heavy metal, and in about 95% of it, the lyrics have absolutely nothing to do with love (Though I would definitely enjoy a well constructed rock song describing love, like \"Forever\" by Kiss or \"Long long way to go\" by Def Leppard or \"Love's a loaded gun\" by Alice Cooper). I generally hate pop songs because 95% of them just keep singing about falling in love, or other inane things that I simply cannot relate to, apart from other reasons too.\n\nBut I won't deny, I have experienced bad feelings of loneliness. But I also won't deny that I have felt like an android when it comes to relationships, non existent feelings.\n\nSo, experienced aromantics, am I aromantic or not? This could quite literally change the way I relate to \"love\" and \"finding a partner\" and things like that."

Self assessment, valuated by the managers and BU heads\n\n2. A 20 minute video recorded teams interview, based solely on how you answer 6 - 10 questions designed by the PnL team, conducted by someone from HR. Yes, the interview was only for 20 minutes and this would then be sent to the panel members to review (Don't ask me how someone could judge the entire worth of a person in just 20 minutes, I thought it was silly). The questions weren't going to get revealed and you'd only get to know when the interview was happening\n\nYour promotion was guaranteed only when both the BU heads and panel members gave the green signal. If even one of them rejected (called a \"conflict\"), then you were re - interviewed in Jan 2021, failing which you would be kicked out of the company. If rejections happen from both sides, you would be reassessed in July '21, failing which you would be kicked out of the company. \n\nI know that this process is only a slight improvement from what 2016s had to experience, where they were all kept in the dark, until one day, they got a mail from HR out of the blue, saying that they were getting let go. All because they didn't fulfill a silly criteria that they wouldn't even be made aware of, to get promoted. \n\nI have seen a lot of posts regarding the work, work culture etc. However no one really talks about the dark side of AL promotions, and the fact that if you weren't getting promoted on time, you were getting kicked out. \n\nMy opinion on the whole assessment process for the 2017s is that it was a disaster of epic proportions, especially since the number of 2017s who were still left in the company by Dec 2020 was extremely low to begin with and pulling some 80 odd 2016 ALs out of delivery did not help their case. \n\nThe reasoning given by management for the 2017 promotion process was \"Since 2016s weren't in delivery, the expectations on 2017s to lead and perform was extremely high\". This soon led to 2017 ALs being overworked by leading 2 accounts with no backing from 2016s whatsoever, as well as 2018s becoming something like \"acting AL\", for accounts with no 2017s.\n\nEx - employee here and I don't know what shit - show they're planning in the name of promoting 2018s, but I'd love to know your thoughts and stories!"

I wanted to play her for a long time, and with the recent buffs, now seems better than ever. \n\nThe main problem for me is that I usually get a few early kills, stack up my dark seal, etc. But post-laning phase I feel useless, everyone groups up and my team loses every teamfight so I can\u2019t be the cleanup crew. \n\nEven when I get lots of kills and my team wins fights, I feel like I can never close out games on her. Like I\u2019ll have a full mejais and we win all the fights but we have no towers. It\u2019s been more than a few times this happens so I know I\u2019m doing something wrong. And I always feel like eventually the game gets to a point where I can\u2019t even 1v1 anyone anymore and I\u2019m useless without ult. Any and all tips are greatly appreciated bc I really want to get better on her. \n\nHere\u2019s my [op.gg](https://na.op.gg/summoners/na/horrorteens) for anyone curious."

It look like steel ball what was shot by vast variety of calibers. But were they from space or pulled from earth? \n\nWhy does few of lost ancient civilizations got destroyed after flooding that happened over days then next one appeared after it got frozen again on the poles or the poles were just moved shifting all the water and ice? Why does the moon posses such capability?\n\nHow was all the info from ancient civilizations saved from the floodings? Some of it was carved to stone but there were too many for the temples. Perhaps it was saved by a alien space ship that gave all the info back to their newly planted civilizations. After all gods come from the sky and they spreaded wisdom usually. Maybe even saved few humans from the old one and thus mixed races were born but i believe each of them were continent related and planted at different times.\n\nThose answers i seek are hidden under Sphinx and many other ancient buildings that i will never see.\n\nMaybe the aliens just want to harvest water from Earth like they did on Mars or play gods, whatever it is maybe the civilizations were killed because they knew too much. In many ancients books knowledge and free will posses dangerous power. After all its one of the few differences between being human and being god. No wonder it is heavily suppressed nowadays.\n\nI and many others feel like this civilization is lost, far beyond possible repair point. So if aliens are on Reddit, reading this. I know one representative called>! Elon Musk !<that is on this app for sure. I think it wouldnt bother the free thinkers if yall resetted our soon."

I don\u2019t think JKR intended for Hermione to be black when she wrote her, but interpretation of a story is up to the reader. So when the developers* of The Cursed Child decided Hermione was black, and people got all racist about it, JKR confirmed a black Hermione was a legitimate interpretation based on info she provided in the books.\n\n*I say \u201cdevelopers\u201d because that decision could have been made during writing, casting, or one of the other stages of development that I don\u2019t know about.",

He LOVES having people over, and has tried to get involved by making awesome drinks for everyone, but once we get into the game he unfortunately gets ignored. (Edit: To clarify, he\u2019s not been playing with my Friday folks. He\u2019ll just hang out and would like to be more involved.) \n\nNow I\u2019m starting a Sunday game with another group, and he\u2019s decided to give it another shot. He wants to have fun with the people and not feel left out.\n\nWhen I asked him why he doesn\u2019t like it, he said he\u2019s always loved board games and puzzles (he loves when we play Lords of Waterdeep) but it\u2019s the open-ended aspects of D&D. Basically, rules don\u2019t have to be consistently applied. And he won\u2019t say it outright, but I don\u2019t think he digs the role play aspects either. Like I think he WANTS to be good at/enjoy role play, but its not a strength. \n\nI suggested he really study up on the 5e rules and be our rules lawyer. We\u2019re going to rotate DMs, and no one DMing is super loose with rules. But I think he\u2019s generally discouraged about playing, so that doesn\u2019t interest him\u2026. I think particularly because he\u2019s aware that the rules potentially don\u2019t matter depending on what the DM wants. \n\nAny suggestions to make it more fun for him? I\u2019m not DMing, but our DMs are generally open to discuss things and want him to have fun. \n\nAbout 2 years ago for a one shot, I made him a slutty half elf bard, hoping he\u2019d get into the role play aspect because he likes being silly and flirty. He didn\u2019t. So this time he decided he should try a ranger. Rangers are fairly simple for a semi-beginner player, and the skills aren\u2019t as role play based as a bard\u2019s skills are."

And no, I'm not talking about the minor \"grinding your teeth\", although I do suffer from that as well. What I am dismissing is the more \"excessively flapping your hands while making the most questionable of noises and facial expressions, in a similar fashion to a demon possession in some exorcist horror film. The stimming also causes me to lose my consciousness (or consequence) so that I'm so trapped in my schizophrenic-like daydreams that I'm at risk of losing my own life (let's say when I'm crossing the road, or driving). This issue also causes me to be distracted from my lectures at university, and there trigger fort this could literally be anything, as it is all governed by my mind, which I can't control."

Hard as a rock and has been sitting there for at least a week probably. My poop always finds a way to get stuck in there. I was hoping the laxatives would soften everything, but the opposite happened. My stools aren\u2019t getting soft at all. I feel like the only thing that might work is an enema.\n\nDo laxatives and remedies stop working when the poop reaches a certain age? Because I feel like my poop is too old to get decimated by a laxative. Or maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s been impacting my asshole. One day my poop is going to turn into cement and rot into a deadly bacteria.\n\nI thought I wasn\u2019t pooping because I wasn\u2019t eating enough. But now that I\u2019ve been eating so much, I feel like that feeds the impacted stool. I should stop eating before my colon explodes and I start puking shit.\n\nI miss pooping every 3 days. That\u2019s what I consider normal for myself. I was so good with that until a few months ago. Everything that used to work for me no longer works, and I\u2019m considering seeing a doctor about it."

She\u2019s been through this many times before. But this is odd even for me. 3 days is my average. 4-5 days, not big of a deal. 6 or more is when I start to worry that something isn\u2019t right. Even on my period, this isn\u2019t normal.\n\nI know it\u2019s not an intestinal blockage, because if it was, I\u2019d be in agony. I am not feeling uncomfortable - I guess that\u2019s a good sign that my body is working normally. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be so jealous of people with normal shit schedules!\n\nI feel like my colon is dead. I tried a lot of stuff that usually works for me. Like laxatives, Taco Bell, water, fiber supplements, fruit, and popcorn. I sometimes feel like getting it out, but it is stuck in there. I don\u2019t want to strain because it\u2019ll give me a headache. And yet I keep eating like normal. Maybe it\u2019s weirdly shaped or a pile.\n\nI guess now is the time to eat more greens, drink more water, get more exercise, and take stronger laxatives. Maybe now is the time I finally try the Milk of Magnesium. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve needed the enema. I know I shouldn\u2019t be, but I\u2019m frustrated and desperate at this point. I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s something more serious - something that might kill me in the future.\n\nMy mom says I shouldn\u2019t obsess over it and that would make it worse, but now I lay in bed crying out of fear.

Anybody who\u2019s seen Classic Who knows how much the Fourth Doctor gets knocked unconscious. It seems to happen twice in every serial in his early seasons. In the 70s, it was a cheap way to get the character out of action. But this dude is like Tintin. Or Ian during One\u2019s run. I\u2019m actually impressed. In \u201cThe Sontaran Experiment\u201d (where Tom famously broke his collarbone), he gets knocked out THRICE in a two-parter!\n\nHas anyone actually kept track on how much each Doctor has been knocked out, or is that too difficult of a task? \n\nI feel like Four would have the most, and it\u2019s not because he had the longest run. Because like I said before, it happens more frequently during the first half of his run. So if his run lasted as long as say, Pertwee\u2019s, he\u2019d still win the Tintin award.\n\nSure Three has had his fair share of comas, but he seems harder to knock down. He\u2019s more likely to knock someone else down or himself down with one of his 10 minute healing comas. It only takes a simple bump on the head for Four to be down for the count.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m only really interested in the Third and Fourth Doctors. This means I\u2019ll only contribute on the data regarding those two if I have the time.\n\nPeople have made lists of Sam and Dean\u2019s knockouts in Supernatural, so I know it\u2019s not impossible."

Sacrificial. Expendable fodder for the needless slaughter of humanity. \n\nYet, we perpetually hang on to the hope that if we stay true to ourselves and our principles, we maintain the ability to be the one that makes the difference. \nA noble persuit.\n\nHang in there!

And, even if things did not go as planned, you followed through. \nYour actions matched your words. \nYour heart was in the right place. \n\nNothing feels better than to see the results to know that perhaps we did influence and encourage a positive difference. \n\nThat one success amidst a sea of disappointment makes it all worth the pain, frustration, and self-percieved failure. \n\nWe exist for that moment of seeing somebody begin the process of seeking, and perhaps eventually discovering release from their own emotional shackles.\n\nSome things are beyond our ability to influence in positive ways. Some people simply do not wish to be helped. Resist the temptation to be drawn into the denial and pretentiousness of it all. \n\nAs empaths, rather than accept, we often overly invest in a fantasy.

A lot. \nKnow when to say.. enough!\n\nA friendly reminder to be as kind, as forgiving, as patient -- and nurturing -- to yourself as you are to those around you! \n\nAfter all, if we don't stay mentally and emotionally healthy, we lose our defining sense of purpose -- the gift that comes in our unique ability to be there for others. Our perspective is our gift to humanity.\n\nEncourage balance by allowing for mental space to let the positive emotions and experiences in as well! Yes.. even if you have to disengage from the situation to actively seek those inspirations for yourself! Recharge your proverbial batteries!\n\nSelf-care is not selfish. Maintain the self-awareness to resist allowing anybody to turn that reality against you. :)\n\nEmpaths are amazing people. \nDon't think so?

When I get in the zone of something I really enjoy everything feels speedy and clear. Is that what everyday is like for everyone else?\n\n*I have to add more text, skip if you like. For example, if I\u2019m in a class and the teacher starts talking about Ancient Greece, I can easily follow along, and score well on the quiz without studying\u2014 assuming I\u2019m not sleep deprived and the quiz is about the gods and not memorizing locations or something . But when I was in high school algebra, it hurt to pay attention. I would constantly be listening to songs in my head or unrelated thoughts or talking with my friend or laughing at the teacher and messing around. Sometimes I would write stupid shit in my workbook as a joke , like an idea that isn\u2019t really an idea. For example: Instead of pancakes,I would just write \u201cSkilletcakes?\u201d Or \u201cfriendplanes?\u201d Just things I thought were funny. I just couldn\u2019t force myself to listen.

Let's not forget about listening, listening to God through prayer.\n\nWe shouldn't just read the Bible, we need to contemplate and practice the main message. Not pick and choose what we want to live by and submit others to our will. God makes it clear, He gave us free will and waits for us to invite Him into our lives.  \n\nLearning is a life long event, if people think they read the Bible once or go to mass every Sunday makes them less of a sinner, then they need a wake up call. \n\nIf you need a lesson on boundaries, you might want to consult a therapist, priest, and pray about this. It is really worrisome that someone has trouble setting boundaries and respecting others boundaries.\n\nI grew up in a very traumatic stoic home, I learned about boundaries by reading the Bible and other books as a kid and paying attention in Church.\n\nI mean there are even shows you can watch from the 90s. Let's go back to the WWJD moment.\n\nIsn't Jesus is the example we are to follow? He spoke to the Prostitute and the Woman at the Well, did he leave them to die or did he save them? \n\nBe more like Jesus, spread love and hope.",

Thou shall not kill. Obviously, you shouldn't murder people, but you also shouldn't murder people emotionally and/or their character.\n\nReading the Bible helps too.",

Teach your boys to treat women with respect and resist temptation so we don't continue to have this discussion.\n\nFinally, trust is really important in a relationship and marriage.

For a mortgage you take the interest percentage divided by 12 and multiply that by the outstanding balance to figure out the dollar amount of interest in the first month's payment. As the mortgage approaches maturity the interest payment reduces proportionally to the amount of the principal loan balance is left. So the first mortgage payment is like 87% interest and the last mortgage payment is less than 1% interest.",

Right now we\u2019re living in the consequences of the covid stimulus bill that basically did exactly what this post suggests would help people the most, give nearly everyone in the country a stipend for existing that can be spent on whatever they want.\n\nThe issue with doing this as others have stated is you can\u2019t magically increase the supply of food or other necessary goods, so when all these people receive this extra money, the demand for all these things goes up without anybody producing more stuff which creates shortages. Compound that with the fact stuff wasn\u2019t being made or sent where it was needed and you get basic things costing 2-3 times more than they did even just two years ago (eggs went from $1.29 for a dozen large where I live right before covid to $3.99 last weekend). How does this help people when in order to keep up with demand you effectively price everyone who needs something out of the market?\n\nAlso, the idea that a lot of these people who aren\u2019t being productive in any sense of the word now will magically become productive if their basic needs are met is laughable at best. What makes most of producers productive are the qualities of discipline, inner motivation, and the desire for delayed gratification. You don\u2019t suddenly see 16% or more of the lowest income earners instantly start doing more productive things with their time if you take away the only motivational force in their life, survival.",

We only get a taste of this at the beginning of the next episode, but what if there's actually a new series on interdimensional cable where this plays out in a much longer form?\n\nThen in Rickmurai Jack at 6:28 he says they're \"hitting the ground running with a Citadel episode.\" Obviously we're supposed to believe this is just regular fourth wall breaking similar to a franchise like Deadpool, but what if we're not the only intended audience for that joke?\n\nI do realize this is similar to a [previous idea that's been theorized](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/gy57cj/rick_and_morty_the_characters_break_the_fourth/) earlier on Reddit where they're self-aware of the show by seeing it on interdimensional cable so they can reference the show, but I'd like to say my take on this theory makes the distinction of them knowing it's a show because they're working on it behind the scenes instead of merely as onlookers who just happened to discover they were being recorded and saw the resulting footage."

Should I have tasting notes printed out or on my phone in case they can\u2019t come up with reference sensory experiences? What should I do if someone can\u2019t pick up on the subtle hints of flavor or smell? Should I have snacks that pair well with each or whiskey in general, or should that wait until after the tasting is over? What about cocktail recipes and ingredients for people who don\u2019t like their whiskey neat or on the rocks (also for after the tasting)? What do I do with the leftovers, give each person a bottle? What do I do if one of them really isn\u2019t a big hit with anyone (the least of my worries since it\u2019s a pretty open-minded group and the groom sounds like he might enjoy Caol Ila)?\n\nBasically, how should I go about managing this so I actually look like I know what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019ve drank whiskey but I\u2019m far from an expert and this is primarily for the groom-to-be since whiskey seems to be his favorite spirit but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s fully experienced the whiskey spectrum himself.\n\nI\u2019m not super worried because I can always talk this over with my friend that\u2019s going and is originally from Kentucky, so he has a lot of experience with at least bourbon. This is also about three weeks away, so I\u2019m sure I could come up with some ideas on my own in that time.\n\nAny and all input is greatly appreciated!"

My day is now ruined. Her presence alone gives me extreme fear. The other staff were asking what was wrong and didn't understand that I am creeped out by the impression and prediction that something bad is going to happen rather than something bad actually happening. They still sympathised and claimed to protect me from that one member of staff but I didn't really believe them. She could still catch me when I happened to be alone and yell at me or whatever but get away with it because there's no one else around. I am so terrified of that one member of staff that every day I ask which staff will be working in the next following days and make notes on my calendar on which days she is in so I can find trends and be prepared."

Whether you are new to Minecraft or play since alpha.We have two worlds, both being shaped by the players.\nWe have a very social community with a [forum](http://www.supgaming.com), a [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/groups/136628763082001/) and a [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/StraightUpParadise)\n\n\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n[Screenshots here. You'll love them!](http://imgur.com/a/mPkey)\n\n\n**Videos**\n\n[Flitwick cinematic video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBtIAPo7hVA&lc)\n\n\n**Rules**\n\nOf course we have rules. It's to keep the server a happy place. They're all quite common and are very easy to follow with a little bit of common sense.\n\n* Do not grief. [We consider griefing as a serious offence. This is our main rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer)\n* Do not steal.\n* Bug abusing of any kind is not allowed. If you find a bug, use /helpop to report about it in-game!\n* If you're about to claim a huge area, always consult with a staff member in-game and make sure that it's alright before.\n* Do not spam or misbehave in the chat\n* Do not use any type of cheats. A cheat would be a client-mod that allows you to have a higher advantage over other players. (minimap is allowed though, but we prefer you to use [our live map](http://minecraft.supgaming.com:8123))\n* Do not make huge farms but consult with a staff-member before.\n* Only english allowed in the global chat. Use the private messages for chatting in another language.\n* No advertising about other communities.\n* Respect the staff team.\n* Do NOT misuse the economysystem. An example of misuse would be to stand AFK for a whole day in your auto-harvester and go sell it in the store. Basically you need to work for your money, that's how it works in real life, and that's how it should be in game.\n* Try your best to make your builds seem realistic. No floating bridges. Also put some effort in your builds and try to make the general look of the world nice. \n* If you need assistance you must use /report or /helpop. If you ask for help in the global chat you will be kicked, muted or even jailed. If this is continued further action will be taken.\n* Respect your fellow players. Example: do not swear at them or insult them. Do not mess with them while they are AFK, etc etc.\n\n\n**Server info**\n\n* A stable Linux-based with 8GB RAM, located in Germany. (Dedicated)\n* Latest Bukkit is being used and we're extremely happy about how good it works.\n* 80 playerslots.\n* 100/100 Mbit connection.\n* We are always trying to keep our server up to date and suggestions are always welcomed on our forums!\n* We have a working Economy System with shops near the spawn location.\n* We have friendly, helpful and active members\n* We have an experienced and mature staff\n* [Check out our Dynamic Map for a taste of our world](http://minecraft.supgaming.com:8123)\n* [Also check out our screenshots for a smell of our world](http://imgur.com/a/mPkey)\n* We all survive together, we create towns and villages!\n* We even have a community created Texture Pack!\n\n\n**About our plugins**\n\n* We do use the plugin called \"Essentials\" to it's full potential. There's alot of useful commands for both players, moderators, and OP's.\n* LWC - Lock system for doors, chests, dispensers, furnaces.\n* LogBlock - Advanced Anti-griefing system.\n* MagicCarpet - Roam around on a magic carpet in the air (Staff and donator only)\n* Multiple world-system\n* Daytime is 16 minutes, nighttime is 3 minutes. Sunset and sunrise equals to 1 minute so the whole cycle is exactly 20 minutes.\n* World backups every hour\n* Borderguard.\n* Worldedit and Worldguard.\n* A lot of useful administrative plugins.\n\n**SEE YOU INGAME!**\n\n*You won't survive alone!*\n"

For a bit of backstory, the year before last year I had no friends in school whatsoever so when I met Katie and Emily and they showed some interest in being friends I became friends with them. and convinced myself they was my only option for friends. \n     I had gotten Katie's number and she moved away later that year. Katie was always super clingy over text and CONSTANTLY texting even when I left her on read for weeks at a time. She's not funny at all, she supports the opposite political party than me and talks abt it all the time, 9 times out of 10 I'll come back from school with over 30 notifs from her, I'm not even exaggerating. But I'd feel bad abt cutting her off because she's autistic so a lot of these things have her autism to blame. \n     As for the other friend, emily, she started trauma dumping without asking almost every week talking abt how she wanted to d*e and how she almost committed. I felt extremely uncomfortable every time but I didn't say anything and tried my best to comfort her , even tho I was doing Avery bad job. \n     Also later when I came out to her as trans, she was supportive, but was constantly \"jokingly\" trying to out me to the whole class by using he/him on me when I specifically told her not to in front of everybody, and using my new preferred name. She went so far and kept doing it enough that she did actually out me to one person, who luckily was supportive, but I still didn't want it to happen. \n     When it kept happening and happening and I couldn't just came to a breaking point I started crying in the middle of class and told her that what she did was super fucked up, and she turned that into HER venting and saying she's a terrible person and I shouldn't even be her friend and she doesn't deserve it. I didn't want to make her feel bad abt it bc I knew she was struggling, but now I realize that she was kinda toxic almost a year later and I feel like it would be weird if I brought it up again now to cut contact with her. How do I cut them both off?"

My crush in 5th grade felt way different than the previous one but maybe it's just cuz it was a bigger crush. Also, I think in my head I could like boys if I found the right boy.

I also despise paying travel costs, and therefore do not travel often at all.\n\nI love my work but I've never made more than 35k in a year, but I've never needed more than 15-25k/yr to fund my lifestyle.  I've never had a car payment, I've never taken out a loan (other than to buy property when I was in my 20s), and I've never used a credit card.  I'm simply not willing to pay interest.  I also cut my own hair, build/fix everything myself, and ultimately try very hard to never incur unnecessary costs.  To \"splurge\" really hurts me, and I feel an actual recovery period, both financially and psychologically.  I'm the quintessential \"tightwad,\" and I make no apologies because I've never been broke, but as I grow more comfortable in my position I am willing to loosen up in order to enrich my social life.\n\nI think people see my clothes, or my car, or know what kind of work I do and they think I'm poor, when in reality I have savings, IRA, home equity and commodities.  And a really crappy sense of style, lol.  I have to google whether colors match, etc.  My wardrobe could use some serious work because it is 100% practical, 0% style.  For example I have amazing boots and numerous pairs of stretchy dry-fit cargo pants for work, but I've never owned a decent pair of shoes (any kind) or any \"fancy\" clothes.  My car is actually not old (like all my previous cars), but it is as cheap and generic as they get.\n\nIs being very frugal seen negatively by women?  I feel like it is, big time, but I could be wrong.  What markers do strangers use to judge a person's financial situation?  What investments should I make in order to attract a decent quality partner?  (better clothes, fancier car, higher quality hygiene products)  Or should I focus on trying to make lifestyle changes?  (work more, travel more, spend more lavishly, etc).  Any advice or random thoughts would be appreciated!"

Tired of carrying this around, tired of bombing all my relationships, tired of missing holidays and living in a physical and emotional state of numbness and pure apathy.  I need to share the issues that burden me with someone who knows how to start helping me solve them.  Thanks in advance to any replies!"

I've had a very minimal, extremely poor diet (5 or so meals per week) for the last few years.  I've lost my job, my will to work and produce is all but gone, and the house is next on the chopping block.  I've even completely convinced myself that my kid might be better off without me in his life, and I wouldn't listen to anyone if they tried to convince me otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone know where this rabbit hole eventually goes?  I'm completely falling apart but not a single part of me wants to change anything.  I really do not care, at all.  My latest symptoms are constant eye twitches and occasional, minor auditory hallucinations.  What is the trajectory for someone who's basically given up on life but absolutely refuses to do anything about it?  I just want to maybe somehow be able to prepare my son for the next steps, whatever those are."

                "body": "The thing is, I agree with what you're saying in practice. It is damaging to obsess and pine and suffer over your twinflame, although often I think it is actually necessary for the process. It can act as a catalyst for personal spiritual growth, so I think it is always important to immerse yourself in the experience with an intentionality of where you are going. To me, the twinflame journey is sort of like achieving enlightenment. If enlightenment involves detaching yourself from reality and desire, how do you detach yourself from the desire to be enlightened and still achieve enlightenment? It's just a natural part of the process or path. It seems counterintuitive, but the truth is, if you are meant to be enlightened because that's your destiny, then it'll happen. You will detach yourself from enlightenment, but still reach it because that's where you are meant to be. Twinflame is an ascension pathway, so it works very much the same.\n\nCurrently, I am in the stage of simply accepting the twinflame journey for what it is: my specific ascension pathway, which involves accepting who my twinflame is. Trust me, after everything, I tried to ignore him and explain away his actions as just \"confusion\" and chalk up our relationship simply to being \"a crush,\" but I was lying to myself, and the universe simply wouldn't let me forget about him. We'd been in separation for over a year, and when he came back into my life, I was in the process of trying to manifest my soulmate through self love. I thought what the universe wanted me to do was release all attachments from the past to allow someone new into my life, but repeatedly as I embarked on that journey, something kept subconsciously gnawing at me. I still had the feeling that a particular someone was gonna come back, but kept running from it.\n\nOf course he did come back, and when he did I ended up getting my heart broken by him in the most beautiful way, because it helped me to actual release so much trauma I was carrying. Mostly, because my dad had passed away almost exactly the year prior, triggering my awakening (see how that came full circle), but it also forced me to accept that I actually was in love with him. I am the type of person who bottles up emotions because I don't like conflict, and I was taught that expressing emotions is weak, unmanly, etc. My twinflame triggered me (unintentionally on his part), and it helped me to finally lose control and let go. Sweet ecstasy.\n\nSure after all that, it is fully within my right to walk away from the twinflame journey. But at this point, not acknowledging that he is my twinflame (i.e., that's the role he played) would be rejecting my intuition (even when my mind disagreed), my heart's desire (even after ego repeatedly ran away in fear), not trusting in the universe (like I had done so many times repeatedly, which got me into this mess and caused separation), and denying the ascension process itself. I simply refuse to do those things. So the only thing which I will do is detach from the physical person and align with my higher self, but that itself is just a part of the twinflame journey, ironically. Eventually, he will be magnetically attracted to me just like he has over and over again. It's just fate. It's such an obvious truth at this point, I don't feel particularly \"attached\" to it. Just like I know the sun will come up tomorrow. This is the surrender phase.",

                "body": "I don't necessarily disagree with this post, but I would say it depends. Unless you have truly found your twinflame, you won't understand. You have to really follow your heart/intuition on this one. When it comes to spiritual concepts such as these, they are specific to the person and their journey, so no one else can decide for you.\n\nWhen you find your twinflame, eventually you will realize that you always loved the person and they always loved you back. It was never unrequited, but it appeared that way in 3D because of negative attachments and beliefs which you possessed yourself which will mirror in your twinflame. I agree that eventually you will have to stop pining after your twinflame, because focusing on yourself and aligning with your soul journey is what will attract them into your reality.\n\nYou may have perceived their actions as rejection or manipulation, but it is important to distinguish whether this perception arose from ego/mind or from your heart/intuition telling you. This is the beauty of the false twin-flame, which demonstrates the difference to you. With mine, I was infatuated and mentally convinced myself I was in love with him. But deep down, my heart always told me something was twisted with our relationship. Early on, he dropped his mask for me, and what I felt was darkness and fear, but still I allowed myself to be manipulated and controlled under the illusion because I was so dependent on the attention I was given from him.\n\nWith your true twinflame, your intuition will almost give you this instant unshakeable sense of love and understanding that you will not be able to fully accept at first. A part of you that you can't even control will draw you toward this person, especially the runner in my observation who is \"unaware.\" Your mind/ego won't even be able to process it, which leads to the separation and then runner/chaser dynamic. The connection is so divine that you have to run in circles like that in order to trigger a spiritual awakening to dissolve ego/illusions, and eventually you realize the full depth of your emotions for the person, even as you tried to run away from the connection. No matter what your mind said, a part of you could never shake the feeling that this person was \"the one.\"\n\nNobody said \"love\" was necessarily supposed to be easy, but ultimately the twinflame journey isn't about love or romance. That's a nice little side benefit. It's about spiritual progression. It represents the completion of a much larger karmic cycle which you force you to trust the universe, align with your purpose, confront your shadow, develop your intuition, listen to your heart, dissolve ego, live in the moment, etc., because you will realize that not doing those things were what blocked you from the connection you always desired.\n\nI have not reunited with my twinflame yet, but I know where my path lies ahead. Once I finally accepted what was happening, that this connection was fate, it helped me to walk into the light of truth, and I started regaining memories about the process. Now I am aligning with my power and my destiny. This is my ascension pathway. If the above doesn't resonate with you, then I would advise you step off the twinflame journey, because it's not for you.",

                "body": "Through my spiritual awakening, I've been pondering a lot about the idea of philosophical zombies, or NPCs. Basically, the idea is that could there potentially be certain individuals which are somehow fundamentally \"lacking\" in consciousness, i.e., the subjective experience of reality which is (presumably), linked to the direct manifestation of imaginary phenomena like qualia, sensations, thoughts, emotions, etc. This sort of goes hand-in-hand with the \"do animals have souls\" question. Would certain bodies or vehicles be somehow more \"special/divine\" than others in this regard? It could also go hand in hand with a solipsist idea that \"I\" am the only subjective experience that exists, and everything/everyone might be a sort of soulless trap which functions mechanically/robotically (perhaps overlapping some with computer simulation theory).\n\nCurrently, I'm thinking this premise looks at that things from a limited angle. Subjective consciousness shouldn't be treated as this externalized objective thing which only some have and some don't. It's subjective, and non-real, so completely limitless. You can conceive of subjectively living out of the lives of any specific human being on this planet. So you have to contend that even if you can't directly experience those lives in your current limited state, they still exist somewhere \"out in the ether\" no matter what. You could also conceive the world as a mechanical structure which traps you in a sort of \"matrix.\" But since that's so abstract, it's really up to interpretation. You are also able to conceive of the world which is heavenly and divine in essence, and if the \"computer matrix\" world really was the \"truest\" state of reality, it probably wouldn't give \"you\" or anything or anyone an option one way or the other. Ultimately, it all comes down to subjective choice or free will. It comes down to consciousness, or the \"God-head\" essentially deciding to project itself and experience a limited subjective reality or worldview. And since that divine essence is capable of manifesting itself into literally any limited form, experience, or reality imaginable, it's logical to conclude that they must all be valid in their own way. None of them technically existing in stead of the other.\n\nAnyway, just wondering if anyone vibes with my interpretation or has any other angles to add to this discussion which could help me to see this in another light.

I have an LPVO for it already that goes 1 to 6, but ive recently been taking it off more often in favor of iron sights. Theyre easier to use imo and obviously lighter. I then ran into the problem of cheap plastic flip ups not being fully adjustable. Long story short its between two feyuchi sets, one thats flip up, windage on the rear and elevation on the front(compared to A2 sights i was planning to get before hand). The other ARE a2 sights, fully adjustable rear and offset. But obviously not flip up or anything, just fixed. The problem then is if i were to ever need to put my LPVO back on, which would give me less trouble? The one's perpetually sticking out and have to be turned 45 degrees to use, or the ones that are being obstrucked by a tiny glass looking hole, whose presence defeats the purpose of having iron sights in the first place."

The birth rate during the pandemic have been in an all time low, so they are desperate to get them back up so they can charge 10s of thousands of dollars for each adoption. Not hard to imagine the adoption industry lining some pockets to law makers to make more product happen for them to benefit from.\nAlso a nice healthy dollop of racism is to blame because the Republicans are so scared of losing their white minority status in us population. \nI hate it here so much.",

And for as long as I can remember has been under cooking chicken and turkey, pink chicken is a regular on the dinner table. Yesterday I picked up leftovers from my parents Thanksgiving dinner (do to pandemic was finaly able to not go there for the holidays but they still wanted to share their food with me) and my roommate pointed out the turky is undercooked. Telling me that poultry isnt supposed to be pink or purple, like chicken I've grown up on has been more often then not. It also didnt help that regardless of the quality of the food, my dad would threaten us if we didnt always complement and praise my mom's inept cooking skills.\n\n(We had dinner with my roommate and thier family. Everyone has been quarantining for months and we ate at separate tables. And it was an amazing dinner. So Thanksgivings wasnt a complete disaster)\n\nSince moving out I've not had terrible gut issues and headaches all the time. I now live with someone who knows how to cook and I can enjoy eating food again. But after this revolution I am trying to do research on the effects of regular exposure to undercooked chicken that was left to thaw on the kitchen counter for hours beforehand. And best how to bring this up to my siblings if at all. Any advice would be great."

Didn't think much of it, just wanted to know if it was something I'm eating or just generally exposed to so I can go back to not having to take allergy meds everyday. \n\nThey not only did the normal prick allergy test on my back (most come out positive) but also had me do alot of breath and lung tests, which I was struggling with. Took me like ten tries to get that little cloud through the goal and kept getting light headed with all the deep breaths. I did suspect that I had pollen allergies so the occasional coughing, sneezing and wheezing didnt really raise any red flags. I was out of shape, I did gain weight, it's fine, best to just ignore it. \n\nThe results came in and was told me all the trees, dust mites and mold that I was allergic to (which is most of them in the area, yey). Was told I was allergic to dogs, which did brake my heart cause I absolutely love dogs and was hoping to one day get another one, once living conditions improved. (My last dog died years ago and I'm still getting over that) \n\nWith dreams shattered I was finaly told that I also have asthma, and that the doctor was concerned with the inflammation in my lungs. Prescribed a bunch of meds I need to take daily now. I'm someone who has never been on regular prescriptions for anything, not to mention one of the meds is super expensive and i need to figure how to pay for that regularly. Gave me alot of handouts to read and a sample of the expansive med (arnuity ellipta if anyone was wandering) I was in shock by all the news and just ended up wandering off. \n\nLucky my roommate also has asthma (I think aside from family everyone I'm close to has asthma) so she has been helping me process all the information. I've been playing so many events in my mind of when I couldn't breathe, how I regularly coughed while laughing or crying, and when I had panic attacks I had to lean against an wall while wheezing and my vision would just get dark. I feel like an idiot for not realizing it sooner, or even think asthma was a possibility and feel like I have to play catch up. My poor lungs have been struggling for so long and I just ignored them... \n\nany advice people have would be appreciated and had anyone else a similar experience?\n(Sorry about spelling)"

Create some list of already contacted people to avoid annoying them.\n\nstep 2. we make an arsenal of memes (loveforlandchad related or not) where the subreddit name is hidden/watermarked in the meme or an element in said meme. if we do it enough, putting the name in a meme will become the joke thereby giving us free advertising similar to what zillow does. Dont post anywhere not allowing advertizing brigading is bad.\n\nstep 3. post the memes anywhere applicable\n\nstep 4. any memes posted here should be crossposted anywhere applicable\n\nstep 5. make partnerships with other subreddits ex. r/neoliberal or something\n\nstep 6. ask partners to put our sub on the sidebar, or if you own a sub put it on the sidebar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we as a landchad community bind together, we can overcome the red advisory and show them we can come back better and stronger."

As others have pointed out, Edelgard literally does mourn the dead both in this case and in terms of the war at large in numerous instances, so this is just incorrect on its face\n\n2. Edelgard, as a character, is also pretty explicitly shown to have difficulty expressing this sort of emotional vulnerability for a wide variety of reasons. She has often difficulty being honest with other people about her genuine feelings (seeing herself as a person, rather than just the Emperor), for one thing, and for another she also doesn't really allow herself to dwell much on grief in the first place. This much is clear in her infamous response to Byleth after >!Jeralt's death!< in BE and with the context of her backstory: she's afraid of being paralyzed by the weight of her grief and thinks that the best thing she can do to honor the dead is to carry on in their absence and try to make things better as they would have wanted. This isn't proof that she doesn't care; it's just how she copes\n\n3. I know the Byleth thing is overdone; I find it rather clumsy in execution, myself, but its citation within this post fundamentally misinterprets its inclusion in the first place; the importance of Edelgard's relationship with them goes beyond a simple crush, it's meant to show character development. Edelgard has spent much of her life thinking about herself more as a tool for progress than a human being. Especially in pre-TS, she rarely allows herself moments of genuine rest or happiness, or the freedom to express or be herself at all. She has forced herself to accept the possibility that she will die alone, leaving behind a world that considers her a villain and no one left in it who remembers her even the slightest bit fondly. She suppresses her grief and emotional responses in the name of continuing to move forward at any cost, never allowing herself the time to process or heal. Etc, etc. Part of her arc in CF is her learning that there's more to life than that, and that that's okay: learning to be open with her friends, to allow herself to be silly, to dare to genuinely hope for the future she dreams of and the possibility that she can have her own place in it. You can't be burdened with glorious purpose all the time, regardless of how much something matters to you; it'll only ever make you miserable. People need more than that; they need love and support and understanding - as is a rather central theme of the game. **A person expressing happiness or outside interests in the midst of any sort of intimate or even wide-scale tragedy is not proof that they simply don't care about it.** Having your own identity does not preclude you from caring about an issue, it's just part of being human. And whether you like her or not, Edelgard is human, just like the rest of 3h's protagonists. Dimitri, Rhea, and Claude are all deeply flawed characters who do awful things (some more than others), but who are still capable of finding healing and redemption when they have someone to help them shoulder their burdens. Edelgard is no different. To argue that her healing journey (despite being more clumsily done than some others here) and status as hero in her own route is reductive, disrespectful, etc. while theirs are not quite literally misses the point of the game's central theme and the very purpose of its having routes in the first place. \n\nYou don't have to like Edelgard or her route, nor do you you have to agree with her, but after almost four years, these sorts of inaccurate and uncharitable takes are just getting increasingly tiring to encounter",

After seven years, they know how their player base works, and they obviously knew which characters were in the running; I have a hard time attributing the decision to put not one but two predictable frontrunners into a banner running *during* the poll to sheer coincidence and ignorance. I'm not saying they're trying to rig the entire poll, but this is an odd choice, and there's no way they didn't know on some level that it would mess with the results. Feel free to interpret the decision however you like, but with the context we have denying that much boarders on the intentionally dense",

I mean her base design is nice, I guess, but I honestly don't see a point in trying to get her a win for early story/character reveals or the like when we know all of this is already coming to us eventually (she's pretty much guaranteed a nice Leg. and probably a Seasonal alt in like a year or so) and Feh's storylines and OCs aren't exactly known for being all that good anyway. It just seems like a waste to vote prematurely on a character that you simply don't know anything about\n\n- I'm honestly not sure how to feel about IS releasing this banner during CYL. It was funny at first, but the longer I think about it it seems just... kinda tacky, honestly. Not only is it a pretty clear attempt to meddle with the results, but they're also doing it in just about the cheapest way possible. They apparently don't want to give us a Brave alt, alright, but even when they're seemingly trying to stop that from happening the farthest they're willing to go is a demote and TT unit?? It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and I'm not going to stop voting for Soren because of it, regardless of his chances. GL to Byleth fans, too, I don't think I can spare a vote for him between Soren and Bernie but if he somehow manages to pull a win I'll be happy for y'all\n\n- I've said this before but I'm just so annoyed at the state of BE in this game. Every student character except Dedue from both of the other two houses has a seasonal version, meanwhile half of the BE characters are relegated to just increasingly awful base alts. I know seasonal hell isn't ideal for most people, but personally I tend to prefer seasonal alts better than base ones. I think the new themes and designs are usually fun, and in addition the units on these banners are often stronger than ones in the regular pool. You consistently have opportunities to summon specifically for them (albeit once every year, but that is more often than most regular banners rerun), and, even if you don't end up liking them or they aren't very good, the same character is still pretty much guaranteed a decent base version somewhere down the line (especially given 3h's overall popularity). The only versions of Hubert, Ferdinand, Petra, and Linhardt in the entire game are pretty obsolete (except Linhardt who was DOA instead) and often difficult to make into a worthy investment - and we have no idea when or if they'll get anything more than that. Especially since IS almost exclusively distributes their spots on banners towards Dorothea (discounting Edelgard since house leader alts seem to be released together anyway). As much as I like her, she's not the only character here I want to see, and it's getting old really quickly to watch all the other characters I like and who could do with a new version get passed over for her. I get that some people here have it worse, and I'm not trying to be entitled about it, I've just been kinda frustrated watching so many characters I like and want to use keep getting blocked out of new alts/banners - especially amidst last year's complaints from BL and GD fans in particular about BE being favored, despite being in better positions overall and generally avoiding these same pitfalls",

Definitely some people will like them enough to vote for them and IS will probably still do a lot of Engage banners to get them all into the game (like we saw with 3h), but I am wondering if enough of its characters will have large enough fanbases to fully sweep CYL again like we saw with 3h. Especially if the writing complaints are accurate, the most popular characters already have versions in by then, and/or the hype has died down enough, I think there's a decent chance that its cast will have some trouble winning over older/more dedicated fans. We'll see how people feel about them when the game comes out",

Idk, I miss being their Cher (from Clueless) but I guess friends are unpredictable and that's okay. I don't wanna be a pushover either :/ I'll just  be happy seeing them happy, it's like you've all grown apart but just feel happy for each other. Whatever:/\n\nIt's like you're already an introvert and two of your friends are more introverted than you so you have to keep checking on them so you feel like they don't forget you and you have other two friends who are hella extroverted and your wavelengths don't match but still hangout with them coz they're kinda family? \n\nWhy is it always this or none. Talk to me about your existential crisis. Talk to me how you're bored of being bored. Why don't they like talk at alllll. It's like we meet up once and it's over. I totally respect their space but it's like they have too much space with their other friends too. I'm my own person and they're their own people, it's just that it fucking hurts when you know you all are drifting apart and you can't do shit about it. Coz you have your own thing too. I mean they will always be the closest friends I ever had especially two of em girlies. I can't really find anyone else's wavelength in sync as much as ours does. But I guess yearly meets will do because adult friendships work that way. But I dk if they still think of me that way. I have real bad insecurity issues. And I NEVER WANNA BE TOXIC TO THEM. NEVER. I'll let them be. I mean I too have my own thing going on. But being connected virtually only like really sucks coz you rarely interact and there's gonna be a lot of miscommunication. Whatever. I hope they think that our group is irreplaceable too like I do. Me and my 2 close girlies. I need hella lot of space too and I respect theirs. Meh. I'mma update when I'm like 60 yrs old or smthng I feel fucking stupid"

My voice always gets so shaky when trying to tell students to stop making noice and I get out of breath too and sometimes they don\u2019t even stop? I\u2019m sure my students notice my anxiety and that just makes me more anxious and I just feel so stupid and I hate how it makes me look. My anxiety is noticeable in my voice but once I actually start solving questions on the board and not just explaining I feel more centered and I\u2019m actually able to engage with the students and it actually feels like they listen and actually ask questions too(not all but some anyway) Today as I was about to walk up the stairs I passed through a group of girls from the senior class ( i don\u2019t even take that class) and as i went up I overheard one of them say \u201cdon\u2019t stare at her you\u2019ll make her fall\u201d and they giggled. I\u2019m quite small in terms of height and some of them are bigger than me and I\u2019m pretty sure this is a contributing factor but honestly it all just feels like a surreal nightmare and I hate it so much. Please advise and support would be appreciated. I genuinely think I\u2019m a good teacher and people who actually listen understand and I always emphasize the importance of asking questions but I feel some of my students don\u2019t respect me. I feel so embarrassed. Like I don\u2019t know how to present myself in a respectable way."

                "body": "I need some advice about potential romantic interest from a bartender. TLDR is at the bottom.\n\nFor backstory, I've been going to this bar pretty frequently the past couple months and have gotten to know this bartender pretty well. For the sake of ease, we'll call her \"S\". The conversations are always fun, I ask S to make me something new any time I'm in, as she loves making cocktails and trying new ones and having me try new ones she likes. On slower nights like the Sundays, she'll talk with me way more, ask me to move seats to the sink so she can talk while cleaning glasses, will stay after her shift is over to talk with me more, etc. Any time I'm there, it feels like she's super interested. That being said, I tip decently. Not just her, but everyone at the bar, usually $10 if it's just her and the tab is $30-40, or $15-20 if its above $50 tab or there's 2 bartenders. I bartended briefly at a brewery, so I understood the appreciation behind an extra couple bucks. \n\nNow, for the mixed signals part I need help figuring out.  Every time I am in, she definitely goes out of her way for conversation when she's not in a stressed mood, loves to have me try new drinks she makes, and always says no the first couple times I ask for my check so I'll stay longer (even tho she knows I won't order anything else and will always give her the same general tip as described above). She asked me deep questions about my personality, how I am in relationships, how I was shaped into the person i am, about my values and why I'm interested in what I am, detailed questions about my sex life, and other questions friendly bartenders dont usually ask. She gave me her number as soon as I asked a little over 2 weeks ago, and was very playful and bantering about all of it.\n\nNow, she's very, very difficult to get ahold of via text. No idea why. I tried making a date and that fell through the weekend after she gave it to me, and then it happened again last week. We were saying that thursday night could work, but she might have plans and wasn't too sure. But there was little to no texting back except apologizing at 4 AM the night that she is a terrible communicator and it's something she's working on. Not a problem, but she's been incredibly difficult at getting a hold of still.  This lead me to asking her point blank if she really was interested this past Friday, and I'd back off if she's not and just have things go back to the way they were before she gave me her number. She looked me dead in the eye and told me she was interested. She promised me she'd let me know Sunday night if she's free this week to go out, but I haven't heard from her. I know this past weekend was stressful for her so I've kind of just given her space since sunday as I know she's really introverted in her spare time and probably needs to unwind. I'm not trying to be pushy about anything and I'm trying to walk the thin line between showing interest and not being pushy or a dick about anything.\n\n\nI guess my biggest question to all of you, is if she's gotten into a web of being afraid to lose me as a regular who she enjoys talking to and getting a decent tip from, but doesn't know how to tell me she's not romantically interested. And if so, what's the best way to tell her it doesn't matter and I'd rather just keep having the fun nights at the bar for both of us? The only reason I'm not just doing that is that I know I can start to emotionally withdraw from women I'm interested in but confused by (I won't go into the reasons why cuz, I dont think are important here). I dont want that withdrawal to come from my complete lack of understanding, so I'd rather have advice if any of you could offer it. I mean this all may be caused by something else  I would never consider without another POV.  I'm not worried about feeling like a fool who got played by someone taking my money, it's just complicated to describe it. I dont like not understanding the situation I suppose. I have no desire to manipulate the outcome of this situation, I just want better understanding. \n\nThanks for the feedback and time.\n\n\nTLDR; Am interested in bartender who initially showed interest in me. Shows a lot of interest in me in person (moreso than what one would expect from a friendly bartender), but is terrible at communicating via text. I need help understanding what the deal is and how to just resume the fun conversations and bar nights without assumption of romantic interest."

I saw that you could use gel instead of injections and it would produce the same results, but would be inconsistent and you can't really workout. I also heard that since your body doesn't produce enough T, you would have to take T for the rest of your life. I just want to take T for a while and then stop and never take it again. I'm fine with having my period and having thicker thighs and stuff, it's just that I want to look like a guy. Whether that's a feminine or masculine looking guy doesn't matter. But if I stop T, would that mean that the fat distribution would revert to how it was before using T? I would prefer having a more masculine-looking face, broader shoulders, and a masculine torso + less feminine waist (though having a thin waist is fine), and as said before, I'm fine with feminine legs and hips/what I have right now. I've heard that your voice doesn't revert, which is good because I have a high-pitched voice. So... what would revert? What would I look like if I stopped T? If I got muscles and abs when on T and then stopped T, would the abs and muscles slowly 'disappear' because of the gained fat? I don't plan on removing my uterus, so I would still produce estrogen. Also heard that sometimes sexual orientation changes when on T, is that true? How common is that. No offence, but I don't want to start liking girls.\n\n**Surgery**  \nIn the future, I want to have top surgery. I have paranoia about stuff like surgeries going wrong, so I wanted a really good and recommended surgeon with good results, preferably one who could do keyhole (I have a pretty small chest compared to others, though I don't know if it's small enough because my size doesn't exist for bras, so I don't exactly know my bra size). Are there any surgeons anyone could recommend?"

Everything about this second kiddo is different, not necessarily bad and in some ways it\u2019s easier. I\u2019m just having a really hard time with him not being able to breastfeed. I\u2019m exclusively pumping, and it\u2019s just draining me mentally. I want to stop, but my guilt is so strong! I breastfed my 4.5 year old daughter for a year, and I loved that special connection. It breaks my heart that I don\u2019t want to continue because I know it\u2019s what\u2019s best for him and I have great supply. I just... hate this. I hate myself for feeling this way. \n\nBackstory on our journey if you\u2019re curious:\n\nI knew there were problems in the hospital because his latch was just so painful, and after he lost a pound in 2 days we started supplementing with formula until my milk came in the next day and I started exclusively pumping. Had his lip and tongue ties clipped 3 days later at 5 days old, but he still couldn\u2019t latch. He can finally latch with a nipple shield, but still screams for more after feeding for 40 minutes. I\u2019ve met with an IBCLC for help and she just said that it will take time for his mouth to be able to suck properly. We do all the tongue training exercises and only do paced bottle feeding. I still try to breastfeed him and he latches and nurses, but after he passes out he screams bloody murder, won\u2019t latch again, and will drain a 4oz bottle. Something is clearly not right with his sucking, latch, or something... and it absolutely kills me emotionally after going through all that because I not able to give him what he needs. It\u2019s wearing on me and I hate myself for it.\n\nThanks for listening"

So that already has me on edge, but we are pretty much bunkered down until this kid comes so I\u2019m not too concerned about us getting COVID. \n\nMy REAL worry is that we have to have someone to take care of our 4.5 year old. This wasn\u2019t an issue since we made a plan for her months ago and we\u2019ve been lining up backups. Here\u2019s the problem, just like everywhere in the country (hell, the world!) cases are skyrocketing and 2 of the families we have lined up to watch our daughter have been exposed to COVID in the past 2 days!! We live in a huge tourist destination so people are everywhere, and everyone works with the public. I have this panicked feeling like everyone we have lined up is going to have an exposure, and my husband won\u2019t be able to be with me. And my 2 best friends are the ones that have had exposures so I would be all alone giving birth! \n\nWith Thanksgiving coming up, I am legit losing my shit. I need this baby out of my so I can stop worrying about having someone to watch our kiddo and just be home where it\u2019s safe. I know everyone is dealing with this, but I feel like I\u2019m reaching a breaking point. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine, but right now I just want it all to over so I can stop worrying."

I\u2019ve not tapped into real discipline yet.\n\nSo what works for me is... yes, to actually go into school so I wouldn\u2019t let myself fail too much.

Agnostic, but I have religious upbringing (for context).\n\n5) In general I\u2019m serious and I treat things seriously, but I\u2019m open minded and won\u2019t dismiss anything as not deserving any thought or consideration. I\u2019m pretty passionate, so combined with general openness I could come off as intense (if you want lighter or more casual, I\u2019m not for you). \n\nMy expectation:\n\n1) A passionate person but still open minded and chill about knowledge, who always aims for self improvement too and not just general objective success.\n\n2) A decent, respectful person. Basic love for people, though you might not adhere to every whim (you shouldn\u2019t). \n\n3) Someone who can challenge my views but still respect where I come from and what\u2019s important for me. Doesn\u2019t dismiss whatever views I have, because I won\u2019t do it to you. \n\n4) Someone who\u2019s also looking for passionate and serious connection.\n\n5) preferably older or same age, but maturity is a must. Even if he currently can\u2019t see himself in detailed way in the next 5 or 10 years, he knows his general direction and how to go there.\n\nYou can comment here or dm me."

When they were verified by my physicians and counselor, I immediately contacted my boss and let them know that there were a few things happening with me personally that I would need to continue to address for the foreseeable future.  I didn\u2019t get into the weeds about them, but I did give a general explanation.  Her immediate response was for me to file FMLA paperwork (you can\u2019t do this yet, but you can at the 12 month mark) and to see if I wanted to request accommodations (extended timelines for projects, frequent breaks throughout the day).  I didn\u2019t need the accommodations, but I did file the FMLA paperwork, to have time off if I ever needed it.  I never had to use that, either, but it was there for me if I did.  \n\nI was very fortunate that my employer at that time was very cognizant of the impact of mental health issues on their employees (I worked for a state agency and this particular agency had a lot of stress-related illness and attrition that they were constantly working to improve on)  and they did adjust my schedule (come in later, leave later) to help with appointment scheduling issues.  I was very lucky.  \n\nI hope you will consider having a conversation with your boss (who seems to truly want you to succeed) about your issues-again, not a dump-truck session of all your ills, but a general description of what you\u2019re dealing with) so that they can work with you to create a strategy that makes everyone in this scenario a winner.  I wish you the very best as you work toward becoming an asset at your workplace!",

I finally got everything hooked up yesterday.  But I had to call and they put in a whole new \"order\" for my services.  When I look in my account there are actually 3 orders showing for the same package:  June 5th, June 6th, and June 16th.  Customer service assured me my price would reflect the discount (I had to order before June 7th to get this deal) and that I would receive my Visa card as specified in the deal.  I just want to make sure that's going to happen.  I don't want to get shafted after I waited so long to find a fair deal from Comcast (they are the only service available where I live, other than ViaSat).    My question is:  with these three orders, will I get the original deal that I requested.  Edited to add:  My X1 TV service is still showing as \"Pending Activation\" although I have service on both boxes and internet is working fine.  I suspect this is also why my Xfinity Stream is not working."

The new position provides a 403b plan, which I won't be fully vested in until year two (with a nice match, too).  My plan is to bump my retirement contribution to 8%, which is 3% higher than what I contribute now.  I received a hefty raise taking this position, so I think this is a good move.  \n\nHere's my issue:  I know I can pull this money out of these accounts and put it into an IRA or something similar, and that would probably be a good thing, as I cannot access this money until the retirement age the state would have allowed me to retire (68) without losing some of the contributions if I retire earlier.  I think I've come to the conclusion that pulling it out and putting it somewhere else is a good idea.  I just don't know where I need to put it.  \n\nMy last official day is next week, so I'm trying to figure out where it needs to go so I can get the paperwork in to the Retirement Department.  \n\nThank you for your advice in advance!"

I have to preface this with the disclaimer that neither of us is really \"sociable\" in the workplace and we've never hung out together outside of work.  There isn't a history of friendship between us, but now that she's been promoted we do interact a great deal more than we did before. \n\nHer mother passed last year and I attended the visitation, and since then she has really started to come to me when work stresses her out (my position lends itself to that, but she's only a year younger than me and we're not young folk).  It's led to a very good working relationship.\n\nRight after her mother died, she brought me some things from her mother that she thought I would like.  Collectibles, nothing outrageous.  I was very touched by that gesture and thanked her...and then yesterday, she brought me some of the same collectibles from her own collection.  She'd had them for awhile and decided that she wanted me to have them.  They are somewhat pricey (I've collected these too, for many years, so I knew what she probably had invested in them) and I tried to offer her money for them because they were rather expensive.  She would have none of it.  Again, I was touched and overwhelmed by the gesture.  It was so kind and generous of her.\n\nSo, lying in bed last night I asked my fiance, \"Do you think she has some kind of ulterior motive?  Like, why would she give me those just out of the blue?\"  My fiance works with us and he's known her for many, many years.  \n\nHe just looked at me and said, \"You know people can be nice to you just for the sake of being nice.  She's never really been 'friendly' with anyone as long as I've known her and I think for some reason she just connects with you.  You're always helpful when she needs it and you're not one to judge people in their weaker, stressful moments.  Just take it as her being kind, and return the kindness when you see she needs it.  Sometimes you're overly paranoid, babe.\"\n\nI hate that my brain is wired like this, that I doubt that I would ever merit someone's kindness just for the joy it brings them.  She was very happy to see my reaction to her gift, and I felt underlying guilt for the rest of the day-as if I'd somehow swindled her out of those things.  But I didn't.  \n\nI did at least recognize that I was thinking and feeling irrationally, and to have my fiance tell me, \"Hey, she likes you because you're very likeable\" was somewhat of an affirmation...but damn...I wish my brain didn't just go there to that place where the inner voice is screaming, \"IT'S A SET UP!\""

The living situation is very strange (Dad's brother lives with them, and Dad/Brother are the primary caregivers, as Mom is the only one working).\n\nWe had some pretty horrendous storms blow through last week, one in our town that was severe, dropping pea-sized hail and involving a lot of lightning and heavy rain.  We got caught in our car coming back from visiting a relative.  We were safe enough, but when we pulled into the driveway in the middle of this deluge/lightning storm, I look over into the neighbors' yard and see their two youngest children in diapers playing in this storm!  Literally, branches are falling out of trees due to the wind, there is hail (HAIL!) falling and the lightning is horrible.  My fiance got out of the truck and ran to our house and I just sat there...sobbing instantly at what I was seeing.  I mean it was literally, I saw this and I just burst into tears.  My son was there with me (he also has CPTSD) and he was like, \"What?  What's wrong?\"  I pointed out the window and he was enraged.\n\nTheir parents/uncle were nowhere to be found.  There was a ton of furniture on their front porch (they've been remodeling for the last 3 months, as this house was trashed by the last owners, bought for a song by the new owners) and there was no line of sight from the front of the house to the yard.\n\nOh, and did I mention it was HAILING!  LIGHTNING!  POURING TORRENTIAL RAIN!  BRANCHES FALLING OUT OF THE MANY TREES AROUND THESE KIDS!\n\nI finally pulled myself together and went inside.  I told my fiance what was going on and he said, \"Eventually we are going to end up calling the police on them, because those babies are out there all the time with zero supervision.\"  My son then informed me that the kids are often left in the car, in their carseats with no windows open and no engine running.  He said he'd witnessed that at least twice himself and the most recent time he went to the car and opened the doors so they would have fresh air.\n\nI know I was triggered by this, but am I overreacting?  I don't think I am, but I know that at some point these people are going to end up having a serious accident with these kids and the dad/uncle oversight is practically non-existent.  Dad/Uncle both have some form of autism/spectrum disorder, but I don't think that's excusable behavior?  Is it?\n\nHelp!!!!\n\nEdited to clarify Spectrum disorder in adults"

                "body": "Let me apologize in advance if the formatting is weird,  I am posting from my phone.  \n\nI recently became engaged to my boyfriend of 2+ years. It was a surprise and I was very happy to accept his proposal.  We are older adults, over 40 with teenagers.  Our relationship has been through some rocky places and of course I have been in therapy for the last 9 months working through my diagnosis.  \n\nThe crux of this post is simple: my family has never accepted him or approved of him as my partner.  He has been a steady, grounding force in my life,  but they just see him as an intruder.  I have been in many relationships and have been married before and this dynamic is nothing new to me.  My family is very insular and they tend to not take kindly to new people in the mix. It ranges from indifference to outright, obvious dislike,  as it is in his case. This goes even for men they've introduced me to- at some point they decide they no longer care for that person and he's no longer their pick, so it's a no win situation with me. \n\nMy child has not liked him from the beginning as they tend to vie for my time, attention and affection.  They have had some serious issues with one another but we've managed to find a balance that is tenuous but working.  They just kind of do their own thing and dont get in each other's way.   His child and I get along very well and I genuinely care for him. He's easy to get on with.  \n\nMy fiance came to me today and asked me if I thought our engagement was right, meaning should we have taken this step.  With the opposition from my family and the reaction of my child ( which completely messed up the whole joyous vibe my fiance had) he is now questioning if this is something we need to walk back.  His anger with my child is palpable and he cannot understand why my parents will not just be happy for me, accept him and wish us well. \n\nI cannot seem to make him understand that none of this is about him. He says I've handled the situation poorly-i didn't announce it publicly until this weekend- and he's convinced that my hesitation means something it doesn't mean...namely that I'm not as ecstatic about this as he was or some nonsense like that. I  had my reasons for waiting but my explanation isn't enough for him. \n\nHis family,  on the flipside,  is very pleased with the engagement and I've gotten nothing but congratulations and well wishes from them.  They are always very kind to me and my child.  They're happy that my fiance is happy.  \n\nI responded to his concerns by telling him that I really don't care about how my family feels about this because they're going to feel this way about every decision I make.  This is why I don't have much to do with them at all. Nothing I do really suits them so why bend myself to the point of breaking trying to make them be okay with me? No, I did that shtick for far too many years.  I don't play that way anymore.  And as far as my child is concerned,  he's set to graduate in a year and he has his own life to live and I fully encourage that. His life is not mine to live and vice versa. He knows that is how I feel about it and he may not like it but he'll accept it.  \n\nI'm so upset because I feel like once again,  even though I have set my life up to be independent and decisive on my own terms these people are able to exercise their will over me yet again.  I told my fiance, \"I don't care what they approve of,  I'm a grown adult. I don't need that from them \"\n\nBut he does and its something he'll never get from them. He's an outsider and he's taken over their place of power in my life, as they see it.  Nothing he says or does will change that for them.  Time won't make a difference to them.  \n\nI feel bad for somehow negating his feelings in this. He said that it's breaking his heart and I told him not to give them that much power over him, but he's wired differently than I am and he's never had to deal with anything like this.  \n\nAny feedback you guys can provide is appreciated.  I never open up like this so you should know its weighing heavily on me. \n\nThank you!"

I think I didn't taste a large enough sample before and the smell may have been throwing me off psychologically (alongside the ingredients lists). Sorry for wasting your time but I really appreciate everyone's input. Great community you guys have here!\n\nI recently ordered 3KG of pea and brown rice protein isolate powder that was advertised as containing no additives, but upon receiving the protein, I could smell and taste sweetness that suggests additives. \n\nThe ingredients label lists 'natural flavour and sweetener (steviol)\" but when I called the company to confirm, they were adamant that the protein only contained isolates, with no additives whatsoever. They said the label was incorrect. \n\nSo my question is, is there a way to test for flavours/sweeteners (or at least steviol) using common household items/ingredients? Could I add something to the powder that would cause a reaction with steviol or other common sweeteners? This might be a silly question but I thought I'd check anyway. Appreciate any advice!"

                "body": "Hi everyone, I've recently completed the QHHT Level 1 course but have no prior background in counselling or clinical hypnosis. I have however read about 10 of Dolores's books along with many other metaphysical books, and have listened to countless hours of metaphysical (mostly NDEs) and psychology discussions online. I know it's not necessary to practise QHHT, but would a counselling and/or clinical hypnosis training program add much benefit to my ability/success as a QHHT practitioner? I am already a good and empathetic listener and can see situations and problems from multiple perspectives (e.g. how the other person may think/devil's advocate) but I feel that learning specific mental therapy techniques and theories may enhance my effectiveness as a therapist, especially during the pre and post interviews. I have only practised on two people so far, by the way.\n\nHas anyone else studied any other sort of mental health therapy? Did you study before or after obtaining your QHHT qualification? Do you feel they add value to QHHT - can you not imagine doing QHHT without your other qualifications?\n\nThanks for any input!"

                "body": "Hi, I submitted a ticket to MSI Australia regarding the consistently high junction temperature of my new card:\n\n\"I recently purchased an RX 6900 XT GAMING Z TRIO and have noticed higher than expected junction temperatures during games and GPU stress tests.\n\nThe junction temperature easily reaches 110C out of the box with default settings, so I lowered the GPU voltage from 1200mV to 1100mV (lowest stable mV) via the Radeon driver app while keeping the default max frequency at 2574Mhz and limited the fans to 2500rpm. I also played around with my case fans to further optimise airflow (I'm using five fans). With these new settings, my GPU temperature now reaches a maximum of ~65C (very happy with this!) but my junction temperature is still very high in comparison at 100C +/- a few degrees with an ambient room temperature of about 20-25C.\n\nWhile i know that AMD have stated a maximum junction temperature of 110C, I'm concerned by the huge ~35-40C delta between the GPU and junction temperatures. I've read online that some people have found success in lowering temperatures by tightening the GPU heatsink screws and/or replacing the stock thermal compound. I don't want to void warranty by trying these out but I'm worried that the junction temperature will reach 110C and beyond during summer, even while undervolting. I'd ideally like to overclock the GPU higher (especially as it's the unlocked 'Z' model) but I'm limited by the high junction temperature.\n\nAre you able to offer any advice about this issue? Is 40C a normal temperature difference between the GPU and junction temperatures for this card?\n\nI'm using Windows 11 64bit, 16GB DDR4 RAM at 3600Mhz, 750w EVGA power supply, MSI Tomahawk 570S, and a Ryzen 5600x CPU.\"\n\nMSI's reply: \n\n\"This temperature is normal, please feel free to use it.\"\n\nI was expecting a bit more advice but feel as if my enquiry was brushed aside. Do you guys think I'm worrying about nothing?\n\nThanks!"

There\u2019s others too, but those are some popular ones other take. You may also be primarily inattentive ADHD. I have combined, which is hyperactive and Inattentive, but my inattentive behavior is a bit worse and more noticeable, for me, than my hyperactivity. You could also try instant release form of Adderall, both have similar effects but can work better or worse for different people. Many people who only have inattentive subset of ADHD could not  notice because it\u2019s not as obviously intrusive, though others notice so that should be a good sign. Feel free to PM or reply on the comment if you have any questions or would like to know more! It can take a bit for your system to get used to the medications and to help you realise what it\u2019s doing for you. Would definitely suggest doing tasks that are more challenging for you, as someone suggested above. Hope this can help some!",

I have little-to-no experience, did learn how to aim and shoot in summer camp many years back but was very short-lived. It\u2019s always intrigued me seeing it still pop up so much in our media and seeing things around here have made me want to get into it, or at least give it a good try. If there\u2019s any tips for certain bows for beginners,  or like key things to know before starting and learning, I\u2019d be very thankful to hear your experiences to find a plan of my own. Thank you to anyone who reads and hoping to hear some cool things to consider on this topic! \ud83d\ude0e"

About 6 months ago my boyfriend and I bought a house so her environment DID change, but she didn\u2019t start crying in her bed until about 2 weeks ago and she WAILS all night.\n\nHere are things I\u2019ve ruled out:\n\n\n-too cold - I turned my heat to 70 and she has a bunch of warm blankets in there\n\n\n-too hot - moved her bed away from its \nnormal spot by the radiator \n\n\n-hungry? She eats at 6 and we go to bed at 9:30 so doubtful\n\n\n-there\u2019s nothing rough or sharp poking inside her cage - I looked\n\n\n-smells - I wash her bedding in unscented detergent so I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s a perfume smell in there irritating her\n\n\n-pain - she has arthritis but we do laser therapy for it monthly and she takes cosequin, plus she doesn\u2019t cry about it any other time except when I put her in her cage\n\n\nOverall I doubt it\u2019s something physical and think it\u2019s separation anxiety. I\u2019ve noticed that even when I leave her downstairs but take a particularly long time in our upstairs bathroom (maybe upwards of 40 minutes on a good everything shower) I hear her start to cry.\n\nHas anyone had luck dealing with a similar situation?"

I'm trying to find true crime cases where the suspect's defense was \"religious beliefs\" or \"god told me to\" and other things like that. I was also thinking there could possibly be a case of schizophrenia being confused for god speaking to them, telling them to do things. I'm very bad at researching and looking for specific things that I'm trying to find. I was hoping ,since I watch a lot of horror and thriller, that one of the ones that I remember and somewhat fits for being a topic in my essay, is a true story.\n\nSo far I've found [Willowbrook state school](https://www.google.com/search?q=willowbrook+state+school&safe=strict&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS881US881&ei=iPm4YKKRKqOr5NoPsIiy2AE&oq=willowbrook&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAEYATIECAAQQzIHCAAQsQMQQzIHCC4QsQMQQzIECAAQQzIICC4QxwEQrwEyCAgAELEDEIMBMgsILhCxAxDHARCvATIICC4QxwEQrwEyCwguELEDEMcBEK8BMgsIABCxAxCDARDJAzoKCC4QxwEQrwEQQzoLCC4QsQMQxwEQowI6BQgAELEDOg4ILhCxAxCDARDHARCjAjoICC4QsQMQgwE6BQguELEDOgUIABCRAlCjE1iKLWCCPmgBcAJ4AIABnAGIAfUJkgEDNy41mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdperABAMABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz), salem witch trials of course, hate crimes,  [and William and Christine Hermanson doing nothing but praying for illness to go away](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/20/us/religion-rejected-as-murder-defense.html). I mostly just choose articles that I personally find interesting. Partially because it's subconscious, partially because I want to be motivated to get this done. Anyways- I have also [found articles](https://bulletin-archive.hds.harvard.edu/articles/springsummer2007/does-religion-cause-violence) written about [this similar topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_violence), but that's all. I'm really trying to find an absolute horror story of a murder or multiple murders where the drive is extremist beliefs or just pure insanity with religion being their outlet.\n\nSince the focus is religion in America I want to focus mostly on the christian and catholic religion. This is only one topic of many other topics about the effects/impact of religion in America. I have just found this topic to be extra difficult to research and I remembered that there are probably people on reddit who love stuff like true crime and are good at researching unlike me.\n\nThat's really all. I really hope I'm not breaking any guidelines- from what I've read I'm pretty sure I am. That's all, thank you if you do end you helping! also if you do wanna help, just comment don't dm me please.

Brain fog is there and kind of forgot about it. \n\nI had to sort some drama while withdrawaling and I couldn't figure out why I couldn't think. It was stressing me out but after I slept I felt better. \n\nIm a lot more soft spoken now and sweet and kind. Closer to the loveable person I was known for in the past. Lately while smoking weed, I was more angsty, more irriatable and angry. More arrogant and demanding. Now, more \"don't worry, be happy\". \n\nAdhd symptoms have gotten worse though, more spacey and more distracted by random things. Because of this, I'm more unsure now than ever. While smoking weed i was more sure of how I wanted to proceed with my life, I've lost that confidence and now I'm more \"\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\" as to what lies in my future. \n\nOverall its positive changes but the negatives are there. Just being more soft spoken is enough because I feel I can be more cheerful to people and do less harm in this world."

They also told him he could take the 2nd dose anytime between 6 weeks and 3 months after the 1st dose. \n\nHe came back to our state, tried to schedule an appointment for the 2nd dose and the doctors told him they weren't able to give him the 2nd Moderna, he'd have to start over and take the 1st Pfizer, which he didn't want to do since he heard on the news you can't mix the vaccines. \n\nAnd now it's 8 weeks after the 1st dose. The 2nd Moderna is available, however we can't find a single clinic to give him the 2nd Moderna dose. Several different medical clinics and VA clinics are giving us different information as to why they can't give him his 2nd dose. Excuses range from - each state has their own dosing so they can't dose for him, there's no way to prove he got his first one (we have the vaccination card with the batch information he received), or because 6 weeks passed he has to start over.... \n\nNone of these excuses about why he can't receive the 2nd dose make any sense. It's very aggravating.\n\nHas anyone else had this experience or know of anyone else with this issue?"

She didn't care about it much and I liked it, we were fine. She was not using they/them but I didn't insist on that. (I am cool with all pronouns but they/them hit different lol.)\n\nMy country and where I grow up is kinda homophobic, transphobic, etc. My friend was crying in the morning and I thought 'If I create an account in my language where anyone will be themselves it would be great.' and I told my friends about it on my Instagram and they were proud of me for being this honest and brave. One of my relatives asked me if it would be okay for her to follow. The goal was to share my ideas and takeout from a term in LGBTQ+ to allies or the members of my country.\n\n2 hours later my mom started to scream at me telling me:\n\nYOU ARE DOING THIS FOR ATTENTION\n\nYOU ARE TRYING TO BECOME SOMEONE ELSE\n\nYOU BLONG TO THIS COUNTRY YOU CAN NOT DO THAT\n\nand literally [WHAD WAH DA REASON???](https://youtu.be/_cF377eW0nU)\n\nWHY ARE YOU LETTING PEOPLE JUDGE YOU she also talked about people sexually seeing me because I am non-binary. \n\nthose didn't make sense to me but whatever. I am not sad about being nonbinary. I am worried a bit. I didn't mean to break my mom's heart or her trust. I didn't want to make her sad I just wanted to let her know how I feel and by creating that account I wanted to reach people from my country. Hope things get better but right now I just want to go back in time. I really didn't mean to hurt her.\n\nmaybe creating an account was a bit to much but I really wanted to see people in the community from my country too."

Hope you like it, and feel free to ask me stuff I may have missed.\n\n> **Silver Eyed Race** \n\nLet\u2019s start by giving them a legit name because the former\u2019s a mouthful. Going forward, members of the Silver Eyed race are called: **Za\u2019fid** (za f\u0113d) \n\n> **Development, application & costs of the eyes\u2019 power** \n\n\u2014 Using and developing the Silver Eyes\u2019 power can start at age 7. While the power\u2019s still typically triggered by a desire to protect life, using it properly requires mental and emotional focus. Hence, it is difficult and *dangerous* to begin training at that age. (Just because you can, doesn\u2019t mean you should.)  \n\u2014 The bigger/stronger the Grimm, the more strain it puts on the user. Overexertion will cause physical ailments from fatigue, to blindness (temporary or permanent, depending on severity), to death. A key factor involved is in how long & how often a Za\u2019fid utilized their power and to a proper extent. A Za\u2019fid that\u2019s lived long and used their eyes often will truly be a tension-ruining, immersion-breaking powerhouse. That however is a huge mountain to climb, as vaporizing a Boarbatusk typically leaves a pre-pubescent Za\u2019fid with bloody tears and a day-long migraine (both of which inhibit further usage for some time). \n\n\u2014 So if Maria hadn\u2019t lost her eyes she theoretically could vaporize the Leviathan and (worst case scenario) take a quick nap to recover; whereas, with Ruby, her eyes would melt into a bloody mess before dropping dead. \n\n> **Za\u2019fid physical and psychological development**\n\n\u2014Sometime after puberty begins, Za\u2019fids develop a bloodlust of sorts. While they refer to this as a natural part of growing up, civilized societies colloquially dubbed it \u201cthe **Truculence**\u201d. This is simply an urge to kill Grimm lest they grow restless and kill people or animals instead. The worst-case scenario for this is the Truculence can cause a Za\u2019fid to literally \u201cwake up and choose violence\u201d. Additionally, their aura increases by a tiny bit when they do kill living things with auras.\n\n\u2014But much like puberty, the Truculence becomes *manageable* after reaching maturity, provided they\u2019ve had proper support and training in their developmental years. Some Za\u2019fids are even lucky enough to live peacefully in civilization (villages, cities, etc) in the brief time they spend there. \n\n> **Za\u2019fid Lifestyle and Culture Lore** \n\n\u2014Despite what I just previously said, Za\u2019fids were generally nomadic and minimalistic. With few tangible exceptions, the closest to settling they historically had going for them was to make huts on the outskirts. There\u2019s no evidence a village with a significant Za\u2019fid population ever existed. Only in recent decades have they been found to settle in populated/civilized areas for more than a year (eg Summer Rose).  \n\n\u2014 Za\u2019fids don\u2019t *traditionally* change their last name when they marry. Also, children take the name of the parent of their respective gender (hence why Taiyang supported Ruby taking Summer\u2019s last name.)\n\n> **Summer Rose (just some fun headcanon backstory I made with all this)**\n\nLiving her youth as a nomad, Summer Rose had been to Vale many times, especially Patch. Yet every time she went, there was an emotion, a sensation, she never got to experience anywhere else: she felt at home. She held onto the memory of that feeling while traveling with her family and decided if she had a chance to settle down, it\u2019d be there. \n\nSummer\u2019s parents were Huntsman, and they took turns between working jobs and parenting the kids. They were reluctantly supportive of her attending Beacon to become a Huntress because (a) they knew first-hand of the risks, most of which were related to the Truculence; and (b) her father would soon have his PhD, so he could\u2019ve given her a license in half the time of an academy. Summer wasn\u2019t rebellious, per se; rather she knew there was more to living life than the mercy of the elements\u2014having seen it for herself among the people her parents helped\u2014and wanted to try her hand at it.\n\nOzpin was one of her professors and was integral in helping her adjust to the \u201cconstantly peaceful\u201d environment. He became Headmaster during Team STRQ\u2019s 4th year. \n\nSummer didn\u2019t tell her team much about her kind. As Qrow bore witness to her death her last words were something along the lines of, \u201cwhen she\u2019s ready, give Ruby something to kill.\u201d \n\nWith their overall lack of knowledge about Za\u2019fid, raising Ruby was a nightmare from age 7-11. The girls don\u2019t remember and nobody talks about this one incident, where Ruby lashed out and KO\u2019d Yang in a fit of Truculence, and how Qrow literally led a Grimm to their house just so Ruby would kill it and come back to normal. But that\u2019s saying too much about another story.\n\n> **Trivia**\n\n\u2014 Za\u2019fid name origins: I selected two Arabic names from [Behind the Name](https://www.behindthename.com/) and combined: Fidda (\u201csilver\u201d), and Zaahir (\u201cto shine, to radiate\u201d)\n\n\u2014 Also I like the idea that Summer hadn\u2019t killed anything in awhile when she got to Beacon, so she tore through many trees and almost killed Taiyang in a Truculence-induced rage during Initiation. And that\u2019s why he hooked up with Raven before her XD"

We see this in other fields as well. Consistently they resist general patterns because their brains work differently and they don't see overall patterns the same way. Even in the research we see Ni types are far more likely to think this way. Also why do you think INFPs consistently see themselves as special unique snowflakes and INTPs constantly say that you can't categorize people with 16 labels? Moving downward from there Fi types push back a lot because of their need for a feeling of self and individuality and if they're \"labeled\" then they don't like it. All of these things are consistent across countries, cultures, and age groups. Yet just because the general patterns aren't perfect down to the micron (Si) they're garbage.

She is unlikable, etc\" ends up being code. \n\nIn 1992, in College English 101, we read an article each week, had a discussion, then wrote an essay on the topic. One week the topic was gender equality. The discussion turned to societal roles. The guys all maintained women had achieved equality, nothing further should be done, and now we were just whining. One lady pointed out there had never been a female president. \n\n\"That's because we can't predict what you'll do with that power,\" one guy said. \"We don't trust you, you might have a bad day and attack Russia.\" \n\nAnother lady tried to convince him his fears were irrational. He replied, \" No woman will ever be elected President. We (men) will never allow it. We won't vote for you. We will crush any woman who tries. You may as well get used to that.\"\n\nDuring all of this, other guys were trying to whisper for him to shut up. Not because they disagreed but because he was not supposed to say it out loud. He told the guys, \"It's important that they know the truth about how the world really works.\"\n\nI think about that every day as I debate running for public office in 5 or so years.",

We do FaceTime/call each other every weekday though. \n\nThe first few months of interacting with my TF brought me through some of the craziest DNOTS moments I have ever experienced. I\u2019m not perfect by any means but I\u2019ve had more personal and spiritual growth in the 1st 6 months of this relationship than I\u2019ve ever had in my entire life. \n\nI feel like the DNOTS dust has settled some in the past couple of months but they are now being replaced with a sort of \u201changover\u201d feeling every Monday. I feel incredibly drained and basically only lie on my couch all day because I really don\u2019t have any more energy to expend for anything else. We don\u2019t really do a whole lot on the weekends even - mainly errands or go to the beach. Sometimes we\u2019ll hang out with his neighbors and drink with them but we rarely get drunk with them, so it\u2019s usually not an actual hangover. And it\u2019s not like we\u2019re packing the weekends with back to back activities, either. We honestly watch a lot of TV and talk about what we want to eat for the day and how messed up this world is, LOL. \n\nHas anyone else felt this way after spending physical time with their twin?\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for the long post!

He knows I usually have the spot of tank in my raiding guild and I think he despises me just for the sake of having it, or maybe he's just envious. If you compare [my profile](https://raider.io/characters/eu/nemesis/Malaachi) with [his profile](https://raider.io/characters/eu/nemesis/Pinturicch%C3%ACo) you can clearly see that he plays just to get the higher score on [raider.io](https://raider.io) and then share it on my guild's discord chat while writing \"YOU SEE GUYS? I DID BEAT HIS SCORE!\" . I have played in season 2 and he has played in season 2, I have played in season 4 and he has played in season 4, and you can see our score are very near, he just plays 11-12 hours a day to get the score higher than mine and then stops playing. If he was a better player I would just acknowledge that and everyone would be ok, but this kind of behavior (in vocal chat with guildies he usually belittles me) stresses me out and makes me not enjoy the game. What should I do? It's not that I can report him, because he doesn't really do anything against the ToS or something like that, but it makes me not enjoy the game, some evenings I would pause a second before entering chat due to his behavior."

If so, people haven't gotten the memo. It causes people to become more \"extreme\" versions of their real-life personas. This breeds hyperbole, sensationalism, dogma, blatant misinformation, and divisive rhetoric of all forms. \n\nThe entire social media \"ecosystem\" rewards tribalist behavior and discourages rationalism or nuanced opinions. Your opinions must be strong, short, and \"permissible.\" Take no look further than your twitter tending section, or r/politics, or FOX/CNN to see these phenomena in action. \n\nWhy? Well my radical theory is that we're mammals, and social media removes all incentive for accountability, sound logic, or decorum. Fighting is the lifeblood. Despite the glaring fact that if everyone took their rage, and instead went to the state polls to elect reps with ACTUAL POWER to restructure the police, this issue would have been solved long ago. Yet rather, many have been duped into thinking that behaving like bath salts zombies is the more \"effective\" and \"modern\" approach to governmental change. Are there no similarities in behavior here with the way the Church or USSR or the Salem Colonists dealt with those who were \"out of line\"? This is not evolution, it's stagnation.\n\nHow to change my view? How have the big SM platforms (Twitter, FB, Instagram) had any net positive sociopolitical impact on improving relations between races?"

To avoid financial entanglement, I took leave from school (would have been a junior in college).  I left behind a lease in my college town that my parents were responsible for and signed a new one, etc.  I have not spoken with my uBPD mother for several weeks and am in contact with my edad and two younger brothers via messages and occasional calls.  My mother was very abusive, physically, emotionally, and financially, throughout my college experience so far and severely restricted my independence.  It's been a relief to finally be able to take care of my mental health and be out of that toxic environment.  \n\nHowever I had a few pets at home that I miss and would love to see again.  I would also love to see my little brothers.  I was thinking about taking a bus back home for a day or two and then bussing back up.  I would probably ask my dad to drive me to and from the bus stop (it is walkable however).  I am just worried that my mother will be destructive toward me and my possessions, as she has done before; if she cuts my credit cards or hides my keys again, that would be very problematic for me.  It does sound like she has changed some of her attitudes since I left, but I can tell from some of my communication with my dad that she has been speaking very negatively regarding me and is still angry with me for the disruptive and messy way in which I escaped.  \n\nFurthermore, I am still in the process of appealing for independence with FAFSA and figuring out how to return to school.  My argument with FAFSA is that I fled an abusive family, which is factually true, but definitely not something I can say to my mom.  I know she will ask me about my plans to go back to school and potentially offer tuition money to me and I feel that in their presence I will lose my strength of will and end up entangled once more.  I also don't want to go back to having to lie to the people around me constantly.  I would much rather be able to be upfront about everything but they are impossible to be upfront with.  \n\nShould I risk it and go back, or continue with basically low contact until my life is more settled?"

I fed it other spiders, bees, wasps, roly polies, and flies, and I thought everything was fun and games.  I thought we were bros.  I did notice that it also became very fat.  In the last two days, it created a super thick, fluffy white web, much like a tube with three openings, in one corner of its enclosure, and then went inside for many hours.  After I provided more flies, the spider left the web, and it is now noticeably thinner.  I peeked into the web from the corner of the enclosure and I see a whitish lump on the inner layer of the tube.  Now, the spider spends nearly all its time hiding and sometimes remodeling the web.  Is this an egg case?  Is it likely to be fertilized?  Have I become the unsuspecting victim of a spider's unplanned pregnancy? xD"

Ideally the car should have enough space to hold a cooler and two or three trash bags worth of stuff, and be pretty low maintenance because I don't know anything about how to repair a car that has broken down and I don't want to spend a lot of money on fixing a broken car.  Kind of silly but I also really like cars that appear to be smiling (round headlights and round body) haha.  What kind of car do you guys recommend looking for?\n\nAnother note, it would be nice if the car has a rearview camera but I don't really care for the automated alert systems that warn you if you're close to other cars.  I learned to drive on a large car but I would prefer a smaller vehicle.  "

I trust all my fellow players, and the DM to \"run\" my character well enough... but still, my characters feel sort of a part of me.. and it would feel just.. weird, if someone else was the one in control of that instead\n\nMy character isn't just a character, he is MY character, I put myself into the character, not to make a copy of myself, but in the same way an artist puts themself into any art, they take time, energy, and a lot of thought to create this thing. I don't think any artist would want someone else to come fill in for them on a day off and start adding to their painting, no matter how skilled or trusted that other artist was.\n\nNow I am not saying that the characters are akin to art, I am just saying there is a very personal connection to the characters, I would never want anyone to run my character just as I would never want to run anyone else's character\n\nIf it was really necessary for my character to be there for an encounter in a non-roleplay capacity, I would prefer if somehow my character sort of.. fell into some sleeping state and was magically animated to be able to fight, but his consciousness was still gone, that way he can maybe function just fine, but since I am not there, neither is he, entirely..\n\nI don't know.. I am rambling lol, but I just thought I would share my opinion for why I don't think I would be super comfortable with it generally\n\nTldr: I feel there is a personal connection between the player and character, and it feels weird, for me, to have that connection removed and turn the character into just a functioning combat piece controlled by everyone else.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add a note, I am relatively new to DnD, so my perspective might be different than someone who has had many characters, and don't feel super attached to any one of them in particular. But I have only had a few so far, so I feel a bit more personally involved with each one of them.",

Hastr0 is listed as co-owner and \"chief gaming officer\", so I'm unsure how much sway he directly has on the budget.\n\nHastr0 has always been big on being competitive, even when he was explaining the decision to let the team explore free agency, he stated that they were \"of course we are going to attempt to put together the best roster for 2023, and hopefully that roster includes many of the players we have now\", followed by stating that their goal is to bring home another championship. \n\nHastr0 doesn't seem like the type of guy to say all this if he knew big budget changes were incoming, seems to me like its more of a h3cz decision. \n\nOnce again though, this is just my own speculation. Best case scenario is that Rush actively wanted MCD and Unique as replacements for Fielder and Chiyo, and that Fuel genuinely tried to remain competitive with their budget.",

Who\u2019s to say they won\u2019t start that same thing with him? \n\nMy in-laws have issues where they are good with our kids in short bursts but as soon as 24 hours have passed, they revert to the kind of people they were when my husband was little. Terrible parents don\u2019t grow into better people when they become grandparents. More often they get worse because now they are old and tired. So now consider how three days of Disneyland will go when everyone is an adult except the 7 year old. Think they\u2019ll go on the rides he wants? Think they\u2019ll give up their time to do the things he wants? I doubt it. Using my in-laws as an example again, when we all go to Disneyland together, we always have to eat where my MIL wants to eat. She won\u2019t eat at the fun kid places. It\u2019s got to be the nice sit down places where there\u2019s hardly anything a kid really wants. And she doesn\u2019t listen to what the kids want but rather tries to convince them that they want to do what she wants to do. \n\nAnd even if they were the best grandparents in the world, I\u2019ll bet your son would really miss you guys not being there, especially after 3 days. \n\nI suggest telling them they either pay for you and your husband also or no deal. It\u2019s inappropriate for them NOT to pay for you but to still pay for others.",

You cannot submit a tax return digitally/electronically if you need to obtain the ITIN using the W7 form.\n\nThis is directly from the W7 instructions. Make sure it applies to you. If it doesn't then you don't have to worry about it. The law changed.\n\n\"Allowable tax benefit. For tax years after December 31, 2017,\n\nspouses and dependents are NOT eligible for an ITIN or to\n\nrenew an ITIN unless they are claimed for an allowable tax\n\nbenefit or they file their own tax return. Spouses and dependents\n\nmust be listed on an attached U.S. federal tax return and include\n\nthe schedule or form that applies to the allowable tax benefit. An\n\nallowable tax benefit includes a spouse filing a joint return, head\n\nof household (HOH), American opportunity tax credit (AOTC),\n\npremium tax credit (PTC), child and dependent care credit\n\n(CDCC), or credit for other dependents (ODC).\"\n\n[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw7.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw7.pdf)\n\n==================================\n\nIn my case, my monies were non-taxable and I only filed just to show I filed. I only claimed a dollar. The reason behind that is because a lot of businesses will ask you for your taxes and if you didn't do taxes, then they want a affidavit stating that you didn't do your taxes. It is just easier to show the dollar then to fabricate what they need.\n\nI filed Married Filing Separately. My wife did not work. She is not a green card holder nor does she have an ITIN number. She would have no need to file. She made below the $5.\n\nAccording to this website. She doesn't have to file anything. I don't know your situation and how much money was made between you two. This is just my situation.\n\n[https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return)\n\n==========================================================\n\nI used my mother's desktop in the Untied States since its using an US IP address. I am not sure how tax programs work. It was just the safest bet. I used TeamViewer to do it.\n\nI did the taxes using TurboTax on my mom's computer. I printed out the 1040s at the end of filing because I had to do a paper file. I printed the papers in a PDF. Then, I sent the papers to my computer here in Colombia.\n\nYou are going to have to print out the W-7s where you are at and fill them out and then sign at the bottom. You are also going to have to include documentation like a passport. I am here in Colombia and when I thought I had to get a ITIN number. I made a copy of her passport and her National ID card and had her notarize those copies. then, you can scan them into a PDF file. Send it to your friend and include that along with your Federal Tax returns.\n\nYou have three options:\n\n1. Use a digital signature. I used Adobe Acrobat to achieve this. Put your signature and date on the paperwork. Save it and then send it back to your friends house in US to have those sheets printed out with your signature on it. then, have it mailed out. This is the best way because it doesn't hurt the integrity of the papers or signature if you were to scan them back in as you would with method 2.\n2. You can print out the PDF file and use wet ink. Rescan it back into the computer and then send it back to your friends to have it mailed out.\n3. Print out the forms where you are and then use a delivery courier like FedEx or DHL and have them send it directly to IRS to process. Not the most guaranteed and the most expensive.\n\nMy mother sent out my documents today and she told me that it cost her $16 dollars each, one to federal and the other to state,  which included a tracking number and return receipt (on the safe side) using USPS.",

She does not have a SSN or ITIN.\n\nMarried, Nov 9th, 2021\n\nAll my monies are non-taxable. I make more than 3x the Minimum Requirement for the 125% Poverty Level. Monies are from VA and SSA. I can produce Award Letters for both.\n\nThe last three taxes I filed:\n\n2019: AGI $1, Filed Single\n\n2020: AGI $1, Filed Single\n\n2021: AGI $1, Filed Single, This was the mistake.\n\n2022: AGI$1, Will file MFS, Neither Me or Wife made taxable Income\n\nMy issue is that I accidently filed Single for my 2021 taxes. On Tuesday, I am sending in the 1040X to amend those taxes. It was a mistake because I thought that because my wife was not a resident or had a SSN, then she would not be counted. I found out recently that you must file married even so. A mistake I am paying for and learning from. I am also sending the 1040X to State as well.\n\nI am also going to send in my 2022 Federal Taxes and 2022 State Taxes. They have to be sent by paper because without an SSN or ITIN, they won't send them digitally. \n\nAnother issue that I am having is that I was told it can take up to 14 weeks for a 1040X to take affect.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*NVC\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nJust had my case sent to NVC and they are going to require income proof. \n\nWould it be possible to avoid sending them my 1040s or tax transcript because they only show $1 and its moot. They will still want me to send them more proof that I make money to support the I-864.\n\nCan I just explain in a letter that I did file for taxes and my mistake and then provide them with Retirement Award letters and bank statements to satisfy the I-864? or Should I explain in a letter what happen and also send them the 1040X and tracking number for the paperwork going to the IRS to prove to them I fix the issue? I don't think the paperwork will be ready to file because I need to get NVC completed before the 14 weeks.\n\nI have award letters from VA and SSA showing I make enough. Then, I can also provide bank statements of my account receiving those funds. If that doesn't work, then I can get a backup sponsor. I just don't want to put that backup sponsor in a situation that they don't need to be in unless it is in a dire emergency. I would rather just the I-864 fall solely on me, but if I need to have someone sponsor, then it would be a last resort.\n\nIf you were in my situation, how would you go about submitting this information to NVC to satisfy their needs?\n\nThank You in Advance."

If a child is raised in a religion and told they will go to hell and be ostracized from their family if they don't go to church, when they reach adulthood they may \"choose\" to keep going to church but we aren't insulting them by saying that's not an uninfluenced choice. It's also not a failing to have not critically examined a part of life you took as fact, we all have things to learn and unlearn. \n\nOf course makeup can be used for self expression, but the kind we're discussing, as related to the original post about corporations profiting off self hate and beauty standards, signifies nothing. No one is buying primers and powders to make their skin appear airbrushed it isn't to denote some truth about themselves.  It's because they have been inundated with the idea that women should not have pores.\n\nThis is not an attack on women. It's a... zoom out. So that when a woman stings her legs bc she shaved right before she went in the ocean, we don't just see, oh she made a \"bad choice\" with negative consequences. Or, she knew she would be thinking about the stubble visible on her legs all day, so she wanted to shave, so it's a \"good choice\". It's, she, like all women (and men) have been indoctrinated throughout life with unnatural (literally) standards for how a woman should appear. \n\nThen, we are presented with the weighted choice of perpetuating the standards, or breaking them to try to lighten the pressure and make the choice less weighted for others. Our own personal choices are not the only methods of change. But the factors, and consequences, are all there, acknowledged or not.",

Now take this edible dark mark that doesn't work, go fetch!\" And I go, \"Okaaay!\" and I go over to the Green House and go, \"Can I wit gift please?\" and they go \"NO!\" And I go, \"Okaaay!\" And they go, \"You\"re a little muggle, aren't you?\" And I go, \"Nooo,\" and they go, \"SAY IT!\" and I go, \u201cI'm a little muggle.\" And then I go over to the Niantic support bot, which is an oxymoron, and I go, \"Can you please fix this task?\" and they go \"No! In fact, we're gonna force you to restart the game, and you're gonna be glitched out of the knight bus for thirty years!\" And I go, \"Why are you doing this to me?!\" And they go, \"Because we're Niantic gaming, and life is a fucking nightmare!\"\n\nBut with this subreddit, someone will just be like, \"Here's a screenshot on the official forum, and they've said they're looking into the problem.\" So it's better."

People who choose to do sex work are entitled to do so. \n\nAnd of course my opinion on the harmful nature of transactional sex is forged mostly from anecdotes of those close to me and strangers I\u2019ve talked to. Since I\u2019m not advocating any state interference, I don\u2019t see why my personal dislike for the industry is problematic. \n\nMy stance is: It appears prostitution tends to be tied to shunning and unwanted social phenomena, so it seems like a society that encourages finding alternatives to the industry, or replaces it entirely, is preferable to one that does not actively seek to confront the issues of the industry. If I\u2019m wrong, power to the red light districts!",

It sounds like you\u2019re equating consensual casual sex to sex work. \n\nAlso you stated that demand determines value by stating that sex work is valuable because it is in demand. I agree that entertainment is important, but I don\u2019t think entertainment should come at the (perceived) cost of the entertainer to fulfill market demand. \n\nI\u2019m just sharing my view, not advocating legislation.",

Maybe, I think that's a highly subjective issue, but personally I think that it harms the self image of the individual, makes them predisposed to shunning, and objectivises them.\n\nThe question in my eyes isn't wether prostitution is work, but wether that work is desirable. It is desirable under capitalism, because there is demand, but I think in a humanitarian society we have to reanalyse wether value of work is determined by its demand, or its constructiveness towards human well-being. If society and work isn't here for us to support eachother, what's the point, you know?",

Whenever you feel like you want to relapse/do it again, keep this in mind: \n\n- Allah is watching.\n\n\nAlso whenever you feel like you wanna relapse, directly go listen to Qur'an. If you can read Arabic, I recommend you reading it. \n\nI recommend listen to Sheikh Abdul Basit Abdul Samad, he's got an amazing voice. \n\n\n\nI recommended listening to Qur'an because whenever I listen to Qur'an, a miraculous feeling strikes my heart, I directly feel calm and warm from the inside and it makes me forget all my problems. \n\n\nStay positive y'all and may Allah bless and guide you all! \n\n\nAstaghfirullah."

You\u2019re getting \u201cpaid\u201d in the fruits of society\u2019s labor. And every industry should be non-profit because we\u2019re only producing enough to meet our needs. \n\nNow, would money be obliterated overnight? No, modern socialists societies still use money. As for your other question, I believe the USSR had a slogan of \u201cfrom each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution\u201d as long as the individual was able-bodied and able to work. While  different from Marx\u2019s \u201ceach according to his needs\u201d, that slogan highlights that we will, collectively, need to make decisions that may not look like communism\u2019s final goal, but are always considering the current material reality and making decisions that benefit the proletariat. Case in point, that slogan acknowledges there were not enough resources or infrastructure in Russia to provide everyone with what they needed. It also acknowledges that not every proletariat had enough class consciousness to accept working less desirable for \u201cno\u201d reward. So we have a compromise that encourages the worker to provide for society and helps Russia increase its production in order to get to a point where it can provide for everyone\u2019s needs. Once that point is met, it would have to re-analyze the current situation and make decisions based the available information, history, and the interests of the proletariat vs the bourgeoisie.",

No money for tuition/licensing or cannot afford to live in an area with adequate schools). Furthermore, the job market is dictated by what is profitable for the bourgeoisie/petty bourgeoisie so a would-be artist may have to work in accounting simply because art isn\u2019t profitable. \n\nIn a communist society, a would-be scientist would only be limited by the needs of society. If there are enough scientists to accomplish socially necessary tasks, the worker would need to do another job. Now, that being said, science and art are interesting in that we think of them as these specialized careers, but they aren\u2019t always. \n\nIf a farmer, for example, observes a certain phenomenon among plants then tests, records, and analyzes that data to confirm their hypothesis: would that farmer not also be a scientist? If a farmer arranges flowers in a particularly pleasing pattern or, in their leisure time, paints the fields, are they not an artist? \n\n>Would communist workers simply apply for their jobs or would their jobs be assigned to them by the government? \n\nI don\u2019t see why they couldn\u2019t apply. I\u2019d imagine postings would be limited to what is needed at the time. Though, I don\u2019t know if jobs would be on an as needed, contract basis (Ex. a farm needs more workers during the harvest season) or if their would be long-term roles as well (Ex. A hospital has x amount of doctors unless needed somewhere else). \n\nI\u2019m sure the government would encourage certain skills/industries through the education system if there were shortages or perhaps provide some non-monetary incentive for less desirable jobs (extra leisure time, a ration of a rarer good, public recognition of service). Likewise, if certain individuals showed a knack for an area, the government or other individuals might encourage them to go for certain roles.",

But they stayed together all those years! I unfortunately lost the save file where I was as his daughter :( \n-Bobby: I made my boyfriend and I in the Sims and had him adopt a kid. Bobby was the cutest fucking toddler I\u2019ve ever seen. He came to us with a wittle floppy hat and rain boots. I never wanted to age him up :( I\u2019m mad that I also lost that file. \n\n-For Sims 3 recently, I started a legacy challenge. This woman just wanted a nice man to start her life with. Her first love interest showed up to the date with his mistress and then told my Sim she was the one who had a problem. Okay dude. Whatever he was a total lazy slob and she\u2019s super active. Then, she went on a date with this really nice cop who she met at the gym! Turns on he was a werewolf and he literally transformed before the date really even started. She saw him a few times after that at parties, but he was always inviting a bunch of other girls and when she tried to flirt with him, they all got mad. Yeah, we\u2019re not playing that game. So she finally goes for this fairy guy because if she has to choose between a broke werewolf who she\u2019s terrified of versus the douchy fairy whose super rich and famous but also has her same interests, well, love don\u2019t pay the bills. Werewolf cop still invites her to all of his parties. She still thinks about him from time to time. Fairy guy started treating her good after they got married so it\u2019s a tough choice. And they had fun on their honeymoon in France so all is well? Maybe? \n\nAlso, she totally spent one of her lifeguard shifts chasing a wild horse. She will tame him. Someday.",

It\u2019s different depending on my mood and level of fear that day, but I usually try to appear in a way that either cannot provoke sexual feelings or that would cause society to say, \u201cew, you were attracted to that?\u201d It\u2019s a protective measure. I feel I either have a responsibility to avoid provoking sexual feelings or to set myself up as a perfect victim so I can have justice. \n\nI really have difficulty with not self-blaming. I see being assaulted the same as carrying too much money in my wallet and being robbed or leaving my keys in my car. Those are things I would think, \u201cwow, what an idiot. If you\u2019re that stupid, you deserve to be taken advantage of.\u201d \n\nWhich is the root of the issue. I almost feel like strong people have a right over the weak. That if you show your vulnerability someone stronger will obviously hone in on it. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I think predators shouldn\u2019t be punished, it\u2019s that I believe predators are natural and ever-present so it seems irresponsible to not protect yourself. \n\nAnd that belief is honestly taking the joy out of all areas of my life. It creates this anxiety to be perfect all of the time. Self-inflicted hyper vigilance. I\u2019ve talked to my therapist a little on this, but unlike some of my other unhealthy thought patterns, this one seems like it will take years to get rid of. Because when I allow myself to be vulnerable, whether by wearing a certain kind of underwear or asking for help when I need it, I have no way to cope if that leads to something bad. \n\n\u201cYou have no control over what others think or do.\u201d We do to an extent. We choose our words, mannerisms, and appearances to convince people to do or think things everyday. Politics, job interviews, dates etc. So it feels possible to control if someone will choose me as a victim by appearing less victim-like. The problem is am I living my life to the fullest by putting myself on guard? No, I\u2019m definitely not. And despite my efforts, it could still happen. After all, I\u2019m still a 5\u2019 2\u201d woman. Even with working out or carrying a weapon, I\u2019m no match against someone with 100lbs and at least half a foot on me. \n\nHow do you deal with feeling so vulnerable? What do you say or do to free yourself of that burden and just LIVE?"

I can actually take a moment to use a coping mechanism now to help my emotional regulation.

There might be some exceptions where the description actually fits one's personality solely by chance, but that's pretty rare.

But oh wait, she was born at 00:01 on April 20th, she must be a Taurus therefore super lazy!\"\n\n...like really? You can't instantly know someone just by their birthdays, something they can't choose. It's kinda like saying \"you're a girl, so you must really like shopping\" or \"you're a guy, so you must really like playing sports\".\n\nThe even dumber thing is those women who go on tv every week to do some FoRtUnE tElLiNg about the signs. \"Oh no, Mercury is very angry! Capricorns might get hit by a car this week, so look out!\"\n\n(I come from a family who believes in signs and won't shut up about it, so I have a lot of opinions on this topic)\n\nI respect it if you believe it but claiming it's real?

As you've probably guessed from the title, I'm moving to Germany in about a year or two, but I'm not sure how it will turn out.\n\nMy parents and ancestors are all European, however, I was born in a middle eastern country and I know a bit about racism towards people with middle eastern/Asian backgrounds in germany.\n\nI'm moving there for academic purposes, and I won't go there until I'm fluent in German and familiar with the culture, laws, etc. I will try my best to integrate completely and not cause any problems there.\n\nBut as I said before, I'm a bit scared about the reactions I will get there. Some people say germans are pretty nice people if you're not causing any problems, but some others say that they are verrrry nationalists and attack you for your nationality no matter what you do. (the city I'm planning to move to is in the west) I would really appreciate it if a german citizen can confirm or debunk these rumors, thank you!\n\nand an extra question: would it be considered rude to not have a perfect accent despite being fluent in german? I generally don't have a problem with the accent, but I can't pronounce some of the words since my throat structure isn't really appropriate for it.

If there is a tie, both episodes are eliminated. This will continue until only one episode is left standing!

Here are some of the big ones in my opinion:\n\n1. First Plot Point (Doors of No Return) - Kendall\u2019s crash kills the waiter and he begins to grapple with it. (1/4 way through)\n2. Midpoint - Kendall publicly turns against Logan and blames him for the cruise scandal. (1/2 way through)\n3. Third Plot Point (Dark Night of the Soul) - Kendall breaks down in front of his siblings and they find that Logan is taking away Waystar from their grasp. (3/4 way through)\n\nTo me, the show\u2019s timing of these moments looks very much like a full story structure. 1 should be the protagonist crossing a threshold and Kendall does, beginning to grapple with so much more about himself following his involvement in the crash. 2 should be the protagonist fulfilling their want but not their need and is, with Kendall acting the killer his father wants him to be and getting closer to having Waystar but not getting any closer to reconnecting with himself. 3 should be a true low point for the protagonist and is, with Ken breaking down and even attempting suicide. \n\nI believe that this all points strongly in favor of a 4 season arc given where the plot points line up. Anyone agree or think otherwise?"

All of a sudden, both standalone VSTi I wanted to use are having several issues. I'm using Minimogue VA and an Arp Solina, both are free and very simple. I have a Dell laptop with Windows 10 installed. \n\nHere's what happened: today I saved some presets to use during the gig. I had saved some other presets before too. Everything was okay and I was practicing this afternoon. I decided to put desktop shortcuts of both .exe files to make it easier to use. Then the Solina software simply stopped working properly and now it just sounds like piano. (???)\n\nThe minimoog .exe still sounds like it should, but it just won't load any saved preset, and I can't save new presets either. Yesterday it was working fine. I even deleted the VSTs and downloaded them again. But somehow the same preferences were saved and nothing changed.\n\nNow I have literally one day to solve this problem or I'll just have to find a way to do the gig with my Nord only. Any ideas? Has anyone else had similar problems?\n\nThanks."

Since last year, my individual practice has become more steady. I acquired more resistance to longer periods of silent meditation and I feel like, as I get deeper into the practice, everything else in my life also changes - for much better!\n\nSo I definitely want to make it a constant through my life. I usually seek to meditate at least 30 minutes a day, though it's not always possible. But I still struggle with keeping the discipline. One problem is that I don't always have much time to make longer sessions. \n\nThe other is that, at least in Zen Buddhism, there's much focus on the *right way* of meditating - that is, in silence, looking at a blank wall, alternating zazen with kinhin etc. But it's almost impossible for me to do exactly this way every time. I feel pain in my shoulders, in my legs, in my back. And I do practice physical activities. When I'm home it's alright, because I can just stretch a bit during the practice and then go back to samadhi. But with other people... No.\n\nSo I wonder if it's okay to change the meditation position, try other ways of doing it. I'm also curious about how much time you take for meditation, which techniques do your use the most, to which traditions the techniques are related etc. \n\nThanks a lot ! Gassho \ud83d\ude4f"

So far the impression I have is that the female people in his life are quite well-treated.

Told me they\u2019re very close and there only happen the eventual \u2018nagging/lecturing/disagreement\u2019 between them. \nHe doesn\u2019t have many female friends, but the one he told me about, he seemed to cherish her a lot and value her pride in being a woman (so much he called out his \u2018stupid friend\u2019 many times after breaking her heart when they were in a relationship). \n\nAgain, these are just words. If he is indeed scamming me or trying to use me as a means to a goal, he\u2019d have anything and everything planned out. One can never be sure that what is told online is 100% factual. Still, this is what I have, his words. So I\u2019ll take it with a grain of salt and build all which he says into pieces so it may fit into the puzzle, and wonder when anything won\u2019t align. \u201cSus/gut feeling\u201d.\n\nThank you very much for your input!",

If we liked each other enough, perhaps we could wait until we are both outside of university to go live in the same place. Not necessarily marry or live in the same house, but have each other near so the \u201creal compatibility task\u201d is put to test. \n\nTo your last questions, I think I would be okay with breaking up while still \u2018waiting\u2019 online. Breaking up after closing the gap (by marriage or anything  else which is very compromising such as living together) just seems like a mess, and emotional wreckage. \n\nAll that I say in here sounds indecisive, because that is the truth. I would not think of marriage before 30. At 18, there is so much growing-up I have to do. There are still so many goals I want to achieve (preferably alone) before I commit to a lifelong relationship like marriage.\n\nOne thing I already know about his culture is that women can\u2019t divorce easily like men can if not at all. This boy told me he\u2019s more easygoing and liberal towards the Islamic rules (and I believe that because he has told me he isn\u2019t an exact rule-follower). Still, family would always be an issue for \u2018an outsider\u2019 like me. Kind of playing/gambling against the odds. \n\nThank you so much for your comment. I read everything that was in the website\u2019s page, and it is truly enlightening. I am not going there for shit now. I\u2019ll communicate with him what he thinks about coming to Europe as it will be safe for him in here. There, I will have the thought that I am unsafe at all times on the back of my head. Sounds quite unfair, doesn\u2019t it? That I\u2019d need to jeopardize my freedom by going there while he wouldn\u2019t coming in here. \n\nIf you have any other questions, please ask them. Tbh I am a little clueless still. This is the first \u201crelationship\u201d (if it can be called that) I\u2019ve been in, so there are many doubts and whys in between.",

Dat is wat uw persoonlijkheid zal bepalen) voordat u begint met het invullen van de enqu\u00eate, is ongeveer 10 minuten. Het kan maximaal 15-20 minuten duren, afhankelijk van de leessnelheid en zelfbewustzijn.\n\nAlvast bedankt voor het lezen en het invullen van deze 16p test en enqu\u00eate.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgYA8DEDbqD-HubCy35\\_V8NPVzuVUl0w7a8wh5vAPk2liAXA/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgYA8DEDbqD-HubCy35_V8NPVzuVUl0w7a8wh5vAPk2liAXA/viewform?usp=sf_link)"

And despite the fact that no real link has been demonstrated there was actually a huge badger culling operation a few years ago which devastated the badger population and had no impact whatsoever on TB. The areas with and without culling had no significant difference and in a lot of cases the culling actually seemed to be potentially increasing the bovine TB (although this wasn't certain and obviously they didn't test the theory because they didn't want more TB if they were right). \n\nI understand you may be frustrated, but the badgers aren't the scapegoat you think they are. I also think it should be relatively clear that large governmental organisations organising farming economics and farming welfare are going to want to save cow farming at all costs and are in fact not going to be biased towards or even remotely swayed by small organisations aiming to save badgers. If culling all the badgers would work, they would have done it. You can't pretend they wouldn't, because they tried it and only stopped because it wasn't helping and may have been making things worse. \n\nAlso ethically I do think yes it is a bit dubious to suggest that badger genocide is justifiable, dire as the circumstances may be.\n\nThe badgers don't have more rights than people, last time I checked they've never allowed large culling operations for people. And the correct disposal of infected animals is decided by experts in disease management that have decades of research and learning to go off of, while the decisions may not make sense to you it does seem a bit presumptuous to suggest that you know better and that sending the animals to slaughter as normal would be perfectly fine (I can see many clear and immediate problems with allowing mass transport of infected animals to places that have heavy back and forth contact with numerous local and regional farms). \n\nTB is also zoonotic, you don't want it to infect more animals or humans than is strictly necessary in order to reduce spread. And any animal tested positive for TB can be admitted into the food chain, after an individual inspection by a veterinary surgeon. The logistics and money involved with paying an expert to cut open each individual cow after slaughter and inspect the lungs and other tissues would make the whole endeavour a massive hassle and generally unviable. There aren't enough experts free to do that all day and paying them would take up most of the profits anyway. Not to mention the added biosecurity precautions necessary for such an undertaking which would also be expensive.\n\nI get it's frustrating. But you're blaming people (and badgers) for an act of nature, it's a disease. TB doesn't have a personal vendetta against you, and neither do the government or the badgers.",

Some parasites for example can live for many months outside of a host and therefore could infect anything being stored there, or be a threat to the lambs if brought in with anything stored.\n\nFarming different animals require very different facilities and it is also not likely that it would be viable and certainly not convenient for other purposes on a farm. I'm a vet student, and the amount of consideration that goes into designing these buildings and the regulations regarding them is clearly not something you're familiar with.

It seems rather daft considering I'm sure the closest village will likely have a Tesco express or something the claim that it will undermine local business is not particularly well founded nor would it be reasonable if it were, why would a different local business get precedence over a new shop selling the same thing? And the labouring over roof tiles is a bit daft, without knowing it was a point of contention there's no way a reasonable person would drive past and notice the roof as being obtrusive and in conflict with the surroundings. \n\nYour point about the time of year was also rather pedantic and silly, yes there may technically be dry periods during winter but they're incredibly unpredictable and as such not very useful for the purposes of changing roofing. Contractors can't turn up at the drop of a hat as soon as there is a dry day and planning for it more than a week in advance isn't possible during the winter.\n\nI also think that you lack any basic understanding of the infrastructure necessary for these things as your post flip flops between complaining that there isn't enough parking available to complaining that they want an excessive amount (based on poor calculations, what if everyone at the restaurant takes a different car and the shop is also at capacity?). Car parking should not be capped at the average, it should be the expected absolute maximum and then a bit more. It beggars belief that you saw no contradiction in your arguments when placing \"70 car spaces is excessive\" next to \"they clearly massively underestimated the number of cars and need way more spaces\". \n\nRegarding the effect on the surrounding area with light pollution and just affecting the AONB, I have lived in rural North Yorkshire, widely regarded as being one of the most picturesque regions of the country. And there are plenty of restaurants and pubs and cafes in the middle of nowhere that have absolutely no detrimental affect on the overall beauty. Not once have I looked at one and tutted in disdain that it ruined a nice hill. In fact unless I'm specifically trying to find that restaurant in question I wouldn't even be likely to take any notice of it. It's a restaurant, it's not like he's suggested a shopping centre. I seriously doubt you'd have to look far to find a comparable restaurant. \n\nThe attempted to discredit bias are also very one sided (as is the whole post) and seem to blatantly disregard the sudden change in discourse that occured after the filming and distribution of the show, which somehow you claim to have done conveniently with examples taken exclusively from before the show was filmed and distributed. It really does look to me like after the show aired the responses seem to be directly influenced by the show. You could argue that bias against him could be reasonable in the circumstances but I'm not accepting \"there is no bias\". \n\nThis post has not done anything to disprove the assumptions made by most people, myself included, that objection was primarily due to NIMBYism. If anything, this post pretty much confirms that, verging on the point of proof considering that the objections are primarily \"I like the field the way it is\" and \"I don't want a building where I can see it/ where I drive past\".\n\nOther minor issues like \"you can't fix the carpark because you got the road muddy and it still won't help\" (this one in particular seems bizarre, if you're complaining of a muddy road (it's a farming region this is going to be half the roads due to tractors but I guess they don't have a problem when it's a tractor even though tractors are far worse) then how can you also be against fixing the problem?). They seem to betray a general fussiness over non existent issues and NIMBYism.\n\nI'm aware that you didn't actually say all of these points yourself and were often quoting others, but considering that you offered comments disputing things you agreed or disagreed with I think it's fair to consider that you have implied that the quotes you used and didn't disagree with are at least reasonable.",

                "body": "So I realise that neoterics are meant to be unique because they break the rules and use magic in a weird way. But to me it seems that's just a very 1 dimensional explanation, clearly if something is doable by magic it could potentially be replicated. And it seems to me that Neoterics are only that way because they lacked a formal education and so don't encounter the rules that ordinary mages place on themselves, which to me seem to be artifacts of prior education.\n\nMages learn to think of how they're performing magic in a certain way because that's how the previous mages thought of that discipline, and presumably how the original person to use that magic thought about how they were causing if to happen and the 'rules' are essentially just limitations of the imagination.\n\nClearly teleporters are capable of contactless teleportation (teleporting someone or something else without touching it) as Nero is, it's something that can be performed using magic. And Fletcher himself does something very similar in Mortal Coil when he teleports the Remnants to Mcgillicudy Reeks using Vals's necromancer fog as a way to connect them all together. But I think that this is less of a physical need for the connection and more of a psychological trick, he needs to understand that they are touching in order to understand how he can teleport them all together. But similarly to considerations used in elemental magic, people are always connected by particles all the time as the air between us is touching like a series of interlocking gears. We are connected but people just don't think of it like that.\n\nUsing that logic, presumably if Fletcher realised this and perhaps with a bit of practice he should theoretically already be capable of doing what Nero does. He already subconsciously makes distinction between which objects he teleport and which he doesn't, for example he takes his clothes with him but not the room or the carpet or any furniture he's touching. He's capable of subconsciously distinguishing between which objects he wants to take with him and those he doesn't regardless of the fact he's touching all of them. Which means that theoretically not only could he teleport other people withiut being in contact with them, he could teleport without someone physically touching him which makes teleporters even more powerful by a wide margin as you can no longer take them hostage the way we've seen in the series.\n\nDoes anyone else agree? Or are them some problems I'm not seeing because it's something I've always assumed Fletcher could do if he tried ever since Mortal Coil but he claims its impossible when he meets Nero. Which I don't think is the case."

Without the AED in the the mix, only way to come out ahead would be to be a better player (which, if you can't tell, I wasn't).\n\nThings like L3 gears, vehicles, sniper/DMR, hard-covers etc are visible to the enemies to make their own decision of how (not) to play. But a deus ex machina item in my inventory that they can never know about doesn't allow the same level of fairness.\n\nIf I have to take any learning from this, it'd be \"***always assume enemies to have AED***\"; and if more people gradually get the same takeaway, they would increasingly choose not to push aggressively like this - making for a very boring & passive gameplay as the best tactical move for both sides.",

                "body": "Yellow errbody, this isn't Purge. Welcome to my guide on efficiency in Dark Moon mod.\n\n**TL;DR:** *You can play Dark Moon in two distinct ways to maximize what you get in return compared to how much efforts you give. One is to get most points for the spin, one is to win till 15th round for the trophy. And no, they're not the same thing.*\n\n---\n\n## Get most points for the Spin\n\nThis is the mode you should be playing most often (that means, once everyday). It's incredibly easy for what it returns; and it doesn't matter you're playing solo ~~with plebs~~ in pubs, or have friends' stack who want the same thing - MOAR DUCK MUUN PTS!\n\n- Get Disruptor, Dark Seer, or Underlord.\n- Stay Alive (phase boots, salves - more on this later)\n- Get till the chicken level, accumulate gold\n- Then you can afford to lose the game.\n\nYes, the 6x multiplier will not be used to full potential, but you just got 35000 Dark Moon points in 10mins, you can go back to playing regular Dota 2, normal or ranked. Make sure you spin for the day's drop.\n\n**You can do this ONCE EVERY DAY, and you should.**\n\n---\n\n## Win all the rounds for the profile trophy\n\nOkay, this is hard. And this is very reliant on the combined skill bracket of the team. Ideally you want to stack with people you can communicate with. I'm posting  *ONE OF THE* compositions, builds and play styles to defeat final boss. This is *NOT THE ONLY WAY*. If you happen to know other ways to reliably win the game, please comment, I'll update the post with attribution.\n\n### THE TEAM & BUILDS\n- **Phantom Assassin:** high DPS single target\n  - ~~Abilities: 3-1-1-1 > 4-4-1-1 > 4-4-4-3, start with Dagger~~\n  - Abilities: 3-1-1-1 > 4-1-4-1 > 4-4-4-3, start with Dagger (courtesy: u/thepellow)\n  - Your job is to live, spam dagger, blink in out and kite for first 5 levels\n  - Next 5 levels, you go on the tankiest of opponents, and delete them ASAP\n  - Last 5 levels are mostly tanky bosses (including Invoker) that's when you shine the most\n  - Core Items: stout + salves > Phase + Battlefury > Satanic > Bloodthorn\n  - Optional Items: Batterfly, MKB, Moon Shard, Heart, BKB\n  - Don't get basher/abyssal, the DPS is very low to be useful for you. Sniper's MKB ministun is way more effective.\n  - Butterfly on PA may seem like a waste, but 67% evasion is insane, when you're tanking in late game; also the AS and Damage.\n\n- **Sniper:** high attack speed spread damage\n  - Abilities: 3-1-1-1, 4-2-2-1, 4-4-4-3, start with Shrapnel\n  - Your job is to live, and farm the key item (maelstorm) ASAP\n  - You are very effective from level 6-10 and primary source of most damage.\n  - Level 11-15 you fall off a bit, but now you can buy damage items for single target.\n  - Core Items: boot + salves > phase boot + gloves > Maelstorm > Mjollnir > Deso > MKB\n  - Optional Items: Bloodthorn, Moon Shard\n  - You give Mjollnir active to PA in later part of the game when she's tanking. You should Hit the same target with high AS.\n  - You're a glass cannon, so make sure to position well and not get sneezed on by the bosses. Reviving is tough in late game.\n\n- **Underlord:** offlane, tank, aura support\n  - Abilities: 3-1-1 > 4-1-4-1 > 4-4-4-3, start with Firestorm\n  - You make sure others dont' die for taking too much damage\n  - Till level 5 you farm and hold a solo lane (right hand side/bottom lane)\n  - Later levels, connect the lanes together around the outer shrine area an be with team\n  - Core Items: Vanguard > Phase + Vlads > Crimson Guard > Heart\n  - Optional Items: Blademail, Pipe, Solar Crest\n  - You're the one who kites and connects the waves - it's very important to make sure they don't go base.\n\n- **Disruptor:** crowd control, farm acceleration, wave clear\n  - Abilities: 3-1-1-1 > 4-4-1-1 > 4-4-4-3, start with Thunder\n  - Early level you wave clear with thunderclap, you also use glimpse to fix a mis-connect wave\n  - Later levels you use Kinetic field and Storm to silence the bosses for your carries to finish them off\n  - You're most useful in level 5 and 10 - farming levels. All your abilities work on the chickens - KA-CHING FOR DAYS!\n  - Core Items: boot + salves > phase > Bloodthorn > BKB\n  - Optional Items: Glimmer, Greaves, Force Staff, Octarine Core. Buy salves and wards as needed.\n  - You make sure the boss PA goes for is controlled/silenced\n\n- **Winter Wyvern:** healer/escape, wave clear and connect, boss controller\n  - Abilities: 1-2-2-1 > 1-4-4-1 > 4-4-4-3, start with Splinter\n  - Use splinter blast to clear waves and cold embrace to heal allies\n  - Use arctic burn to make people escape stick situations (you can cast on allies)\n  - You can also connect waves together and cage them bottom-left highgrounds and fly out\n  - Core Items: boots + salves > Arcane > Mek > Bloodthorn (at least 3 BT in team)\n  - Optional Items: Radiance, Greaves, Octarine Core, Solar Crest. Buy salves and wards as needed.\n\n### STRATEGY\n\n- The trick is to play like the Spartans in the movie *300* (Battle of Thermopylae).\n  - Kite and connect the waves together at the choke-points and kill them with AOE damage (hint: outer shrine, with the highground is awesome spot).\n  - Almost always focus the empowering boss instead of their summons (Dazzle, Nyx, Warlocks etc.)\n- NEVER. LEAD. THE. WAVES. TO. BASE.\n  - Sorry for shouting... can't `<em>` enough. People keep making this mistake.\n  - The base is not fountain (as in normal Dota), you just make your throne vulnerable by doing so\n  - Kite them around the river and high ground, and control their progression with Pit of Malice and Kinetic Field.\n- Also, make sure to use the fortification as many times as possible, as each outer towers will give one fortification.\n  - Ideally, give the fortification, shrine activation, kiting-pathway job to Wyvern\n- Death is costly, way more than it is in Dota 2.\n  - That's one of the reason you're making Phase Boots (to not get stuck in waves). Phase and GTFO.\n  - Wyvern should heal when low, and Disruptor should glimmer to make escape without getting caught.\n  - Ideally Sniper, Wyvern and Disruptor (in that order) should never stay in melee range of the waves.\n  - While reviving, don't do it with creeps around. Take them elsewhere, one person stay back to revive.\n  - Buyback is costlier than normal Dota 2. You buyback ONLY IF your team absolutely can't win the round.\n\n### LANES\n- Bottom right lane is for underlord. You can and should solo till round 5.\n  - If/when you can't hold it, bring them to the outer shrine, through outer shop.\n  - DON'T TAKE THE WAVES TO BASE. That's how you lose.\n- Other 4 heroes should go left side of the map.\n  - Sniper position on the highground of the outer shrine.\n  - Wyvern (top), PA (Mid) and Disruptor (bottom) go on each tower.\n  - Draw aggro and bring the waves to the shrine choke-point from both top, left and bottom side\n- At one point, it'll be hard to hold the creeps there and Shrine will be used\n  - Use Wyvern ult whenever it's too much to handle\n  - It's around the time Underlord brings his creeps there\n  - Use dark rift to get from the outer high-ground to inside of the base (don't walk and die)\n  - Use the inner shrines very carefully, never solo-shrine; ping to ensure people gathering up.\n  - Always be ready to kite them out, if needed to buy time (Wyvern)\n\n### GAMEPLAY TIPS\n- Salves/Clarities don't break (so, don't buy Faerie Fires, Mangoes)\n- You can glimmer while reviving someone, so that you can do it safely\n- ~~Rapier doesn't drop on death, almost always a must-buy on PA and/or Sniper~~ Rapier is disabled in this mod.\n- If the creeps are at base through bottom lane, you're fucking up (not playing correctly)\n- Always keep the buyback gold, but never get into a situation where you'll need to buyback\n\n---\n\nTried writing the whole thing as bullet poins, so that's it easier to scheme-through.  \nPlease ask in comment if some part isn't clear (instead of random \"why phase boots on X hero, noob?\").  \n~~Currently fixing typos and adding missing points. Will be awake for a few more hours to reply back as needed.~~  \n~~Off to sleep, will check in the morning. GLHF~~  \nUpdated builds with core and optional items. Pick optional items depending on team/playstyle.  \nRemoved Hex in favor of Bloodthorn as most people think it's a lot more effective.  \n\nCheers!"

Many of the habits we've acquired will need to change in order to be more efficient on this new map. Some of them are more important than other (hence, *no pull timer or jungling trick in here* - I believe those will generally be covered by others in the community anyway). Being on the same page with the team will help make winning rather easier, compared to the other way around.\n\nThere are also some players (generally decreasing in number as the time goes by) who have opened Dota 2 after 3 months and are baffled by the map, the pull camps, and the fact that their AM has an Aghs and Skadi - they aren't noobs, they don't deserve your flame, they might as well be good players in their days, but out of loop. Just tell them, #itsOK #newMeta #doto700 or something on that line.\n\n**Cool, now let's jump straight to the point.**  \nKeeping it objective (and skipping numbers/maths), will expand sections if asked for.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Lane setup\n\n- **Offlane (short-lane) is now where carries go to farm, with a support**\n  - Carry just last hit - apart from new lane, almost nothing changed for you\n  - Support contest opponents' bounty runes, go davai, give them hell\n  - Don't neutral deny yourself, use the shrine to top up HP/MP and get back\n- **Safe(!) lane is where your typical offlaner will go to get levels**\n  - Try to get as much XP from lane as possible, and keep hitting the nearest jungle camps\n  - You should stack the large camp every odd minute, even if you're not the one clearing it\n  - Keep a tab on when mid/roamer is using shrine and tag along\n- **Mid is a core that activates early, and can survive ganks**\n  - Mid should *rather* farm for a decent while than roaming/ganking\n  - Get a couple of small cost effective items (or Midas ;) ASAP from lane\n  - Use the shrine from your main jungle side (whichever faction you are from)\n- **Pos4/roamer is *THE MOST* crucial role till 15-20min**\n  - You are the guy now who buys bottle, and not your mid (mid is on item rush)\n  - Roam around to pick kills and help out mid and solo UNsafe-laner (bottle 'em up)\n  - You collect the active/powerup runes, you also collect as many bounty runes as possible\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Gold vs XP\n\n- **Death cost is now based on net-worth and not levels**\n  - i.e. carries can't afford to die at all (and always spend unreliable gold)\n  - It also means, poor supports would lose less gold even with higher levels\n  - Too much YOLO/davai will backfire if you're leading too much on net worth\n- **Kill bounty is based on Levels (less than before), and has nothing to do with NW**\n  - so, if one hero in your team *has to* die, it's best for the lower NW hero to die\n  - considering they have similar levels and kill streak but different NW (core vs support)\n  - the enemy will get same kill bounty, however your team will lose less gold (if it was unreliable)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Fighting vs Farming\n\n- **Kill bounty is lesser now, and AOE gold is lesser for more heroes involved**\n  - 5 man smoke gank mostly isn't gonna be worth it.\n  - Solo pick-offs, however, is more rewarding\n- **Heroes can scale much more than before with more items**\n  - **Backpack** for your BoTs, Midas, Cheeses, Refreshers, BKBs etc\n  - Many cores couldn't build Deso+Skadi before, now they can. Psst... it's nasty.\n  - Supports now can carry the support items while having some utility items of their own (yay!)\n- **Talent trees and counter-itemizations**\n  - Using talent trees to counter/force opponents' itemization will play a big role in late game\n  - Also considering enemy talents for own item builds will matter the same way\n  - Which implies, levels and economy are important no matter whichever position you play\n- **If you're getting to farm, don't force a fight**\n  - If you have balanced win condition with similar xp and gold - keep farming\n  - *If you force a fight, and you succeed:* as explained before, team-movements AoE gold for pick offs are less rewarding\n  - *If you force a fight, and you fail:* opponents passively out-farmed you, and dodging fights is easier now with cheaper items\n- **This might get changed/balanced out, but for now dodging fights and farming has more advantage; just avoid getting picked off.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Utilizing new tools\n\n- **Use the shrines effectively and efficiently**\n  - There's no reason for keeping it off CD for too long\n  - Try not to go back to fountain for healing (time ganks correctly)\n- **Use shrines in base while defending raxes**\n  - You're fighting from high-ground WITH an active AOE heal\n  - This is imba, at least for now, but I keep forgetting most of the time :(\n  - This turns fight most of the times (as we're still not used to it, and sieging team over-extends)\n- **Use your backpack effectively**\n  - There's no justification to NOT have a TP anymore\n  - Even as a core you can keep/hold dusts, wards/sentries\n  - Supports can have their windlaces, raindrops, manaboots ALONG WITH wards, dusts smokes\n  - Just think ahead for what you might need in next 5-10 sec (and swap them as the active item)\n- **Kill opponent's Secret Shop Shrine**\n  - Kill it the moment all T2s are down\n  - Ideally kill both shrines before highground push\n  - They allow opponent carry to TP in buy surprise rapier (or abyssal or something... just kill it Okay?)\n  - They allow ez flank for the defending team - people aren't yet good at it, but don't count on that.\n\nGLHF;\n"

There's either a hyper-inflated headroom, or it's super subjective or sensitive to specific board.

So, any direction would be helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Further context, if it's useful in any way**\n\nConsider the following hardware as reference points for the test bed:\n\n* A cheapo 450W ATX PSU (Thermaltake LitePower)\n* A DH67CL motherboard (with 4x4GB Memory modules)\n* A Core i5 2nd Gen CPU (2500k)\n\nIt consumes \\~100W under regular operation all together (measured at mains end) & highest I've seen it peak was about 120W at full blast stress test I've thrown at it.\n\nI'm trying to \"liberate\" the PSU from its current duty, and put in a DIY PSU in its place (made from a 12V30A i.e. 360W SMPS) which has enough overall power headroom, but I can't quite decide how beefy buck converters I should settle for the 5V and 3.3V conversion."

Everytime someone told me they lived in the same place their whole life, I would feel so shocked because... that was supposed to be normal? People don't move everyday 2 years? It makes me sad and a bit jealous to know that these people get to stay in the same place during their whole childhood and maintain their friendships. Everytime I move, I feel like my personality changes, even though I'm not trying to pretend to be anyone. I'm really scared that I'll change again, because I just found my real self, and I have a feeling that I'm already loosing it. I don't know who I am anymore. Everything is a flash, and I'm starting to have a hard time to hold on to my real self. I've always been an extremely sentimental person, even though it hurts me everytime I look back into the past, when I use to be \"happy\". I guess I really want to move back to my old country, but for some reason I know I wouldn't feel at home there either. My ideals are different, my old life wouldn't fit my new mind, and everyone I know have either moved or forgotten me. I've never had many friends during those happy years, because I had myself and my family. But slowly, I was pushed out of my bubble, and when my relationship with my parents worsen, I didn't know who I was anymore. People always say, \"home is where the heart is\", but I don't know where my heart is. Things can't go back to where they were 4 years ago, and I can't be my old self again. I thought I found my place in life, with people that would accept me for who I am. But once again, I feel like I'm falling apart, moving to this new place and having to be different again because of the new atmosphere. I know people always say to \"be yourself\", and I tried that. But as soon as I am completely myself, I scare away the people I trusted the most. And that's ok, I understand. I can be overwhelming, I can be annoying, I can be all of that. I don't even know what I'm trying to say at this point. Everything feels like a mess, I thought moving to this new place and switching schools would be cool, but all that happens is I'm stuck with people that can not understand me at all. We don't share similar stories, and there's no way for them to understand who I really am. Before moving, before everything started to go chaotic, I was able to move without pain because I didn't have those \"problems\". But now that I do, moving to a place where no one can understand forces me to act like I'm fine or else I wouldn't make even one friend. I just don't understand life anymore and I'm tired of how it works."

The only weakness I found was that the deathmasters hidden ability felt more like a liability than a benefit. So I aimed to fix it with the gutter runners.\n\nWith 6 heroes and 4 being Galatians champions means battle tactics shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to pull off, but they are also not protected by anything so you have to be smart with protecting them.\n\nWith the way the list is made, I attempted to optimize the amount of battle traits for each clan without spending too many resources to either one.\n\nThe plague furnace and screaming bell both can\u2019t move without at least 10 models within 6. Deploy them next to the acolytes, stormvermin, or censor bearers to allow them to move to the middle of the board and after that they don\u2019t really need to move anymore.\n\nObviously keep the buffs together; warlock with acolytes, plague priests together, stormvermin with the claw lord, etc.\n\nSpeaking of, claw lord and stormvermin are Galatians command and has stubborn as a rhinox. The point of then is to have them walk around the battlefield and capture objectives. Usually the command trait I would use for him as a heroic action is either the ignoring first two wounds or gaining an additional attack. Or obviously the new Galatian heroic actions if that\u2019s available.\n\nTry this list out and let me know how it goes!

She used to sleep in the bed with me or the chair next to my bed but now only under the bed. Despite this, throughout the day, she still sometimes sleeps on my bed or next to me like she used to. But she has more and more frequently been upset with me whenever I\u2019m on the computer and sits directly in front and stares while swishing her tail back and forth with force. If I make any move towards her like to move or to pet, she starts to bite and often huffs and puffs.\n\nThis has been happening for the last few months and whenever it does I just bring out a toy and she seems to instantly focus on that instead and start playing. The second I stop she goes back to my desk as stares at me. Sometimes she stops afterwards and chills out either on the edge of the bed or under it but even then when I look back at her she\u2019s still unhappy and slams her tail. Is it that she just wants to play and I\u2019m not giving her attention? Then how much attention should I give her since I can\u2019t be playing with her every time she stares at me often for over 10 minutes when I have work to do.\n\nThere didn\u2019t seem to me like anything new changed to cause the change. Even my behavior towards her have been the same. What can I do to get her back to the way she ways?"

I\u2019ve never had anyone show any kinda interest in me and every single girl gave me the cold shoulder, ghosted, some were kind about it, others were not.\n\nI\u2019m only about 21 but for all that time I\u2019ve been a KHV and there was no sign of it stopping, until I met her. I\u2019ve been on tinder for about 5 years and I\u2019ve had a few matches here and there but never any real conversations and DEFINITELY never any dates. But this girl was different. We bonded over Marvel and I asked her on a pasta date (her favorite). She said sure and I was super nervous about my first date ever.\n\nDuring the date we talked and had a really good time. Conversation flowed well and we both seemed very into it. She invited me to an impromptu movie right afterwards and we both enjoyed it. I had never kissed anyone so at the end of the date we only hugged. Since then we had texted a lot and hung out together frequently. For two months we saw each other like 4 times a week. She eventually showed me how to kiss, showed me her body, and we cuddled. She was the most beautiful girl I have ever seen and she was here for me! It was clear that she liked me too. Then my FA started showing.\n\nI got jealous since she was still friends with all her ex boyfriends and was intimate with them, how she\u2019s an extremely attractive girl and she is always getting hit on by other men. But through it all she reassured me and stuck through it. I assured her that it was something I was passionate to change and I did, for the most part. I felt like the luckiest person alive. But in the end, the relationship didn\u2019t work out, and it was because of me.\n\nI wanted a girl who I could have deep conversations with, but everything was surface level for her. Every time I talked about the things I wanted to talk about she got frustrated for not understanding and I got frustrated for her not trying to understand. She made the hard decision first saying that we are probably better as friends. And surprising even to me, I agreed. If fact we were in a limbo period where we knew what needed to be done but both of us didn\u2019t want to take the full leap. Until one day I told her that I needed to get over her because it just hurt too much, and she agreed.\n\nFrom my 2 month relationship I learned that going into a one as an FA will cause A LOT of issues, but if you can find someone to stick with you on it while you fix it, then it will be the best experience you\u2019ve ever had. Sure a relationship may be \u201coverrated\u201d, but don\u2019t let anyone fool you into thinking that it sucks, or that you\u2019re \u201clucky\u201d to be single. The warm feeling I felt was 100% worth all the pain and struggle we both went through, and I would do it all again in a heartbeat. I may not be an FA anymore but I will still give back to the community that raised me lol.\n\nPS. This relationship has given me undue confidence. If a girl like THAT liked me then I can get another one that I really like as well, but just better for me. I think out of everything, my mentality change is what is going to benefit me most. See you on the other side soldiers!"

My following IUD I only wanted in order to have the HRT from the progesterone in order to treat my PCOS.\n\nI had trouble again with my anatomy and the next IUD, so I had it removed.\n\nMost recently, I was prescribed progesterone by my psych doctor to help with my gender dysphoria. My partner picked them up, so I didn\u2019t ask questions when they were filled.\n\nMy vent now\u2026I filled my progesterone prescription only to receive the birth control packets that include a week of placebos.\n\nIn the past, the placebos were a different color pill from the pills that are progesterone. These were all the same color. \n\nI read all of the paperwork that came with the medication. ALL of the fine print. And none of it stated if there were a week of placebo pills.\n\nI called the pharmacy today and they said that yes, they contain placebo pills.\n\nI\u2019m in the US. While I don\u2019t pay for my medication, my meds are still processed through the healthcare system as being for birth control when I\u2019m not using them for birth control.\n\nI\u2019ve had this problem when I was younger\u2026my doctor advised to skip the placebos and just continue taking the pills with the actual medication.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m almost 40 years old and I\u2019m so frustrated with how my meds are prescribed because of billing. I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nIf I take these, I\u2019ll need a refill before it\u2019s due. And I refuse to pay for placebo pills that were not prescribed.\n\nMy partner receives progesterone in a bottle with no placebo pills. It just exhausts me that I don\u2019t know what type of doctor can fill my meds where I receive what I need.\n\nI may be AFAB, but my meds should not be prescribed as birth control.\n\nI grew up in Texas, so medically, my gender was always documented as female, and my complaints have always been disregarded as normal female issues.\n\nI apologize if my wording offends or triggers anyone. I don\u2019t feel female and I don\u2019t feel male. I feel somewhere in between and I\u2019m just looking for others that share similar struggles that just want to be healthy in their body. I just want to be healthy and happy, which includes balancing my hormones in regard to my mood swings without being labeled as male or female."

I talked with my mom about EDS when she was hospitalized awaiting organ transplant because we share many potential symptoms that could be important.

I haven\u2019t felt comfortable asking about all of the specifics because she\u2019s been in the hospital for several months and when I\u2019ve asked specifics she says she just listens to the doctors and she doesn\u2019t know the answers to the details I\u2019m asking.\n\nI\u2019ve also talked about it with my dad and he has said that my half sister has also been diagnosed with EDS. But that could be from my stepmom\u2019s side and that is irrelevant to my health. \n\nI\u2019ve been going over the Wikipedia page on EDS again and I\u2019m surprised that I didn\u2019t notice all of the \u201ccitation needed\u201d entries when I researched it several years ago.\n\nIt says hEDS has no genetic tests. As I continue to read, there are SO many types of EDS and their classification continues to change. Wikipedia says many of these are extremely rare. Are they really? Or are cases underreported or misdiagnosed?\n\nI spoke with my primary care doctor that added it to my file after I described how it affects me and that my mom has it. But I\u2019ve never been tested or referred to a specialist. I\u2019m on Medicaid though, so I can\u2019t easily get tested to narrow down the specific type.\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve been on every SSRI known for depression and I\u2019m currently on medication for possible ADHD and autism. And they help to a degree. But even with those meds, I\u2019m still tired and can sleep most of the day even after having a full nights sleep and then taking my ADHD meds.\n\nI\u2019ve briefly read that EDS can affect your mood and energy because it affects your digestive system.\n\nI have been checked for mitral valve disorders and have none despite everyone on my mom\u2019s side of the family having mitral valve prolapse.\n\nI don\u2019t know what specialist type referral to ask for. I looked at the community side bar and the links didn\u2019t really fit the questions I have. And I apologize for being a broken record, but Wikipedia has always helped me find factual insight. I feel completely lost seeing that so much info on the EDS entry needs citation and that the page is so unorganized that reading about the many different types of EDS has led me to feeling more lost and alone.\n\nAny reply would help at this point. Thank you."

I\u2019m just not ready yet and prefer to ask for someone to reminisce and comment for group therapy purposes. If you go back in my history about 280 something days, I gave fifty dollars to a couple of fellow CAs here. I used to find support in the CA sub before all of the changes (drama) happened. I haven\u2019t had the focus to go back through my history 5 to 7 years when I was most active in the CA sub.\n\nI do remember playing truth or dare on a CA post and it was therapeutic and a wonderful memory. I was dared to draw a picture of a palm tree. I shared and then was proud enough from the support and replies that I hung it on my fridge. This sub doesn\u2019t allow pictures, but if anyone remembers, I\u2019d love to share the picture again.\n\nI also shared a picture of a quote from WC Fields that was on the menu of my local bar that I frequented when I lived in Beaverton, OR. (It was my home watering hole for 10 years.) I received many upvotes for that post. If anyone scrolls long enough through my posts, it\u2019s still there. The quote was \u201cOnce, during Prohibition, I was forced to live for days on nothing but food and water.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve gone through too much change and chaos personally through the past four years that when I tried to revisit the CA sub, it was set to private. I asked around and only received gossip and hearsay. Most recently, I\u2019ve been told that the CA sub is not the community of people that it was before. Thus I prefer to \nask for a random act of CA support here.\n\nIs anyone here an OG CA redditor? Has anyone found a replacement sub or is anyone active in the \u201cnew and improved\u201d CA sub? Or can anyone just reminisce with me? I don\u2019t remember anyone\u2019s usernames that I talked with. I just miss that stability and safety I felt being able to socialize with others who I connected with. I\u2019ve gone through therapies, so many psych medications over 20 years; and alcohol, despite it\u2019s toxicity, always seems to help me not only relax, but focus, function, and be productive and optimistic.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, thank you for your random act of CA. \u2764\ufe0f"

Whilst reading and listening, I really noticed my lack of understanding of certain vocabulary, sayings, idioms, and such that are used in discussion, debate, and literature. So, as a result I created a document in google drive that I use to list all the words I don\u2019t understand with the different explanations and context next to them. This has been helpful but a slow process, as it is just selecting words and idioms I don\u2019t understand here and there. I was wondering if any of you perhaps had suggestions as to how to more efficiently learn philosophical, and political terminology and vocabulary. \n\nYour help is well appreciated\n\nRegards,\n\nMax V"

Some things are just easier to focus on than others, and reading and writing demand different things from you. Writing is more active and therefore more engaging; you can skim-read but there's no such thing as skim-writing. And the more engaged you are in something, the easier it is to focus on it. Not to mention you\u2019re (usually) invested in the story and characters you\u2019re writing about, which makes it much easier to focus on.  \nObviously, I agree that reading is essential, so a short attention span is something that must be pushed through in order to become a good writer. But having trouble focusing on reading doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be able to focus on writing.",

Obviously, this won't work quite as well when you're driving, but if you ever listen to audiobooks at home or make a mental note of what has caught your attention so you can revisit it later in writing, that could be a starting point. That way you'll already be engaged in the story and won't have to focus your attention on reading for as long.\n\nI also found that audiobooks can also help you better understand storytelling and other big-picture elements of writing. It offers you a different perspective on the work, shifting the focus away from the technical elements. This personally helped me, as I tend to struggle with stuff like plotting and pacing while fretting over the minutiae of the prose.\n\nThat said, when it comes to improving your craft, nothing beats traditional reading, especially since you haven't been doing it for a long time. My advice (and I'm saying this as someone with ADHD who used to struggle with reading), is to just push through. Reading is something you have to exercise, and something that gets easier with time. Maybe you could start with an audiobook and make the switch to actual reading once you feel engaged enough with the story and characters. It's not uncommon to struggle with reading at home, so going out with the purpose of reading can also be really helpful if you have the time.",

                "body": ">*Love bombing is a manipulation technique often used by narcissists to overwhelm their victim with romantic gestures designed to make you feel more than simply flattered.*\n\nMy (24f) best friend (24f) started seeing this guy (25) in November, and they went official in December. For context, I met this friend years ago but she moved and we've been long distance for around 6 years now.\n\nShe didn't seem that into the guy at first, just into the attention, and never bothered offering more than half-assed excuses when I pointed out any of his many red flags (like the fact that he might have fathered a child and didn't bother taking a DNA test to make sure). \n\nShe's a very meek and extremely insecure person who hadn't kissed anyone in 6 years so she's especially susceptible to this sort of thing. Her close friends are all long distance ao she doesn't have anyone to reach out to. She also has a history of abuse, with severe trauma from witnessing her mother's psychological and (I think) physical abuse.\n\nHe's been pressuring her every step of the way (including once about sex while knowing she was a virgin), very publically treating her like his gf after one date so everyone in their church (which I find shady af but to be fair I'm distrustful of organized religion) assumed they were official and started prying into their relationship. He never once asked if she was fine with this. This put a lot on pressure on her, especially since she didn't know how she felt about him at the time, something she told me exactly a week before they went official, along with saying she didn't know if she wanted to be his gf and expressing that things were moving very quickly.\n\nThey went official without him consulting her at all, just changing his facebook status to say they were in a serious relationship. I don't know how this works in the rest of the world, but where I'm from \"going steady\" requires previous discussion and just assuming they were in a serious relationship is seriously disrespectful of people's boundaries.\n\nRight after they went official he put her ig handle on his bio and told her he loved her like a week later in an over-the-top text about how they were going to let go of the past and build a future together. Like two weeks into their relationship she invited him to sleep over (she lives with her mother) on Friday and he basically decided to stay for the entire weekend and took to doing that basically every week without asking. He's always talking about how he considers her mother like family, posts pictures of the two of them in his stories constantly, even posting something with a song about loving someone til death.\n\nI think the flattery has finally gotten to her and this makes me concerned. I don't want to ruin her happiness and I've already expressed my concerns about this guy but it was different when she didn't seem to actually care for him. Now she's starting to get a little defensive when I bring this kind of thing up. I came across the concept of love bombing just two days ago and was honestly terrified because I thought it fit this situation so well.\n\nI'm really worried for her. She was doing really well and I'm scared he'll set her back. She's already distancing herself (something I know happens a lot around these parts when people start dating super religious evangelicals), replying less and less. I really haven't been dunking on the guy since they went official so I don't think that's why. I keep wondering if he doesn't want her talking to me or demands all her attention, IDK.\n\nI really don't want to get in the way of her happiness but I've had a bad feeling about this from the get-go, and if I'm right about this being love bombing then her actually getting into the whole thing is super concerning. What do I do? And does this behavior sound weird or am I overreacting?\n\nEDIT 1: Forgot to add that she doesn't have anyone on her corner IRL. She has has her mom who apparently loves the guy (my theory is that it's because her daughter is bi with a preference for women and she's glad she's not dating a girl), to point where her phone's lock screen is a selfie of the happy couple. Add that to the entire church being overly supportive of them and that makes for a lot of pressure to stay together.\n\nEDIT 2: added the absolutely crucial detail that we're long distance, and the fact that she doesn't really have a support network IRL.)"

She used to be super lonely and never go out, even with friends, and I always hoped she would put herself out there so I *should* be happy for her, but I can't because I'm so sure she's going to lose interest in the book. I feel like a terrible person because every time she brings the guy up I just get so irrationally jealous. I can tell she's already beginning to lose interest and now I'm afraid the only reason why she was interested at all was that she was bored and had nothing better to do.

Even if she doesn't want to quit altogether, I know she's just not going to care as much anymore and that alone is enough for me to never want to talk about it again.\n\nI just feel so stupid to have talked about it so much, and like a complete asshole for not being happy for her for such a stupid reason. I'm so tired of getting so invested in things and then feeling other people lose interest and leave me behind, and I'm so tired of caring about things so much in general. I feel like a child for being so distraught over this but every time I even think about it I get this cold feeling in my stomach because I have no clue what I'm going to fill my free time with, and that my friend and I will have nothing more to talk about. And even if I'm totally wrong and she's still as invested (though I've always felt she was less invested than me, which is very likely considering I hyperfixate on shit and she doesn't), I'm so embarrassed by how intensely I'm reacting to something so minor.\n\nI'm also kind of at the start of a relationship and that annoys me too, because I was hoping dating someone would make me hyperfixate less but I'm just as obsessed and maybe writing even more than before.\n\nIf you read this whole thing, thank you. I just really needed to get it off my chest and see if anyone related to this feeling because I feel so alone and stupid right now."

                "body": "Hey guys! I'm currently writing a book where one of the characters is studying to become a neurosurgeon. This doesn't play a huge role in the story, but there are a couple of scenes in which he cares for another character, an underground fighter, after he's been badly beaten. These scenes will take place either at the med student's home or at a warehouse (where they would probably have a first aid kit). Either way, hospitals are out of the question, so he won't have a lot of tools at his disposal.\n\nThe idea is that on one of these occasions the fighter character would have a concussion and on another he would need stitches. The concussion would, ideally, be bad enough for the character to unwittingly divulge private information, but not bad enough to land him in the hospital. The fighter character is 32, has been fighting for around 7 years, and has sustained a head injury in the past that left him in a coma, if that's relevant.\n\nSo, putting it broadly, my main questions are: how would a doctor go about checking up on someone after a bad fight without medical equipment? What would the first step be? What are signs of injury someone educated in medicine would keep an eye out for, but a rando wouldn't think to look for?\n\nMore specific Qs: What is the most surefire way to rule out a concussion? How do you go about stitching a cut on someone's eyebrow at home? What's the most reliable way to check for broken ribs without imaging tests? (this one was surprisingly hard to find an answer to)\n\nI know the answers to these must depend on multiple factors, but a lot of specifics are still up in the air thanks to me being medically illiterate. I'm more than glad to clarify anything and any help at all would be greatly appreciated. If you read all the way here, thank you <3\n\nPS: I'm only using this as a starting point to understand how these scenes would play out because I really have no idea how this kind of thing goes lol but I plan on properly consulting a professional for more thorough help later on."

                "body": "Okay, so last week I (23F) discovered my therapist is a homophobe. I've been having weekly sessions with her for about 2 months or so. Red flag number one was when I told her I'm bi and have been in two relationships with women, and her first reaction was to ask why I'd never dated a man. I told her the opportunity just hasn't really come up.  She promptly ignored this and proceeded to come up with Freudian theories to explain why I haven\u2019t dated a man. I looked past this, thinking I might\u2019ve misinterpreted her somehow.\n\nAnyway, last week she doubled down hard on this. It started with her ignoring the point I was trying to make about something unrelated to my sexuality, and instead focusing solely on my mention of having dated a woman, explaining to me (with a diagram!) that I had a dysfunctional relationship with my parents that caused my attraction to women. When I said I was fine with my bisexuality she said that's great and that it's not something I need to change.\n\nHowever, from there she:\n\n* said non-heterosexual orientations are the result of some sort of family dysfunction (though she did add that \u201caround 1% of homosexuals were born that way\u201d);\n* said her straight clients were consistently happier than her gay ones who supposedly \u201cwere missing something in their lives\u201d;\n* said that no, societal pressure and expectations have no influence on gay people\u2019s sense of fulfillment (when I pointed out that growing up queer in a homophobic society probably had something to do with her gay clients being less fulfilled);\n* said I was wrong in calling society intolerant, pointing out a single gay celebrity who was well-respected here in Brazil (Clodovil to my fellow Brazilians) as proof that there\u2019s no such thing as homophobia;\n* outright stated that the aforementioned gay celebrity was well-respected because he, \u201cunlike so many, wasn\u2019t aggressive about \\[being gay\\]\u201d, phrasing it in a way that made it sound like some people\u2019s queerness could be equated to an act of aggression;\n* said that she would not like to see two men making out in public but \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to see a straight couple doing it either.\u201d\n\nThroughout it all she really went out of her way to pretend not be homophobic, speaking with put-on *extreme* fondness about the gay patients she mentioned, going on and on about how \"incredibly smart\" and \"handsome\" one of them was, and how his husband was \"a lovely man.\" She didn't once use the word \"gay\", only \"homosexual\" (something I've always seen as a red flag in and on itself). She also didn't use the word \"homophobia\", but \"intolerance\".\n\nNeedless to say, **I'm going to stop seeing her.** Still, I'll have my usual session tomorrow and would like to properly explain just how wrong she is. While I think I stated my case well enough last week, I want to make sure I'm fully equipped to face her tomorrow, countering all her arguments with facts and data. I'm already compiling some statistics on homophobia to prove her wrong on that front. I know that the chances of her actually changing her mind on this in a single day are slim, but I feel like I have to at least try.\n\nI'd like as much help as I can get in how to get my point across and possible counter-arguments. I'd especially like some recommendations on literature about the causes of homosexuality to help disprove her claim that it's the result of family dysfunction.\n\nI'll take any advice and words of support really. This is as much a request for advice as it is a vent post. Coming across this kind of backward thinking in this day and age \u2014 especially coming from someone I thought I could trust \u2014 really shook me and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it."

This is not a pretty post, so if you\u2019re not in the mood to be triggered I wouldn\u2019t read this. \n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nI keep having nightmares about my dad. Growing up, it  was so confusing trying to understand the relationship dynamics between my parents. It wasn\u2019t until I was an adult when I realized what was going on was domestic violence. \n\nMy father was being terribly abused and though I was a child, I knew that he was in a dangerous situation. My mother first financially trapped him by making him pay for all the bills, maxing out credit cards under his name, and making him buy a new house every 5 years. My father has a lot of trauma and is very codependent. He is the type to do anything for his family. At the same time, he is also an enabler. But I do realize that before he became an enabler, he was a victim and this is important for my healing. \n\nLast night I had a dream that I was talking to my father and he had gained a lot of weight and was bed ridden. I was begging him to get up and move. He said that he couldn\u2019t because if he did, she would kill him. I spent all day with my dad in a dark room where all he did was lay on his back and watch tv until she came up to call him for dinner. This was actually exactly how it was growing up. My mother controlled my fathers movement. She controlled when he can get up, where he could sit in the house, when he could eat, when he could poop. It was very alarming. And my father never fought back because she had explosive anger and was very manipulative. She would usually take their disagreements out by spanking us or calling her very large family. She also accused my father of being sexually attracted to me and threatened to call the cops on him which forced us into having to have a secret relationship with each other. When she was home, he had to act like he hated me in order to protect the both of us. It was very heartbreaking. \n\nMy mother has a very larger family while my father\u2019s mother died after giving birth and his father abandoned him shortly after. My father was a homeless child due to his father\u2019s abandonment and I think he has a lot of abandonment anxiety. Possible BPD. The perfect victim for my Narc mother. I hated her growing up. I was pretty sure she was going to kill me and I would never make it out of that house alive. But I did. Because I outsmarted her. It was painful because it took a lot of kissing up, gray rocking, and abandoning my true self. But I managed to do it. I outsmarted the witch and got out of that prison. But I have mean survivors guilt for leaving my brother and father behind. \n\nI had to go into protection and stayed in a domestic violence shelter because after opening up to authorities about what was going on in my home, they considered me to be a victim of family related domestic violence. Isn\u2019t that crazy? I get emotional just thinking about it. For years people told me I was exaggerating and I felt scapegoated by the whole world. So it was painful but also liberating to have a domestic violence advocate see me and understand my story. It was such a healing moment. \n\nI wish there was more on men who go through domestic violence because it was the most disheartening thing I ever witnessed. I had to sneak to talk to my father. We could only talk once a week on his days off when my mother wasn\u2019t home. And he would share so much with me. I remember the most traumatizing convo we had. He told me that he had a feeling that she planned on killing him and taking his money. I also felt that these were her intentions. It was an emotional moment. But I couldn\u2019t even cry because I wanted to be strong for my dad. Just thinking about him dying, the only person who was ever kind to me, it broke my heart into irreversible pieces. He asked me to go over his will with him. And he asked me if anything happened, to make sure I look over his will. He gave me entitlements to his will because that\u2019s how dangerous my mother was. He would tell me stories of how she would hold his nose while he was sleeping to stop him from breathing. My father gained an enormous amount of weight from her constantly force feeding him copious amounts of food and forcing him into a sedentary lifestyle. Meanwhile, she would only eat healthy foods and very small amounts. \n\nIt was a disgusting and confusing relationship. I had no one I could relate to better yet talk to. And I remember being in constant fear that she would either kill him or me. When I left home, things got worse for my dad. And I feel awful about that. He\u2019s changed into a massive enabler/yes man. And my mom doesn\u2019t even have to try that hard anymore. She\u2019s in complete control. She used to control his phone back in the day and he had to put it on charge as soon as he got home. He wasn\u2019t allowed to touch it or use it without my mother going through it first. And she would go through his work phone just for fun.\n\nI honestly feel full of rage talking about this. The cocky look on her face. The way she would rub her feet together and hum as if she were in complete bliss while we were all living in hell. I constantly fantasized about smacking the shit out of her and telling the whole world about who she really is. But I was also just a silenced coward that would constantly day dream in order to escape. \n\nI repressed a lot of these memories after moving out. But my dreams are reminding me once again. And my heart is a little heavy today. I wish I could\u2019ve taken my brother and father with me. But her web is wrapped around them too tightly. She controls my fathers phone and email, so there\u2019s no way I can talk to him without her knowing. She even sends me emails from his phone pretending to be him to see if she can bait me into coming back home. \n\nIt\u2019s really hard. I still don\u2019t know how to process any of this. But I\u2019m also thankful to be alive. I\u2019m thankful that someone helped me get out. I don\u2019t know why I was chosen to be the lone survivor here. Maybe because I was the scapegoat. But I just hate that these Narcs have so much power :/"

I feel the need to mention this because some people assume I\u2019m a dude. Anyway, her words kind of resonated with me at the time.

I figured if I wasnt verbablly or physically abusing someone, then they should have no complaints. But I didn\u2019t understand that my detachment was also a weapon. \n\nMy mentor is working with me towards a secure attachment. And I cried a lot today for the first time in years while working the moral inventory. Mainly because I didn\u2019t realize how much hurt I never processed. I just swallowed a shit ton of trauma and kept myself busy in order to avoid feeling the pain. I still have a lot more to go and a lot more to do.

One of the supervisors got a boner while training me and tried to talk dirty to me (in front of other staff) during my first few weeks of being hired. I ended up getting bullied and treated like shit by other staff because of it. \n\nI realized right away what was happening and that I would need to be very guarded and cautious moving forward. I\u2019ve been looking elsewhere but there\u2019s also a pandemic taking place. \n\nMost recently, I experienced a family emergency and had to call out of work. My supervisor was super cold towards me and this is my first time calling out since I\u2019ve been hired. On top of that, she has always been good at calling me by my preferred name until today. Out of nowhere, she started sending my emails with tasks I needed to complete upon returning and addressed me by my government name, which she has never done before. \n\nThe tasks were minor and take a total of 5 minutes to complete and she made it seem like this was an urgent matter. I feel something strange is occurring and I had my first nightmare about the job last night. They have fired a good 6 employees since I\u2019ve been hired and they just got a Union. Apparently they were partaking in shady stuff to the point where people who didn\u2019t even work for the company got involved in protesting against the company and forcing them to bring a union on board. \n\nI do my job diligently no matter how demanding it is. My manager is disorganized, puts some of her work load on me, and can be a tyrant and I have not once complained. But I feel things are getting out of hand quickly and I\u2019m drowning here. I have seen them let go of countless people for no good reason. Why do I have the strangest suspicion that I\u2019m next? \n\nAny tips on how to manage this situation until I can find something else? Due to the demands of the job, it\u2019s really hard to apply to more than a few a day because with I can barely finish my workload within an 8 hour shift."

                "body": "Hey guys! \n\nI had a really weird dream last night. I dreamt that I called out of work (which I actually did before going to sleep) and my boss took forever to respond. She only responded with an excuse as to why she took so long to respond but never really gave me permission to call out. \n\nWhile I was lounging around waiting for a response (because I actually came into work since she didn\u2019t respond yet) I started hanging out with this random guy and he took me to a private place to hook up. No one was in the office yet so we had privacy. Slowly but surely, the office setting began to look and feel like a home. There was a bed room where I went to hook up with the guy. I even fell asleep and heard him going through a closet. \n\nWhen I woke up, I saw this older woman that I never saw before who allegedly worked for the company, directly under my boss. She came around us acting like she was looking for something. When we asked if she needed help, she acted cold and angry. It seemed like she was spying on us. We offered her a seat in the bedroom and she sat there staring with squinty eyes. It was weird. \n\nOut of nowhere, my ex boyfriend appeared cooking in the kitchen. He was making pasta and I noticed that he handed a job application to the lady sitting in our bedroom. It was very weird. After a while, I got up to see what he was doing there. But then the house grew even bigger. I saw what looked like a cult of men circulating the house and chanting really load jargon. They had their faces painted and were wearing tribal clothing. They also appeared aggressive. Everyone in the house was scared, I commanded everyone to lock all doors and windows immediately.\n\nOut of nowhere, a little girl said her friend was outside and she had to get her in first. I went with them to grab the friend. While grabbing the friend, we saw the men approaching us closer. We also saw a giant boa constructor surrounded by frogs and lizards. The boa constructor was an unusual hot pick with cream, muddy gray, and a faint gray/green undertone. It was actually very pretty and bright and stood out. The frogs and lizards were both purple and bright green. The snack coiled itself up into a mountain to prepare to enter the house. By the time the snake and lizards lunged at the house, I was able to get the girls in and close the door just in time. They ended up hitting the glass and immediate ran away. \n\nWe went outside to celebrate and there was an actual party going on. People drinking and socializing. I walked around once more to make sure the coast was clear. And while doing rounds, I bumped into my father (who I\u2019m emancipated from). I saw him dressed as I last remember him dressing. And he looked at me with these really sad and intense eyes. There was also a bit of anger in the mix. I looked his way for a second but shortly after ignored him. It was hard because I always felt guilty when ignoring my father. But he shortly after disappeared.\n\nThis is a lot to process. Any clue what any of this means?"

Memorise random events of the past before I go there. Then, right before they happen, tell Gutenberg that it's going to happen. He'll be shocked. Tell him it's me causing it. I'm god after all.\n\nStep 2. Gutenberg writes about me. I'm famous now. Find an ENTJ. She can keep things running. Other people in power are going to be outraged. It's only natural. Use Gutenberg's invention to my advantage. Write outrageous shit about the kings in my papers. Take away their support. Now everyone will bow to me.\n\nStep 3. Find a decent castle. Pop an INTJ atop the topmost spire, and voila, I just invented weather forecasting. \n\nStep 4. Start the scientific revolution early. Teach scientific principles to my disciples, and build a global superpower in the 1400s. Teach them basic hygiene, and germ theory and modern medicine and warfare and strategy. Have an ENTP assist me in this.\n\nStep 5. Get an ISFP to make me look perfectly attractive all the time. Gotta make sure that ENTJ is obsessed with me, not the power I provide.\n\nStep 6. Get two bodyguards. An ISTJ and an ISTP. The ISTP hides behind in the shadows and keeps an eye out from a distance.\n\nStep 7. Get an ENFP and ESTP to keep me company and make me laugh at all times. (Yes, they're dating)\n\nStep 8. Chill??"

There is a normal range of deviation. People and brains are diverse. However neurodivergencies like ADHD and Autism are very clearly outside of the normal range. They\u2019re not just diverse, it\u2019s diver*gent* from the typical range of diversity. \n\nThe line really isn\u2019t that grey. \n\nFirst, in science the line isn\u2019t very grey between neurotypical and neurodivergent. It\u2019s not some arbitrary thing they made up. There\u2019s been extensive research done on \u201cnormal\u201d people and \u201cabnormal\u201d people and the distinction between them is usually pretty clear, because it\u2019s not just one weird thing about them it\u2019s many. That\u2019s what makes it diagnosable, 3 abnormalities can be within the normal range but 20 is not. Especially with things like ADHD (neurodivergent but common and well studied) research often shows clear distinctions between what works for neurotypicals and what works for ADHDers, making the line fairly distinct. \n\nNext to neurodivergent people the line usually doesn\u2019t appear very grey. Maybe at first, it\u2019s very common for a lot of us who were diagnosed late to think if we do have something it\u2019s just \u201cmild\u201d. But on deeper investigation and reflection, very often we realize that all these minor \u201cquirks\u201d of ours and personality traits we rarely if ever see in other people, all stem from our ADHD, Autism, etc. Many \u201chigh functioning\u201d autistics and ADHDers - usually people smart enough, conventionally attractive enough, anxious enough, and/or observant enough to \u201cpass\u201d as a mildly strange neurotypical - most of us can tell that something is just different about us than the general population, often since early childhood. Like walking in to a game everyone apparently already knows the rules and strategies for, assumes you know it too, so you just try your best and awkwardly play the game. Yes you\u2019re right, there is no one presentation and experience of having the same neurodivergency. But once we know and have the words to express the things we\u2019ve experienced, we\u2019re all different but much more similar to each other than we are to the general public. The line isn\u2019t that grey to us either. \n\nLastly, even the general public can tell that we\u2019re abnormal. They notice weird things about how we speak, how we act, what we wear, what we eat, what we do for fun, how we handle responsibilities, how we take care of ourselves, how sensitive we are, yet also how blunt we are\u2026 the list goes on. Even if they don\u2019t think, as an outsider, that we\u2019re weird enough to be autistic or have ADHD or whatever it is - it\u2019s still weird enough that they notice and sometimes bothered by it. Normal people don\u2019t get told they\u2019re doing a bunch of normal everyday things badly or abnormally. \n\nSo if science can tell we\u2019re abnormal, Neurotypicals can tell we\u2019re abnormal, and *we* can tell we\u2019re abnormal\u2026 doesn\u2019t that mean the line is clear enough? What\u2019s the purpose in skating around labels and trying to act like it\u2019s all really normal, when it\u2019s not?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that there aren\u2019t trade offs, things I\u2019m naturally better at because I struggle with \u201cnormal\u201d things. And I\u2019m not saying that there aren\u2019t evolutionary advantages to neurodivergency. \n\nBut the point isn\u2019t that we\u2019re all weird so we\u2019re all really the same. We\u2019re all unique, but there\u2019s clearly a subset of people that are more than just diverse but diver*gent*. And that\u2019s a good thing. Being \u201cnormal\u201d is good, and being different or weird or *divergent* is good too. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much benefit in framing it the way you did in the field of science or for neurodivergent people themselves. I can only see neurotypical people benefiting, because people being different is scary so we like to pretend they\u2019re not actually that different. And neurodivergent people that haven\u2019t fully accepted and fully appreciate who they are for the same reason. \n\nI\u2019m not a therapist or researcher though, so feel free to take that with a grain (or bucket) of salt to be safe. Just my long 2 cents lol.",

                "body": "The other day I was talking to someone I\u2019m assuming is an atheist and explaining why Christianity as a whole shouldn\u2019t be \u201ccanceled\u201d because some Christians use it for bad. And why he shouldn\u2019t assume all Christians are like this until they prove to him they aren\u2019t. He believed until I get the rest of my faith under control it should be \u201ccanceled\u201d. \n\nIt was a long conversation but it eventually got down to this - \u201cyou seem to have this idea that respect should be freely given not earned and that\u2019s bs\u201d. Well yes, I do, I genuinely believe the Bible when it says for me to love and treat my neighbor like I would myself. \n\nOn paper most people can agree to that idea - loving your neighbor as yourself is a good thing. However when it gets down to people they see as bad  - atheists, Christians, conservatives, liberals, etc. it\u2019s a different story. Atheists get upset when Christians label atheism as this hate-filled group because some atheists are anti-theists and go out of their way to belittle and berate our faith. Christians get upset when Atheists label Christianity as this hate-filled group because some Christians are hateful and go out of their way to belittle and berate other's personal beliefs. \n\nGuys, they\u2019re the same thing. It\u2019s the same exact mindset. It\u2019s the flesh part of ourselves that doesn\u2019t *truly* believe in treating everyone like we\u2019d want to be treated. It\u2019s unnatural to us. \n\nIt\u2019s actually hilarious, I\u2019m black and a Christian on r/Christianity a month ago was saying the same thing to me. That I needed to fix the bad black people if I and my race wanted to be worthy of respect. \u201cThat I needed to fix the bad Christians if I and my religion wanted to be worthy of respect.\u201d I literally cannot control other black people in the same way *you* know you cannot control other Christians.\n\n**They\u2019re the same thing**.\n\nI\u2019m not saying they have the same power and results because though some may disagree it\u2019s obvious to me that being black has affected my life much worse than it has being Christian in America and that\u2019s true throughout history as well. \n\nBut hating a poor person because they\u2019re poor is wrong. Hating a rich person because they\u2019re rich is wrong. The poor person is disadvantaged and this hate will likely make it worse for them but it\u2019s still wrong to hate rich people for being rich. The mindset itself is wrong. \n\nEveryone gets not liking something to some degree. Most sins people commit the majority of the population people agree are bad things to do. But the majority of the population does not agree with just handing out respect, truly loving and treating your neighbor as yourself. \n\nSo do you agree Christianity should be \u201ccanceled\u201d because some Christians are bad? Do you believe it should be assumed that you hate gay people because you\u2019re Christian? I\u2019m going to guess no.. so believe that about other groups too. Race, religion (or lack of), political stance, ethnicity, nationality, class... Don\u2019t make a group's sole purpose out as evil because 95% of the time that\u2019s not true. Don't act as if a person is guilty of their stereotype until proven innocent. You don\u2019t like when others do it to Christians so don\u2019t do it to other groups. Treat others the way you want to be treated. Even if they hate you. \n\nI see the failure to use this mindset amongst Christians nearly as much as I do nonbelievers. Even against other Christians. But because this is literally the second most important aspect of our faith (after loving God) I expect better of the church. I am not saying I\u2019m faultless in this aspect and am definitely more flawed in other areas but I believe I can see this more clearly than most so that *someone* can let the church know we need to get better in this area. So please try, do what is unnatural to us and truly love your neighbor as yourself and treat them the same you\u2019d want to be treated. This is God working through us yes, but like we must work hard to resist other sins the same goes for this one as well. \n\n> \u201c\u201cBut to you who are willing to listen, I say, love your enemies! Do good to those who hate you. Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who hurt you. If someone slaps you on one cheek, offer the other cheek also. If someone demands your coat, offer your shirt also. Give to anyone who asks; and when things are taken away from you, don\u2019t try to get them back. Do to others as you would like them to do to you.\n\n>\u201cIf you love only those who love you, why should you get credit for that? Even sinners love those who love them! And if you do good only to those who do good to you, why should you get credit? Even sinners do that much! And if you lend money only to those who can repay you, why should you get credit? Even sinners will lend to other sinners for a full return. \u201cLove your enemies! Do good to them. Lend to them without expecting to be repaid. Then your reward from heaven will be very great, and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High, for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked. You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate.\u201d\n\u202d\u202dLuke\u202c \u202d6:27-36\u202c \u202d\u202c\u202c"

At first glance it does seem like a correct interpretation, especially since elsewhere it's said you can beat a slave with a rod. \n\nHowever I saw something saying that they also used a rod to guide sheep who were straying from the right path. It wasn't used to beat them it was more correction. And that if you look at verses like Proverbs 13:24, 22:15, and 23:13 it says \"the rod\" not \"a rod\" implying it's metaphorical. \n\nI'm wondering how Jews and Christians have interpreted these verses over the years. And specifically if we know if those in OT times (where a rod was still in common use) would have seen it referring more to the beating a slave rod or guiding a sheep rod or both.\n\n*Edit*: I understand it's a big debate but I'm specifically interested in seeing how Jews and Christians *in the past* have interpreted it, not our own personal arguments for either interpretation. Not asking in order to form my own opinions on good parenting (that can be done without knowing the history), just curious as to how it has historically been viewed. Because I always assumed they took it literally and it was the beating interpretation, until presented with the sheep interpretation. Either way, the message is \"discipline is good\" just the methods of discipline vary."

For example, in Skyrim, even after you finish the main questline, you can keep wandering around Tamriel forever even if you run out of quests. But in other games, the credits roll after completing the main questline and you're done with the entire story for good. How does Cyberpunk work in this regard? I was curious because I can't decide if I should put off the main storyline till I finish all the the side tasks. No major spoilers past Act I please :)\n\n(PS-- yes, I already know that there are six possible endings. Still curious though.)"

Either by yourself, if you failed or just simply left scars or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you.\n3. It does get better. Believe it or not, it will eventually get better. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow.\n4. There's so much you would miss out on doing.\n5. There is always a reason to live. It might not be clear right now, but it is always there.\n6. So many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself.\n7. You ARE worth it. Don't let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise.\n8. You are amazing.\n9. A time will come, once you've battled the toughest times of your life and are in ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. You will emerge stronger from this all, and won't regret your choice to carry on with life. Because things always get better.\n10. What about all the things you've always wanted to do? What about the things you've planned, but never got around to doing? You can't do them when you're dead.\n11. I love you. Even if only one person loves you, that's still a reason to stay alive.\n12. You won't be able to listen to music if you die.\n13. Killing yourself is never worth it. You'll hurt both yourself and all the people you care about.\n14. There are so many people that would miss you, including me.\n15. You're preventing a future generation, YOUR KIDS, from even being born.\n16. How do you think your family would feel? Would it improve their lives if you died?\n17. You're gorgeous, amazing, and to someone you are perfect.\n18. Think about your favorite music artist, you'll never hear their voice again...\n19. You'll never have the feeling of walking into a warm building on a cold day\n20. Listening to incredibly loud music\n21. Being alive is just really good.\n22. Not being alive is really bad.\n23. Finding your soulmate.\n24. Red pandas\n25. Going to diners at three in the morning.\n26. Really soft pillows.\n27. Eating pizza in New York City.\n28. Proving people wrong with your success.\n29. Watching the jerks that doubted you fail at life.\n30. Seeing someone trip over a garbage can.\n31. Being able to help other people.\n32. Bonfires.\n33. Sitting on rooftops.\n34. Seeing every single country in the world.\n35. Going on road trips.\n36. You might win the lottery someday.\n37. Listening to music on a record player.\n38. Going to the top of the Eiffel Tower.\n39. Taking really cool pictures.\n40. Literally meeting thousands of new people.\n41. Hearing crazy stories.\n42. Telling crazy stories.\n43. Eating ice cream on a hot day.\n44. More Harry Potter books could come out, you never know.\n45. Traveling to another planet someday.\n46. Having an underwater house.\n47. Randomly running into your hero on the street.\n48. Having your own room at a fancy hotel.\n49. Trampolines.\n50. Think about your favorite movie, you'll never watch it again.\n51. Think about the feeling of laughing out loud in a public place because your best friend has just sent you an inside joke,\n52. Your survival will make the world better, even if it's for just one person or 20 or 100 or more.\n53. People do care.\n54. Treehouses\n55. Hanging out with your soul mate in a treehouse\n56. Snorting when you laugh and not caring who sees\n57. I don't even know you and I love you.\n58. I don't even know you and I care about you.\n59. Nobody is going to be like you ever, so embrace your uniqueness!\n60. You won't be here to experience the first cat world emperor.\n61. WHAT ABOUT FOOD?! YOU'LL MISS CHOCOLATE\n62. Starbucks.\n63. Hugs.\n64. Stargazing.\n65. You have a purpose, and it's up to you to find out what it is.\n66. You've changed somebody's life.\n67. You could change the world.\n68. You will meet the person that's perfect for you.\n69. ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n70. If you end your life, you're stopping yourself from achieving great things.\n71. Making snow angels.\n72. Making snowmen.\n73. Snowball fights.\n74. Life is what you make of it.\n75. Everybody has talent.\n76. Laughing until you cry.\n77. Having the ability to be sad means you have the ability to be happy.\n78. The world would not be the same if you didn't exist.\n79. It's possible to turn frowns, upside down\n80. Be yourself, don't take anyone's shit, and never let them take you alive.\n81. Heroes are ordinary people who make themselves extraordinary. Be your own hero.\n82. Being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect. It means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections.\n83. One day your smile will be real.\n84. Having a really hot, relaxing bath after a stressful day.\n85. Lying on the grass and laughing at the clouds.\n86. Getting completely smashed with your best friends.\n87. Eating crazy food.\n88. Staying up all night watching your favorite films with a loved one.\n89. Sleeping in all day.\n90. Creating something you're proud of.\n91. You can look back on yourself 70 years later and be proud you didn't commit suicide.\n92. Being able to meet your Internet friends.\n93. Tea / Coffee / Hot Chocolate\n94. The new season of Sherlock\n95. Cuddling under the stars.\n96. Being stupid in public because you just can.\n97. If you are reading this then you are alive! Is there any more reason to smile?\n98. Being able to hug that one person you haven't seen in years\n99. People care enough about you and your future to come up with 100 reasons for you not to do this.\n100. But, the final and most important one is, just, being able to experience life. Because even if your life doesn't seem so great right now, anything could happen."

Reigen shows how much he cares about Mob that he let's go of him and stops his more scummy and manipulative tendencies of putting on a facade to try to fool Mob into still being his pupil. He has accepted the fact that Mob no longer needs his guidance and he's ok with it, after all, he cares above all else Mob's feelings.\n\nOn a similar note, by taking his mask off Reigen makes a very important point for both Mob and Shigeo to learn: accepting all of the \"versions\" of yourself as one. Reigen had some resentment for who he was and didn't like his more manipulative tendencies. He even says that when Serizawa asked him if Mob would be ok with rejection that \"he doesn't have to hide his true self, unlike me who would get rejected\" (something like that). Reigen put that facade of confidence and being a super powerful esper because without it, he didn't feel worthy of being Mob's mentor. He never really liked a key part of himself and that's what his lies were trying to protect. By being truthful, not only does he let go of Mob as a pupil, but he also accepts that part of himself which he doesn't really like and presents himself as one, inspiring Mob and Shigeo to do the same",

Envy that a decision as important has having, or not having a baby, could be entirely down to the women. The knowledge that since a woman is pregnant she biologically does not need the father anymore makes it feel like the women has more power and saying to the baby than us, and so, other men try to control the process of abortion much more because they're trying to claim more power to a discussion where they feel impotent. They try to control women's body because the male body doesn't have the same amount of power in the process of having a baby.\n\nIn other words, these men probably think that a women being able to do it on her own right \"wouldn't be fair\". \n\nOf course that it's purely instinct and not rational but that never stopped anyone from having shit justifications to an illogical opinion that they feel should be right.\n\nThis is also just a suggestion and I might completely wrong of course, so if anybody can spot something wrong that would be very helpful.\n\nEdit: I know this isn't the only reason why men do it but it's a theory as to what could motivate them to be anti-abortion, more so than women. I have a theory that what also motivates people, not just men, to be anti-abortion is because we all have the image of the benevolent milf, I mean, mom archetype on our mind and so it feels very disturbing when we think of a mother \"killing\" her own child, even if we don't believe that a fetus is a person. Again, just a theory.\n\nI am also aware that this doesn't really change or help women in their fight to have their rights, just a thought I had that could further our understanding if it's remotely right."

Let's say you took frost, your right click has three different spells and your frost skill has 3 different spells. Everytime you use metamagic you cycle to the next spell. Sorcerer's have no limit of spells they can cast but relatively long cooldowns. The right click can always be used but the skills will have seperate 10-50 second cooldowns. All spells are shared with wizard, they just have access to them in different ways. This makes development easier while still maintaining class identity. \n\nFrost\n\nRight click: \nfrost bolt\n\nfrost shield (summons a shield of frost that acts as an actual shield in your right hand) \n\ntouch of frost (makes a door or chest breakable by any weapon) \n\nSkill: \nfrost nova (freeze enemies around you for a short duration) \n\nblizzard (channel to deal damage and heavily slow enemies in an aoe around you) \n\nfrost wall (create a wall of frost, breakable by most weapons after a few hits) \n\nFire\n\nRight click:\nZap\n\nLight ball\n\nIgnite\n\nSkill:\nFireball\n\nFire wall (create a line of fire that deals damage to anyone entering and possibly interacts with arrows)\n\nCampfire (start a grey campfire, very long cooldown) \n\nLightning\n\nRight click: \nLightning shield (reflect damage back to melee attackers, applies even if you phase the attack)\n\nLightning bolt (a generic electric attack) \n\nElectrify (trap a door or metal chest, the next person to interact with the object takes a small amount of damage)\n\nSkill:\nLightning blast\n\nChain lightning\n\nPhase (all arrows and weapons move through your character  as if it wasn't there for a short duration) \n\nArcane\n\nRight click: \nmagic missile\n\nHaste\n\nSlow\n\nSkill:\nArcane explosion (knocks enemies back and deals damage)\n\nPrecognition (meditate, then move the camera around as if you where moving for a medium duration, can move through walls and doorways and hear/see enemies)\n\nInvisibility\n\nObviously the skill ideas here are just suggestions the main idea being the metamagic/element selection for skills.

                "body": "So this is going to be long winded but it's basically going to be my feedback for the 80 hours or so I played of the playtest, split into sections for readability. \n\n1. Bugs/non balance or game related issues\n\nAs everyone has probably experienced jumping over spiders can be troublesome as you can get stuck above them, or stutter while trying to move around them. I don't exactly know how you fix this but it's definitely a problem. The stutter effect also happens in other areas, around torches or uneven patches of ground. If I'm running away from a hit and I can't move in the direction I'm trying to move I need to stop more clearly so I know I need to change direction. \n\nThere is also a problem with casting, I tend to use the audio cues to know when my casts are charged and if you release your spell right as it becomes fully charged it occasionally just doesn't cast, even though you hear the fully charged sound cue, and it even plays the animation for casting. \n\n2. Classes\n\nObviously talents aren't out so we have no clue what's going to be good and what isn't. I'm just going to give a review of each class and my personal suggestions for any changes/additions. I'm looking at grey geared as far as balance goes because itemization is an entirely different subject. \n\nBarbarian: here's Johnny! As a class fantasy Barbarian is really filling that role breaking all the chests and axing all the people, with no shirt on of course. He was a little strong and I think it's because of how many tools he has to counter classes that should be countering him. Fighters should be barbarians main counter, but barbarians can almost one shot them with their 75% armor penetration attack. I think barbarians strengths should be focused on and some of his counterplay removed. Perhaps give him a speed boost while running towards enemies, increased if they are injured. A brief massive damage mitigator for a couple seconds to help him engage, but leave him vulnerable to enemies that are hard to kill and tanky. Also if whirlwind can be implemented in any way shape or form that would be sick. \n\nRogue: the class fantasy is perfect, there's so many ways to play rogue and all of them are scummy. Very weak for combat but a rogue properly abusing their cooldowns and movement speed can be a nightmare. I think hide passives need to be changed to need you to be hidden for a certain duration however, I see rogues just turning invisible for half a second all the time during combat just for a damage proc and that's kinda dumb. Also make pickpocket work during stealth, I love the meme potential it brings. \n\nRanger: rewarded heavily for taking positioning advantages or preplanning traps, I think Rangers are pretty cool. Many people dont like playing against them because they are at an advantage camping or controlling a zone. People don't realize tho that Rangers are very weak to flanks, if you know the map well enough you can generally get in on the backside of a ranger and cut off his escape. Rangers can't really push or force fights either so you can generally just walk away, since most areas in the game are very closed off.  I would like to see a poison/fire arrow ability, just to see meme magic ranger builds and so magic damage ranger gear isn't completely a bust. \n\nCleric: clerics spell system is what I want to see for mage, super powerful abilities locked behind a stat wall, and having to make meaningful choices on what spells to bring based on the knowledge you have available. I like the idea of cleric as a caster in the back being support, and I also like drunk war hammer cleric, it's honestly a class I can't think of anything to be added except maybe more holy damaging spells. \n\nFighter: fighter does it all, very slowly. Even with sprint fighter struggles to catch enemies but they are a walking powerhouse. Fighter right now fulfills a tank role, he prevents enemy engages simply by being better than them at everything they do, while being unable to engage himself. At least that's what he's supposed to do, but barbarians are dealing too much damage. \n\nWizard: I played wizard for a majority of the playtest and it's by far my favorite. There's a few spells that are clearly not super good though. Lightning strike is for one, bugged. It should be targeted at the position you target on the ground always, but if somebody is in the way of your cursor it gets targeted at them instead. For two it's range is far too low, I would love to see a longer range lightning strike with maybe even a longer duration to compensate, as is I saw it ran by almost nobody. Chain lightning was neat but there seems to be a very short window between it hitting, and it bouncing back to you. It always seemed like enemies where either too close or too far to use it properly. However that being said it is really powerful and fun to use and any buff to it could be unhealthy. Frost bolt is pretty bad but if the slow duration or effectiveness were increased I could see it being a much better defensive spell. Maybe I wasn't using it right but slow also seemed pretty bad. Perhaps the duration could be increased by around 1 second and it would see more play. I would like to see more high level mage spells, maybe something like blizzard (a channeled area denial spell?) and perhaps lowered spell capacity so you can't use whatever spell you want in grey gear. \n\n3. Items/game balance\n\nSo I want to start by addressing added damage, this stat should not be implemented without a per weapon/skill scaling attached. If you get 30 more damage on a 2 hand axe it's doing like 50% more damage, if you get 30 more damage on magic missiles they are doing 250% more damage, which is insane. It also applies to dots so things like fireball are double dipping (fireball could be triple dipping, the training dummy takes damage from the initial hit and the aoe) this means that 30 added damage on fireball is equal to a total of 90 more damage on a direct hit, quadruple it's original value.\n\nFor pve, this means rogues and mages who have multi hit and fast hitting attacks will scale the hardest with flat damage, and barbarians will have a hard time getting much more than the damage they started with. \n\nFor PvP this means players dying very very fast. The biggest issue with this game I experienced in the final hours I played high roller. Every person I killed died in one hit, and then I died in one hit. Now I don't think damage scaling should be removed, but I do think defensive scaling should be greater than damage scaling. Longer more drawn out fights with more healing, running, and trying to survive, are way more fun than peeking a corner and eating an arrow/fireball and all your loot is gone. Damage should scale too, for pve purposes, but damage mitigation needs to at least match or surpass it IMO. I think the high end gear gameplay would feel much better if mitigation/health pool was put directly into rarity, this would create a disparity where greens could still give you tons of damage, but even badly rolled blues/purples/oranges would give you a higher chance of surviving with those awesome pieces. \n\nTrue damage should be removed completely, it makes balancing mitigation very difficult, if a player has mitigation vs a certain form of damage they should be able to play like it. \n\nI think attribute stats should be able to roll up to double all attributes, all attributes with the way attributes are set up right now will likely be king, but being able to get 6 of a specific stat would also be cool and make a stat other than all attributes or damage valuable. \n\nAs some other people have suggested, an all grey mode only would be good. It gives you an easy baseline for balancing a fun mode. Aside from that it makes collecting gear easier when there isn't hyper geared players running around noobstomping lobbies rather than entering lobbies with other highly geared players. \n\nI have a proposed system for hell/boss runs, and an experience that lends itself better to people making it down to further floors. \n\nFirst floor, there is no circle, the priority here is pve though you can encounter and fight other players. Up to green gear drops here and down portals and escape portals spawn all over.\n\nSecond floor is exactly as it is now, with circle forcing player interactions. Third floor portal only appears to the last team left in the map so you either have to chase out or kill the last remaining players to go to hell. Essentially the reward for winning the battle Royale is going to third floor. Up to blue drops here. \n\nThird floor, is a completely pve experience. The circle always closes on the boss room and escape portals do not open here, the only way to escape is to defeat the boss so if you come to hell you have to come prepared to do so. Hell drops up to purple gear and the boss drops a guaranteed legendary, and a key, then spawns an escape portal. Because it's a pve experience that's gated behind winning the battle Royale on floor 2 it's not infinitely farmable by just being good at bossing. \n\nThis part is optional but I thought was pretty cool, Key opens up a fourth floor mode that is similar to the second floor but has up to purple drops, the last team standing on that floor gets a hell portal to the fifth floor (pve), which can drop legendaries and has an even more insane boss that drops a guaranteed unique. \n\nThat's it! That's everything I wanted to say about the game. Honestly I would pay 80 dollars right now to play this game as is because it's just that good but I'm ok waiting for the devs to fully realize their vision for the game as well. Hope somebody enjoys reading this absolute wall of text! \n\nTldr; barbarian op pls nerf!!!!"

The town progression so far feels like an attempt to make it feel like there's some kind of base building going on without any actual meaningful choices. \n\nI may have expected this level of watering down of game mechanics from many other AAA developers but didn't expect this from a firaxis game. I don't buy games to watch cutscenes and then spend 5 minutes making decisions that don't really matter because of how easy the game is. \n\nNot only that but the game released at full 80 dollar price with a 70 dollar dlc, like it isn't just content they decided to remove from the finished product to sell separately. \n\nNobody was here to warn me so let me warn you, this game sucks, I'm highly disappointed, and my day is ruined."

In the end, he wanted to stop whatever we were doing with each other and told me he thinks it's best for him to have time for himself.

I don't know what people are bullying you about but please know that it's not healthy to bottle it up. I recommend a valid form of revenge, one that won't get you expelled, but still bite them in the ass. That's how I get even with most people, helps let go of the pent up anger.\n\nBut don't worry, things get better, one way or another. At least, it's definitely better out of school. Stay kind, but don't let others walk over you. Be fierce, but never be violent.\n\nBut yeah, you'll get through this.

The silent gaze and walking away from me. The fact that none of us talk to each other. My silence and not knowing what to talk about is annoying.

It might not seem like much but damn that triggered me hard.\n\nI was stuck on my bed again, after a long time. My roommate is on her desk, playing something. I really can't risk being a mess. So basically, I cried on my bed. All them clique thoughts of how I'm not worth anyone's time and how I'm worthless. How much I wanna hurt myself. It eventually made me cry. I was able to keep it silent but it took a while for me to actually dry my face with my blankets and head out to bike outside.\n\nAfter my face was dry, I wore my earbuds and told my roommate as cheerfully as I think is normal that I'm going out to bike. My destination is my usual crying spot, on the back of campus. It was still 11pm, too early for comfort tbh. Halfway, I already started crying again. I was listening to this song ( https://youtu.be/aHUVqV5CO6w ). Hell yeah I'm worthless hahah.\n\nBut this time was kinda different. I started screaming. It felt right. I sat down in my usual dark corner of a road and started crying and screaming in the dark, music at max volume.\n\nBut then two people suddenly showed up. They asked me if I'm ok. I felt kinda bad they had to hear me cry. They seemed like a couple just out on a date tbh. I asked them nicely to leave me be and told them I'll be ok by tomorrow. They did leave me and I just stopped screaming out my cries heheh.\n\nI really feel like it's a sin for me to actually express how I feel. I really feel like I MUST filter out all my emotions through drawing, singing, poetry and even journaling like this. It's a sin for me to show that I have emotions at all.\n\nSo anyways, I'm just lonely. Extremely lonely. And also fearful of people. And coincidences haven't been very helpful to me. I'm too lonely to be alone but too anxious to present myself to other people. I miss hanging out with my friends but I know I can't make any contribution to conversations. I feel pressured by mom to talk to her but I really can't risk feeling worse after talking to her. I hold people's words that hurt me as proof that they don't want me around them. \n\nI really can't say any of this to anyone irl. I feel like I'm never good enough nor acceptable if I ever show any of this to other people. Feels like the more I tell people how sick I am, the more they avoid me in the end. And I don't feel like I have anyone at all at the moment. So technically, I really just don't have anyone to tell this to. But I'm really tired of feeling like I've lost people.\n\nA few days ago I felt like I reached a conclusion. Seems like people know what they wanna do in life. The short term desires, like buying a game, eating out after work, reading something that they've been looking forward to. I don't really have those. I don't really value life that way. Honestly, I think all I ever want is to feel loved. I just wanna feel safe and not have to fight to hide my emotions in front of others. I just wanna be held for me and have all my flaws known by everyone, and feel glad that I have been accepted and have somewhere to call home. I want to stop fighting for approval through all my actions. I want to do nothing and still be loved for being me.\n\nI hate that I can't say this to anyone and I really want to slit my throat.\n\nBut anyways, those two strangers did help. The dude said, \"It's ok. Everything is going to be alright.\" I really needed people to tell me that tbh. It's been a while since I wished to hear that but hey, it's nice to finally hear it.. they did ask me \"what happened?\" It feels bad that the answer is actually \"nothing\". Just,, nothing ever happens anyways. It's always too internal to call that something actually did happen.\n\nI stayed there for a little longer. It's actually nice how even without my glasses I could still somewhat see the stars. I left the place to go to my department building instead. When I biked away, I saw the couple walking back to where I was, I briefly said sorry and biked away.\n\nI bought some milk tea in the department building. Emergency serotonin, I dub it haha. Then I went to the rooftop. My tears are drier than before. I changed the music I was looping as well. It felt kind of better. When I came back to the dorm, I talked to room mate about her day at work. I was feeling kinda better."

I woke up at 6 am, went back to sleep and woke up again at 8, then 9, 10, and finally woke up at 11. Brother asked me if I wanted to eat breakfast with him, I said no at 11. Then I proceeded to start my day with memes. Reels from Instagram. Stopped at 12.\n\nTook a bath and reminded myself I have to take care of a few things today. I saved and printed a few files two people sent to me to be printed and stamped by the department office. So I bathed. Made the choice of buying convenience store food. Bought a little more today since I didn't eat enough last night.\n\nI ate lunch accompaniment by some youtube  videos about reviews of the series' that I liked. I had a hard time finishing my food as I got a bit full to keep eating them. I end up leaving three pieces of chicken nuggets before leaving to handle the documents.\n\nI went to print them. Met Iron after I was finished and we talked about a girl he liked, his new piercing and how to properly call him by a racial slur. Then I went to the department office to get the documents rechecked, stamped and copied. Had a nice little chat with Bee about random things such as how the English language doesn't seem to have a mainstream way of saying \"\u52a0\u6cb9\" which was kinda annoying.\n\nAfter taking the photos of the documents and sending them to the people in question, I went home. I ate my remaining nuggets and watched a video on how humanity learned to boil food.\n\nIt was the end of my tasks for the day. Now all I have to do is wait until dinner time and buy food. \"Maybe I'll cook today\", was what I thought in the morning but honestly I have no energy left to even try to create that new kind of marinade that I've never tried before.\n\nSo I ended up doing what I do best everyday. I napped. Before I slept, I read a one-shot manga about someone recording their mother's death and turning it into a movie. I won't go further into details but it was a really good piece of fiction. Then I went to sleep.\n\nI woke up an hour later. I'm still alone in my room. I don't remember what I was doing exactly. Some slight self loathing? Thinking about some parts of my life? I think I was venting to my LINE private group again, only inhabited by me. Then I suddenly got a message from a friend.\n\nA photo. I felt like shit. I, for some reason, had a bad feeling about opening the chat box. I know it's never anything bad from them but a part of me felt like I shouldn't open that chatbox. But I did.\n\nIt was a screenshot of yet another personality test that they took. Then as my mind was wondering what personality test that was, they messaged me the words, \"am I really that unfriendly?\" Accompanied by a laughing emoji.\n\nFor some reason this broke the dam. I broke down seeing that message. I don't know what exactly caused it.\n\nIf it's because they never contacted me to talk about anything that I cared about.\nIf they only talk to me about what they care about.\nIf it's the fact that I knew even if I answered the conversation wouldn't even last 3 replies.\nIf I am just feeling shitty right now.\nIf I resonate so much with those words they used to question themselves.\nIf it's because I wished I was a better friend.\nIf I wished I had more people to talk to throughout the day.\nIf it's how I've been labeled selfish for not wanting to even be alive.\nIf it's because I've been trying so hard to help others with no regard for myself.\nIf it's how much I don't really feel like a self because I'm always shaping myself to others' needs.\nHow everyone actually sees me as someone who's got all their shit together while I'm always adjusting and driving myself towards a breaking point.\n\nI just don't know.\n\nI spent 8 minutes crying on my bed. It may not seem long, and I don't think it is. But sadly, this too is a cycle. I've been here before.\n\nAugust. Sunny outside. Dark room. Convenient store food. Youtube videos. Helping others. Department office. Bed. Crying while hugging a pillow. Silent phone. Just me and this diary app.\n\nIt's been 51 minutes since that message. There's still so much I haven't written yet.\n\nI should get dinner now."

I was *dying* inside.  The average for pointing is around 12 months.  When he was 15 months old I remember looking at a study that said that something like 98% of normally developing kids pointed by 15 months. I was pointing at everything for *months*, completely stressed out about it.  Then a week before 18 months old, which is basically the final, final development deadline...he started pointing.  Dang, kid.  Glad you finally got around to it.\n\nAnyway, he was behind on expressive language in general, so I put him in early intervention shortly after 12 months old.  He barely qualified (I think they may have erred on the overly-strict side so he could participate).  The early intervention people didn't really seem to think he was going to develop anything but normally from everything else they saw, despite his being behind in expressive language, but they were happy to help.  It seemed like he just ran about 6 months behind on that metric.  Progressed normally, just 6 months late.\n\nHe's four now, so how he will continue to develop remains to be seen, but his preschool teachers don't see anything off about him, so, so far, so good.  He's a happy, chatty kid now.",

I have no idea what dimension that the people who say \"nobody says it will be hard, people won't be honest about how hard it is\" are living in because it certainly wasn't mine.  (Not saying it isn't hard and sometimes frustrating, but most people seem to make out in the name of \"honesty\" that the difficulty and frustration is majority of what you will experience, not the minority.)\n\nPositive things by which I was surprised (you may or may not experience these, of course):\n\n1. A few days after my first child was born I was hit by emotions that made me feel like the entire world suddenly had so much more depth and color than I was used to.  My ability to empathize experienced a huge jump.  I'm sure it was a hormonal reaction, but it was a massive quality of life improvement.\n2. Seeing the positive things that I have passed on to my children reflected back at me really feels me with wonder.  This child is half me.  It's amazing to watch them develop.  (The less positive things, not so much, but no need to make those the focus.)  A silly anecdote, but an amusing one to me: I remember reading The Hobbit in middle school and I was the only person in class who liked it.  Started my love for Tolkien.  My daughter just read the hobbit (she's 9), and rated the book 9/10.  She kept seeking me out to sing the songs with her own tunes and repeated the riddles in the encounter with Gollum multiple times with me.  It makes me smile.\n3. There are few things better in life than to go pick your child up from pre-k when they are a toddler and watching them come sprinting over to you yelling \"MAMA!!!\" and grabbing you in a big hug.  The glee is catching.",

If you see a house selling for less than that, you are going to need a rehab loan which will push that price well into the affore mentioned $250k range.\"\n\nWe actually sold our house (in Texas) first because we wouldn't have a downpayment otherwise.  We basically put our house on the market and drove directly to Vermont to try to buy a house with enough acreage for the livestock in the <$200k range before we had to have our stuff moved out of our old one.  We ended up having about two months combined.  I think we (understandably) nearly caused my poor mother heart failure over it, and we ended up down to the wire to find one in time (and the night before we saw the house we hurriedly bought and there was no going back, I had my own \"Oh god, what if we are wrong about everything?!\" breakdown).

Some sexist old man and a creepy kidnapper woman (I love Hama, don't get me wrong)? If Yue was born a non-bender, but was instilled with bending when Tui saved her life, she could have instructed Katara in bending and Katara would have been able to learn from the source.

He had me take a comprehensive psych test to \"cover all the bases\". I have a really hard time telling the truth, but I tried pretty hard on the test. I did lie on a few questions (I know, I know) about drugs, alcohol, etc. I've been waiting for several months for the results and I finally got them today. Me and my mom go into the conference room. They talk about my IQ and how I'm too smart to have ADHD or whatever. Next, they talk about how I have unstable relationships, issues with my identity, trouble trusting, and some other stuff. I was slightly excited because I was hoping it would answer some questions. We go through all of this information just to tell me I have generalized/unspecified anxiety. I know I should be relieved to know that it isn't something big, but it doesn't feel right to me. I have terrible mood fluctuations (also mentioned in the report), a history of SH and suicidal ideation, I also experience \"highs and lows\" as well as obsessions and compulsions. All of these things had been confirmed by my therapist, who I've been seeing for quite a long time. I don't know how to tell my mom that it doesn't feel like a fit for me. I don't even get anxious very often. I just get easily frustrated/overwhelmed. I'm afraid that if I try to bring up the idea of anything a little more serious my mom will immediately shoot it down or call me dramatic. I don't know what to do. Any advice or comments are appreciated\n\nTLDR: My psych test results don't make sense to me because of symptoms that don't line up. I don't know how to tell my mom. I don't know if I'm just being dramatic.\n\n(Sorry for bad grammar/spelling. My keyboard broke, so I'm doing it on my phone.)\n\n\nUpdate: This is really old so idk why I'm putting this, but it was severe ADHD and comorbid Autism spectrum disorder lol"

Haley talks a lot about her makeup and what I'm doing on the farm. But she has not once mentioned Amethyst. She doesn't ask if I'm spending time with her or anything. I roomed with Krobus for a while and even he  said something about Amethyst. I did wipe Abby's memory, but that doesn't mean I wiped my daughter from existence. She still runs around my house and dances to the jams from the jukebox. \n\nIs this a glitch? Does Haley ruthlessly despise my daughter? If I remarried Abby, would she act like her own offspring doesn't exist? If Haley and I had a kid, would she only acknowledge him and act like he is the only child in the house?

My mom is always irritated whenever we go to the waterpark, hence she doesn't pay that much attention to me. \n\nAs i was trying to move around the pool, nothing happens. I tried using my hands and legs to move, but it just kept going down. I think my own weight outforced my attempts to swim sideways. I remember it hurt so much when i had to hold my breath underwater as i kept going down, almost reaching the floor. Until finally, it stopped hurting. Yeah. It stopped hurting, for some reason. I was confused. \n\n\"Is this the end?\" I thought to myself. I looked at the floor and the blue water all around my vision. Then, as i started to let go and accept my fate, a hand pulled me out of the water. My dad took me out of the water. I couldn't even think of anything. I was so confused. \"Did i just escape death?\" I thought to myself again. We sat down in the nearby gazeboo to dry ourselves and have some lunch.\n\nBut strangely, i felt like i shouldn't have survived. I felt like i should've drowned for good. I looked at my parents, all normal chewing on food. Maybe they didn't realize their 8 y.o kid was suffocating in the pool 5 minutes ago. Oh well, whatever.\n\nThe weirdest part is, it stopped hurting. Yes. Now i think of drowning every once in a while, it's not so bad as people make it to be. And you know, even my 8 y.o self knew that inexistence is better and more accepting than life. Strange, but it truly felt peaceful. I knew i wanted to die in that pool even before i acknowledged that life is the source of suffering."

I left my home country to relocate in his because of his job. I\u2019m a SAHM with no resources,nor support from family or friends.\n\nI wish you all could give me some advice, or tell me if the following is normal for a \u2018family man\u2019:\n\n-Going out with coworkers until who knows when, like good old single days\n\n-Drinking to the point of personality flipping 180 degrees and loss of control, not knowing if I\u2019m going to be awaken by Dr.Jekyll at 3.00 am tripping on the furniture.\n\n-Waking up your partner -after binge drink- to have circular and never ending arguments (cornering included) and not stopping despite partner begging for him to stop because it\u2019s 4 am and your partner needs to sleep.\n\n-Telling your partner -after binge drink- that her and daughter are a \u2018burden\u2019 and should go back to partner\u2019s home country or elsewhere because this is \u2018my apartment\u2019 (rented of course).\n\n-Blocking/interfering with daughter\u2019s basic routines (for example, changing diapers) -after binge drink- to get back at me (aka punishing me through our daughter).\n\n-Not having the decency to give an approximate time of coming back, leaving me worried about his state and whereabouts and depriving me of a very much needed sleep (I suffer from fibromyalgia)\n\n-Saying you\u2019re \u2018too tired\u2019 after work to take our disabled daughter for a walk or ride on her carrier, but suddenly and magically refreshed and eager to spend a lot of hours with coworkers at bars, or going out to play yu-gi-oh cards.

A otro conserje (tambi\u00e9n chileno) no quiso aceptarle la renuncia y lo mand\u00f3 de vacaciones (ya lo habia mandado mas de un mes hace tiempo).\nSegun tengo entendido, son varios los que est\u00e1n disconformes con su gesti\u00f3n -entre ellos, me incluyo- y el 7 de Agosto habr\u00e1 una asamblea para ratificar su administraci\u00f3n.\nYo le ven\u00eda recomendando a mi amiga, que grabe las interacciones con su jefa, se pague un psiquiatra que le mande algun tipo de certificado en el que conste que est\u00e1 desequilibrada por culpa de esta persona y su constante acoso -lo cual es ver\u00eddico- y use esto como evidencia para demandarla por mobbing laboral. Pero la verdad es que no se muy bien qu\u00e9 se podr\u00eda hacer; lo \u00fanico que se, es que la vieja esta deber\u00eda pagarle 2 palos para sacarla y no quiere pagarle ni uno, y se la pas\u00f3 siendo mala leche y psicop\u00e1tica con sus empleados (actuales y pasados).\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo deber\u00eda proceder ella?

I also got the parmakit cdi box for mine and advanced the timing a smidge. But that's all for an a35 so I'm not sure how that's translates to the a55.  with those differences on my a35 I was able to hit 50 on flat ground, could've gotten it further but I ran out of road. Check all your bearings too, my driveshaft bearing is crunchy AF and definitely slows me down considerably. All that being said, this is an a35 so I'm not sure how well it would translate over to the a55.",

Instead of saying it to be able to mold you into whatever they want. \nMy NDad always used love as a built in manipulator. Love wasn't a choice, I had to love him, he gave me life and allowed my existence. Everything I have ever achieved has only been because he was my father. It's not true. We as people CHOOSE who we love. And loving a person is not NEEDING a person. Not some trump card that let's you get away with abuse.\nIn a way it completely scares me, because I truly have never experienced it that way. Love is about wanting each other, not needing each other or using each other. Love isn't about what the other person can do for you, like a product."

He doesn't have a filter in his mouth and constantly berates me, and often tries to get my reaction by mooning me. When I was at middle school I remembered getting my head hit with a golf club by him.\n\nMy younger brother (m17) calls me names as well but more provocative and worse when he's in a bad mood. He also does these pranks at me, and tries to take credit for every chores or anything good I do.\n\nIt could be the fact that I'm either sensitive and easily offended or there is an underlying mental condition that makes me either harm my youngest brother or myself.\n\nI know I should ignore it when people are calling names, but when it's someone close I can't help but think the same.\n\nI've been trying to get myself to call 911 but I can't."

I don't resent him for resigning because he must've been feeling stressed out working 9 to 5 in his old job, and there was a mass dismissal back then. I think it was because the company he used to work for is experiencing some turmoil.\n\nSo we went below from being able to afford a 2 week vacation overseas to putting tabs on a 1$ dinner. After I graduated middle school, my dad decided for us to move near my maternal grandmother so we can keep in touch with family whilst looking for better job opportunity in a larger city. I got enrolled to a private high school next to my rented house so we could save money for transportation. However, the tuition fee slowly but surely started to mount and my parents could barely make ends.\n\nI feel really guilty for asking a lot of things from them and I tried eating less to hopefully lessen my parents burden but they only think I'm being ungrateful. I was really dumb to think of doing that because I have problems with low blood sugar ( I don't have diabetes )\n\nAnd now my thoughts are affecting my grades. I'm starting to lose myself and even considered kicking the bucket. This thoughts too affected my relationship with my peers, and I ended up isolating myself even from my family.\n\nI'm a pretty okay students, I'm really good at subjects like english and Biology. But I'm really lacking in math and Physics. But I don't think it's enough to even earn a scholarship. My grades are probably too below average to even pass the admission test."

Enmu's name literally just means dream or nightmare, which very closely relates to his blood demon art of entering and forcing dreams/nightmares. The other Lower moons names might clue us in on their powers/character. Kamanue (lower 6) name means kettle/boiling pot, Mukago (lower 4) means Propagule, which is a plant's spore. Wakuraba (lower 3) means diseased leaves. And Rokuro (Lower 2) means pottery wheel or ceramics wheel. Do what you will with this information, it could very well mean nothing, but I find it quite interesting, I feel like Mukago could definitely have some sort of spore ability, and Rokuro might use earth manipulation, if we're getting creative with the names.",

It can also be buffed with its Ash of War or any other buff of your choosing to bring the damage just a bit higher. \n\nPut all this together and you can obliterate entire health bars by simply holding R2 twice.",

But like you said, developing a skill takes time.   \n\nMost professional musicians have started playing their instrument in pre-teenage years, many of those probably strongly encouraged/forced by their parents. A child learner, apart from all the biological advantages of a developing brain, has the massive advantage of being able to be shit. No one will ever expect the child to play/draw/do whatever amazingly.\n\nAs an adult you and the people around you have formed all their expectations that makes sucking at something far worse than it was as a kid. Besides, the amount of encouragement you\u2019re getting from other people to push you through that will have probably decreased a lot. Maybe you even get comments like \u201cWhy are you doing it? You were never interested in it previously\u201d or you even get accused of behaving childishly. \n\nSo, in short, for many adults the negatives of practicing a new skill like drawing outweigh the positives. And so they say stuff like \u201cOh, I was never good at drawing\u201d or \u201cI just don\u2019t have the talent\u201d or whatever.",

L\u2019annonce me faisait remarquer instantan\u00e9ment, puisque je m\u2019int\u00e9resse \u00e0 la vie des affaires, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 des fa\u00e7ons dont des nouveaux d\u00e9veloppements aux entreprises peuvent contribuer \u00e0 un monde plus durable et plus vivable. \u00c9videmment, je soutiens compl\u00e8tement des sources d\u2019\u00e9nergie renouvelables. Un stage \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise le plus avanc\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de v\u00e9hicules \u00e9lectriques correspond parfaitement avec ces valeurs, et cela serait une opportunit\u00e9 unique. Par la pr\u00e9sente je voudrais poser ma candidature. \n\nPermettez-moi de me pr\u00e9senter. Je m\u2019appelle [name] et j\u2019ai [Age] ans. Pendant ma jeunesse, j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 domicili\u00e9e aussi bien aux Pays-Bas qu\u2019en Angleterre, me causant une aptitude en n\u00e9erlandais et en anglais. A c\u00f4t\u00e9 de ma ma\u00eetrise courante de ces deux langues, je parle bien le fran\u00e7ais aussi. Je crois que je suis particuli\u00e8rement fait pour le poste, parce que je suis dur \u00e0 la t\u00e2che, qui se manifeste par une attitude travailleuse et disciplin\u00e9e, et par une bonne volont\u00e9 de faire plus qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire. \u00c9galement, je suis tr\u00e8s bien capable de travailler d\u2019arrache-pied sous pression; des dates butoires ne posent pas de probl\u00e8mes pour moi. En outre, je dispose d\u2019aptitudes communicatives excellentes, ce que sont indispensables \u00e0 une entreprise \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle, comme Tesla. \n\nJ\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans le domaine commercial, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 mon travail comme vendeuse  \u00e0 un commerce de d\u00e9tail n\u00e9erlandais pour trois ann\u00e9es. Dans un environnement si stressant, il faut qu\u2019on prenne rapidement des d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9fl\u00e9chies, une adresse que j\u2019ai ma\u00eetris\u00e9. Cela m\u2019a appris \u00e0 garder mon sang-froid, pour choisir l\u2019approch la plus efficace, en tenant compte aussi bien avec les grandes lignes qu\u2019avec les d\u00e9tails d\u2019importance. \n\nComme j\u2019ai dit d\u00e9j\u00e0, le sujet de durabilit\u00e9 m\u2019int\u00e9resse beaucoup, et c\u2019est pour cela que j\u2019embrasse un style de vie \u00e9cocitoyen. \u00c0 mon avis, c\u2019est notre responsabilit\u00e9 de faire tout notre possible pour prendre soin de la terre. Bien que je me rende compte qu\u2019il y a plein du pain sur la planche, je retiens une attitude id\u00e9aliste et positive. En effet, les petits ruisseaux font les grandes rivi\u00e8res.",

To give an indication of my level; Currently working on Rachs Elegie, Bachs fugue in D major and all his inventions (side project), Mozart a minor sonata and a transcription of Peter and the Wolf from prokofiev.\n\nThe person have been playing jazz (self-taught) and have never had a piano teacher. I will not take normal rate (will just take minimum wage). However I still dont know if its ethical to teach someone. I am not even in a conservatoire yet, after all.\n\nI will recommend him getting a professional but wanted to ask you guys as well. Do you think its fine to teach him?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Just talked with him, and he says he still wants lessons even though im not a conservatoire educated pianist. I told him that i would stop teaching him the moment he got too advanced for me."

The energetic mix is called a mix for a reason, no solution is the perfect one for every places.

Oil and gas lobbies push and pull on whatever energy policy is best for them in some place, sometimes they are anti-nuclear so the market where they lost a big portion (like France) can be open to their productions for a transition time and sometimes they're pro-nuclear so they can delay the transition.

                "created_utc": 1594458930.0,
                "body": "So, there are so many people that don't see a use in MBTI, because they are confused about what it really entails, and why it's a good system of categorizing types of people.    \n\n__\n\n***MBTI is basically pseudo-Fe.***\n\n__\n\n**Fe/Ti doms/users listen:** MBTI is really a Ti framework-organzation of Fe abilities in identifying and classing people based on their cognitive preferences.  Either you have an existing framework (as a Ti user also uses Fe), or you don't need one (as Fe users are good at reading people). But for other people, it serves a very valuable tool for understanding what people want.  \n\n__\n\n**How I use MBTI:**   \n\n1. I identify the type based on either asking for them to take tests, or you simply start to get a vibe for how people react to certain things, which can lead to a specific type -> cognitive function usage.  \n\n2. Dominant function is the primary way to communicate with the other person. For an Fi dom, try to understand their fundamental morality and speak on those terms. For a Ti dom, apply logic and binary true/false explanations. For a Ni dom, talk about trends and potential futures, for a Si dom, reminisce about the past, but also about things that work(ed). Extroverted function doms are easier, as who and what they are is literally visible through their actions as a primary extroverted function user.  Adjust your own communication to match that of the other person for smooth communication.  \n\n3. The Aux function is just a function of competence for each person. It's also important to keep in mind for smooth communication, but as long as you are in line with the dom function, people will really understand you well.  \n\n4. The Tert function is a function of incompetence and pessimism. If you are strong at another person's tert function, it's the place where they need the most help, and will appreciate you for helping them out in that field. This is the function that people need help with, and will appreciate help from.  \n\n5. The Inferior function is a function of desire and incompetence.  It's essentially what people WANT, but are not good at getting.  Give them what their inferior function wants in order for them to be happy and satisfied.  Don't try to train it, because it's kind of pointless, as the functions don't develop until time passes, just entertain and help them out with it.  \n\n7. The Trixter function (7th) is one of absolute incompetence, AND distrust. Avoid interacting in this manner with other people, as they are both unwilling, distrusting and bad at communicating in this manner.  \n\n8. The Demon function (8th) is one of absolute, unconscious incompetence, and is one that is the absolute worst way to communicate with them aside from the 7th trixter function. They are just bad at it, so stick with dom/aux styles of communication for efficient and pleasant interactions.  \n\n__\n\nAs an INTJ with Trixter Fe, I literally cannot think of 16 unique different personality types that I have met, not to mention 16 different people I know closely, but it is always possible to meet any one of the 16 types, and it can only be useful to be able to apply a high-level Fe understanding of what how people **perceive**, **compute**, and **spit out outputs from identical inputs/situations**, in order to best deal with them (it's all motivated by a Te desire to become efficient with dealing with people by learning Fe).  \n\n__  \n\nRemember that:  \n- **Fi/Ti are internal frameworks of Decision making with regards to what is right, affecting oneself**  \n- **Si/Ni are internal frameworks of DATA Processing that is time-gated**  \n- **Te/Fe are external frameworks of what is Right, as it affects Things/People**  \n- **Se/Ne are external Perception Functions of the real world/abstract ideas**\n\n__\n\nAlso, same ACTIONS does not mean same reasoning (or whys) for the actions. Despite identical outputs, the inputs may differ due to differences in perception, processing of information and motivation for action.  \n__\n\nI am open to any questions or refutations. I hope this has helped a lot of people that are unsure of MBTI's usefulness, at least for Fe-deficient people like I."

Sounds toxic tbh. I think that there are people who don\u2019t care, however, and want to learn to get better at the game. So they rematch, regardless if they win/lose as to not rob themselves of an opportunity to witness a higher skilled player for example and learn from them. These people are awesome imo because they\u2019re willing to put themselves out there to fail and learn, which was all I meant by my post. But ofc, no one should feel forced to rematch. If someone doesn\u2019t want to, they shouldn\u2019t and it certainly doesn\u2019t make them cowards or wimps for just wanting to have fun. I hear there\u2019s a ranked mode coming so hopefully it will help even out the competitive and casual players more so they don\u2019t get matched together as often.\n\nHope that helped clear things up!

I am on PC and have tried:\n\nRunning as Administrator as well as giving full control and permissions to the executable files\n\nTurning off all antivirus programs, OneDrive and all overlays\n\nGoing offline\n\nLowering the resolution, even though at max res it doesn't use more than 4GB (I should note this actually worked for a few checkpoints by giving me the error only once then when restarting it works the second time. Had to do this for each checkpoint. Now that I have reached the second chapter of the first act however, even this stopped working and the same checkpoint failed for around 10 times now)\n\nRestarting Steam and the game multiple times\n\nVerifying integrity of files\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMight have to just refund if there is no way to get it working. Either way, any help would be greatly appreciated :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Some other things I tried is running Steam as an administrator and turning of firewall. Neither works...."

However, if you were to put your hand a similar position and try to move your index and middle finger, you find it is still possible. The range of movement is very limited, but its not out of the question for an organism to evolve a better musculature structure with in the forearms, and perhaps in the hand itself to an extent, to allow for better articulation. \n\nThe elongated digits serve  a few functions, but they aren't the driving force behind pinning pray. The adapted tongue and the weight of the upper body would be used to preform this hunting behavior. \n\nThe ancestors of this organism used these elongated digits  to feel ahead of them in the dark cave environments that they evolved in. Tapping of the ground provided a broad image of the surrounding cave structures through eco location. A swollen  and powerful olfactory system, externalized onto the face and tongue, aiding even further in foraging behaviors. \n\nOnce exposed to the surface again, these organisms had already lost their sight. What they once used in the caves to navigate, grew to exaggerated proportions to help them slowly and gradually make their way into a nocturnal predator niche. Their exposed olfactory system and long tongue grew large, to pick up all scents in the breeze in deep and rich complexity.  Later utilizing it as their main killing force. Its comparable to a trunk in strength and mobility.\n\nThe aforementioned elongated digits did not experience much change, aside from size and the gradual evolution of a venom that causes muscle contraction. They still serve the function of feeling out the environment through tactile stimuli, and the tapping that aids in echolocation. Additionally they aid in the transfer of scents in hunting and stalking behavior, carrying scents from the ground to the  adapted appendages at the end of the tongue.
