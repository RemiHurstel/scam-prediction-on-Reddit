It was really interesting and I kinda want to rewatch it, but I can barely remember anything about it, the title etc. So I was wondering if you could help me find this movie?\n\nAll that I can remember is that a bunch of people woke up in this house that is located on this mysterious island, and they cant remember anything. I remember one guy having weird text on his/her arm. They start exploring this island together and find out all kinds of crazy things, people that have gone crazy etc. Later they remember that they are researchers, trying to find a cure for this illness that is causing people to go crazy.\n\nI hope this helps, thanks guys!

Weddings were considered to be a family occasion and part of your early life experiences of life in the Church. And isn't the Mass/Liturgy public? Nowadays, it seems to be a widespread practice for children to be prohibited from Weddings. I wonder if banning them springs from the anti-natalism movement? (Children are a burden rather than a blessing) The Wedding in question occurred this past weekend. Enough of an inconvenience and expense  that the groom's family and friends had to travel from five states away to attend the Wedding, but in addition, were forced to find baby sitters for their kids and/or leave a baby/toddler over night. Among the children, a young teen named for the groom's grandfather whom the groom hadn't seen in years. I feel that opportunities have been missed!  The Wedding couple are all \"Oh we're pro-family, blah, blah, blah\" and then next thing you know, \"let's ban all the kids!\" I  find this so sad.\n\nEdit: \"Whom when Jesus saw, he was much displeased, and saith to them: Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.\"\n[Mark 10:14]"

If you look at google statistics and ao3, you will see that the fandom would have died without that. Killing them off would make \\~90% of the fandom leave out of spite, and with only the writers to blame.\n\nSo no, your opinion is not only stupid, I cant see how in *any* way you could have thought of that idea besides getting it from a satanic ritual./j"

So I guess it's a refurbished controller or a controller with replaced shell.   \n\n\nRight off the bat, the Chinese controller packaging is less white and more red. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7kl22o81u5ha1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=15775fd446645615b750a627018409175debaa62\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/soy43sr6v5ha1.png?width=1477&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=586c8441cd9c4122a6dd25f632b6802e7688fe6a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI couldn't verify the Chinese controller's serial number on Microsoft's website. Interestingly, I also own a white controller from the same seller, and the serial number works just fine. Maybe nobody with the same serial number bothered to check it on the website.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gnn5912v36ha1.png?width=1447&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c0f11f2b0fe40f6d94af6bcf1eabb30211f99393\n\nThe Chinese controller comes with Duracell plus batteries, whereas the genuine one comes with Duracell OEM batteries. Also, the instruction manual of the Chinese controller is somewhat thicker.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fls5rmciw5ha1.png?width=1460&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4ebee8110633fe101bd6b8a0e4306db5fd2d5625\n\nThe genuine controller has a more even texture, and its back is grippier. It appears to me that the Chinese controller texture is more red compared to the genuine controller.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjc3jm18x5ha1.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e49ddccb07914c3f7c96078ccf22e95111e66368\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gi0y94akx5ha1.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ae35a467e9a1050ee2df4542d31e9a1dc0a13228\n\nThe peripheral port of the genuine controller is thinner, and the USB C port reflects less light. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xamnrtzrx5ha1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=44834a0de8e64905e26af92505a8eb7600922871\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrzgpomfy5ha1.png?width=1477&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2c1f0f9db59bf598eb3fc5c060908e49d457df8a\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfdrofso36ha1.png?width=3987&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ac8f38cc8f88cf23dec7088cb8eac423d4c2e6e4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0te448c736ha1.png?width=1477&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a795c5fcc7301d28fa77a4a5d7791d472209649b\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/99ahvsfc36ha1.png?width=1477&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=069a3179972abf0f7413f8a93a3b9078256fedcd\n\nThis one is a dead giveaway.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hntoe5xl06ha1.png?width=1477&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e24f346dcc2bd99dba5690be1e6d6cd93705eb67\n\n  \nLast, the D-Pad buttons on the genuine controller are more clicky and more consistent. The Chinese controller has uneven clicks and sounds less crisp. [Here is the audio comparison, which starts with the genuine controller.](https://imgur.com/a/6GE9zoy)"

The stress of online classes and inability to adjust to this mode of education has caused problems in studies for students in every grade. This is especially magnified for the students who have just entered college since the level of difficulty takes a huge leap between 10th and 11th. The 12th boards are also very important exams(along with competitive exams) because they influence the quality of universities into which the students may take admission.\n\nSince most students have had difficulties covering the portion entirely in 11th and now risk going into the next grade with no basal knowledge, it is important to know what topics hold the most weight in 12th so that they may be prepared, even if partially, to effectively understand the syllabus of 12th. This may not help the ones aspiring for JEE/CET/NEET(as they require knowledge of the syllabus of both 11th and 12th), it may nevertheless help them to establish priorities so that they can study better.\n\nThis post only contains important PCM topics (Physics, Chemistry and Maths). I didn't find much advice on Biology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------Syllabus intersection----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\[Note that this is merely a compilation of all the advice given to 11th grade students on the sub before regarding important topics.\\]\n\n***Physics:***\n\n* Mathematical Methods - Vector resolution, vector addition, magnitude of a vector, dot and cross product.\n* Newton's Laws of Motion(NLM)\n* Simple Harmonic Motion(SHM)\n* Sound and Waves\n\n\\[*Dimensions* also seems to hold importance here but I've not included it for the sake of highlighting only the most important topics\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Chemistry:***\n\n* General Organic Chemistry \\[Basics of OChem and Hydrocarbons\\] - If there's any topic that needs to be thoroughly understood, it's this one. Watch videos on YouTube to grasp the concepts.\n* Chemical bonding - This describes various theories of bonding that will be necessary to understand the bonds between various molecules.\n* Structure of an Atom: The chapter of Chemical Bonding depends on this chapter entirely. As does majority of the portion.\n* Periodic Table: It describes various theories to explain the behavior and properties of elements in the periodic table. Pretty important.\n\n\\[*Mole concept, Redox reactions, Chemical equilibrium and Thermodynamics* are also topics worth understanding. However to cut to what is bare essential, I haven't included this in the normal listing\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Mathematics:***\n\n* TRIGONOMETRY: Every single person who advised 11th grade students on Maths had one thing to say very clearly - \"DO NOT SKIP TRIGONOMETRY. IT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE\".\n* Calculus: This includes Functions, Limits, Continuity and Differentiation. I recommend that you watch 3Blue1Brown's series 'Essence of Calculus'. It's way better than just reading the texts and will actually give you an idea of what you're doing as opposed to simply parroting equations and spitting them out on paper.\n* Sequences and Series: Arithmetic, Geometric and Harmonic Progressions.\n* Expansion of Binomial\n* Straight Line\n\n\\[Circle and Conic sections also seem to hold relevance but for the sake of highlighting only the most important topics, I've left them out\\]\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile studying these topics for the next grade, it would be best to maximize conceptual understanding rather than trying to solve every single numerical in the book. After all, you'll only need the concepts, not the specific questions.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nmy\\_qualifications: 11th grade"

Well, I wouldn't say that your hairline is receding; I would say that it's maturing. \n\nNow, technically speaking, hairline maturation is hairline recession since both involve your hairline moving back. However, the difference between the two is the rate at which your hairline is rising. \n\nGross Simplification: (Maturation is something that happens over the course of years, and the change that happenes with recession will be noticeable within a year.)\n\nYou're 24, it seems like your hairline has more baby hair than it previously did\u2014and it probably does indeed have more baby hair than a previous time. Given your age, and the fact that I don't see a lil M forming in your forehead, I'm going to infer that your hairline is simply maturing.\n\nThis next information is also in the article I have below, but your hair looks like it's of an appropriate length to be tied back. If you do/are tying it back, make sure that it's not too tight, cause that can cause recession.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n[Source](https://wimpoleclinic.com/blog/mature-hairline-vs-receding-hairline-whats-the-difference/)",

By that I mean not listening (which can be caused by many things), so you don't even have the source material in your brain to respond to what the other person said.

                "body": "I thought that I\u2019d post this rant here because I feel like only you guys will understand the extent to which my height affects me.\n\nSo basically all my life I was very short for my age. I never grew as much as the other kids did. I didn\u2019t have many growth spurts. However, my parents didn\u2019t take me to an endocrinologist until LAST YEAR because my dad always thought that I\u2019d grow a foot in one year in high school (because he did.) I\u2019m FTM so that\u2019s an insane belief but I believed him. \n\nAt the appointment last year I got a hand X-ray done and my bones were more mature than my actual fucking age (I was 14 and I\u2019m 16 now) so growth hormones wouldn\u2019t be an option. I got tested for a deficiency and I didn\u2019t even have that. It\u2019s so strange because my dad is 6 foot and my mom is 5\u20197. No one is my family is as fucking short as I am. My mom\u2019s great grand parents were around 5\u20194 and 5\u20196 but everyone else is average to tall. WHY THE FUCK DID I HAVE TO BE CURSED WITH MIDGET HEIGHT?\n\nOnce I got home from that appointment I bawled my eyes out. I proceeded to have at least 10 mental breakdowns over the next week. I\u2019m so pissed at my dad for not taking me to the endo sooner. And I\u2019m so pissed that either my doctors won\u2019t tell me (or they genuinely don\u2019t know) why I\u2019m a midget. \n\nBeing 4\u201910 has made me want to kill myself so much. It\u2019s the last thing I needed on top of being a transsexual. And it bothers me so much how my pediatrician and previous therapists (I have a new one now and she\u2019s great) have told me to just accept me height. And my dad acts like it\u2019s nothing. He tells me that guys like short girls. If i was a girl, my height would definitely bother me, but it wouldn\u2019t feel like the end of the world. No one seems to get that being FTM on top of this makes it ten times worse. However, both my dad and my pediatrician are convinced I\u2019m going through a phase. I wish they would at least consider that it\u2019s not.\n\nLuckily though, I\u2019m gay. So at least I won\u2019t have to deal with being shorter than my hypothetical girlfriend or being rejected by girls because I\u2019m a midget. On the other hand, some gay gays would definitely fetishize be for both my height and being trans, which is disgusting as fuck. And I don\u2019t want to be infantilized. \n\nAnd has no one talked about how terrible it is to be simply walking on the street? Or anywhere, really? When I\u2019m at school I feel so vulnerable trotting through the hallways with my tiny legs. It\u2019s fucking awful. I want to be 5\u20196 for the day. Even 5\u20190. I would kill to be 5\u20190. I know it wouldn\u2019t make that much of a difference but being a man under 5\u20190 is basically unheard of. At least here in America. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m sick of people who are 5\u20196-5\u20198 complaining how short they are. Dude, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re short for a man, at least you don\u2019t look like a fucking child like me. I\u2019m not saying that they don\u2019t have a right to complain, but they should be grateful that they\u2019re at least above female average height. Like I said, I\u2019d kill to be 5\u20190 so being 5\u20194 would be a dream.\n\nSo I guess my question is: how do I not feel like shit as a midget dude? \n\nAnd do I have at least a small chance at finding a boyfriend who\u2019ll treat me as his equal?\n\nIn addition, what countries might be better places to live for short men? I\u2019ve I\u2019ve been planning to move to Italy when I\u2019m an adult but I\u2019d still look like a midget there too, even in the south where they\u2019re shorter. And I have to keep access to HRT in mind.\n\nI\u2019m losing all fucking hope so any feedback is appreciated."

                "body": "(So first of all, I've been regularly visiting the vet for the last 2 months to try to fix this problem. They've been doing lots of tests to try to find the root cause of this vomiting, but nothing comes out.)\n\nTwo months ago, my cat (female, almost 7 years old, spayed last September 4th) started obsessing over food. Back then, I used to feed her only twice a day (once in the morning, once in the evening, which didn't seem to be a problem for a long time), but once this problem started, she would obsessively eat the whole serving in like 5 minutes. Then, minutes after, she would vomit all the food in her stomach due to this binge eating behavior. And then, after the whole day of not eating, she would vomit bile on an empty stomach. All of this started almost 3 months after spaying.\n\nSo this is when I took her to the vet for the first time. They didn't find anything strange except for a slightly inflamed stomach (compatible with lymphoplasmacytic gastritis, they said) and spleen with a moth-eaten pattern (compatible with extramedullary hematopoiesis or an inflammatory/infectious reaction). They found this through ultrasound, and everything else was under control.\n\nVets recommended to acquire an automatic feeder so I could ration her food servings throughout the day, so she doesn't binge eat. I set it to drop 6 servings every day (one every 4 hours) of 7g, except for the first one in the morning which drops 14g. This way, binge eating stopped, so she also stopped vomiting the food after eating too much.\n\nBut she kept (and still keeps) vomiting bile. She eats all of her food instantly when it drops from the automatic feeder, but then she hardly makes it through the next 4 hours without eating, she becomes so insistent asking for her food and ends up vomiting bile.\n\nAnd she's been like this for the last two months. She doesn't vomit daily, but maybe 3-4 times a week. And I'm sure that if she was to not eat for more than 4 hours, she'd 100% vomit. (I'm sure because it has happened before; she has been required to fast for 12 hours twice due to blood tests and she vomited 3-4 times within that 12 hour span.)\n\n.\n\nThese are all the tests vets did (and found no conclusive pathology related to the results):\n* 3 ultrasound scans: November 22nd (described above), November 30th (everything normal, but spleen still with moth-eaten pattern), and January 5th (same pattern in the spleen, everything else normal).\n* FIV/FeLV test: negative. (November 30th)\n* Blood test: mild leukocytosis. Amyl slightly high (2700 UI/l) (November 30th)\n* FPLI vcheck 1.1 NG/ML NORMAL (December 9th)\n* TLI+FOL+COB: everything ok, except for cyanocobalamin, which is at 4000 pg/mL. (December 14th)\n* T4: 2-NORMAL (January 5th)\n* They are contemplating doing endoscopy, gastric-intestinal biopsy, and cytology (for the spleen, I think), but not yet since it's more invasive.\n\nExtra info:\n* She's been two months into a hypoallergenic diet (kibble), since vets recommended it.\n* She maybe drinks a bit more than she used to, but not excessively (no more than 200ml per day). Vets say this is a normal amount.\n* She's overweight. She used to weigh 5.1kg before spaying. Two months ago she weighed 5.7kg, and today she weighs 5.9kg.\n* She will only eat kibble, no wet food. I've tried all kinds with no success.\n* Urinates and defecates as expected. No problems in that regard.\n\nI'd appreciate any help.\n\nThanks."

She's a very special cat in that sense, and she will not exit my room if i were to put the feeder in the living room or whatever other part of the house. So the feeder needs to be in my room.\n\nThe issue is that the automatic feeder I acquired is kinda noisy. Each time it drops food, the kibble (because she will only eat kibble) will make a loud noise when it hits the bowl. And, yeah, each time it drops food during the night it wakes me up, since I have a very light sleep and the feeder needs to be in my bedroom.\n\nSo I was wondering if there's any silent automatic feeder options out there. I don't care about price, I just want to sleep. Thank you!\n\n.\n\nEdit: And no, programming the feeder to not drop food during night is not an option. She will vomit bile if she hasn't eaten for more than 5 hours, so at least one portion needs to be during nighttime."

But in my mind it seems like a lot of work and having a vagina is familiar. Plus it's easier to make kids this way. For the longest time I've wanted kids. I'm still young so I guess I could change my mind, but it's something I have wanted since forever. The thing about breastfeeding and pregnancy is that the modern day activism and advocacy has really helped me internalize the idea of men doing those things. Anyways just kinda looking for guidance on who I am. I'm planning on cutting my hair super short this weekend. I might even start going by a guy's name and he/him pronouns."

And then there's taking everything with buddy Morgan into consideration. Opinions about him were so strong they changed the direction of the series. But nowadays the more progressive and accepting youth liked buddy's character and wished that they had had the chance to bring him back. Could geia be a response to this? Especially with Ashton Kutcher saying they did so much in the original, that if they did a reboot they would need a really good reason because there aren't a lot of storylines that they missed out on. Could gay be the missing storyline? And are people just afraid of being queerbaited?"

Back in May my period started on the 30th and didn't end until 21 days later on the 19th of June. Then about 2 weeks later I had a really heavy period for just 4 days. And now I'm 2 weeks late. It's been going on like this for a while. I had talked to my family doctor about it a year ago and he said it was probably just temporary. But I recently talked to my gastroenterologist(I have crohns), and she says I should really get it checked. So I went to my family doctor again and got a blood test. He said my hormones looked mostly normal, except my LH and FSH ratio was slightly off. I didn't see that actual numbers for anyhting though, I really wish I had asked. I'm being referred to a gynecologist-endocrinologist for an ovary scan.\n\nI didn't really know what PCOS was until today. I came home from the doctor's and things started adding up. I've been gaining weight lately, mostly on the abdomen. I've been having pelvic pains. In terms of hair, i had noticed some increased amounts of it on my chin and above my lips. Theres also some hair leading up to my belly button and on my inner upper thigh. Some of the body hair references can be confusing for me, as I am a very fair blonde. Im not noticing balding, but I'm not sure that balding is as common in my family, my grandpa is like 90 and his hair still kind of grows well all things considered. But idk. My mom never had much acne, but my dads side did. My sister tended to have more acne than me. I think I might have slightly more acne than she did when she has around my age(19). And honestly I think when I was in my earlier to mid teens my acne wasn't this much. Ive also noticed a bit more on my body than when I was younger. It also hurts more. In terms of darkened or excess skin in the underarms or neck or the leg-body intersection, I'm not entirely sure because the pictures seem unclear, maybe not. I have been experiencing mood changes and anxiety, but that could be linked to my anxiety, ADHD, crohns, or trauma. But it's also possible that all of them including PCOS are contributing factors in those symptoms."

                "body": "This is a poem I wrote about a spiritual experience. However, it was originally written in Portuguese. I translated it to English but since I'm not a native speaker, I can't be sure of how right it sounds. I sent it to a friend and he made some suggestions and corrections, but also, he might have his particular taste, and suggested some things that I feel would change the \"tone\" of the poem, which is kind of like a parable and has some idiosyncrasies. So I'd appreciate feedback on whether the choice of words work well in English, and any other helpful critique. It's under construction as I'm still changing words here and there. Thanks!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**When I went into the desert**\n\n1. I have known fear and hunger when I went into the desert, where I wandered for forty years, with no companion except for the demons that came to whisper venom in my ears during thousands (1) of frosty nights.\n\n2. During the day, the sun was bright but did not lighten, it was hot but did not warm me; its face observed me indifferent and distant, and its light revealed nothing but the arid desolation (2) of the world around me. And the desert was all there was.\n\n3. But from under the parched soil I felt a pulse, and suspected there was a life somewhere. Maybe it had been there, in days gone by, and it was the echoes of its long gone existence I was hearing; or maybe it was the patient call of the seed of something yet to come. So I dug the soil in vain, until my hands were covered in wounds.\n\n4. And there were days when I was filled with rage against the desert, and days when I just wandered, despondent and exhausted.\n\n5. And the time came when the night demons no longer muttered disturbances but proclaimed dread; soon terrors roared, and it wasn't long before they started whipping and tearing at my flesh.\n\n6. Then each night became a battle and I couldn't rest. If I behead a demon and take it as vanquished, the next night a new head would appear in its place, the hideous body from which a multiplicity of faces would sprout always the same. And against it I brandished my useless blade.\n\n7. For the help of angels I cried out and pleaded for mercy. But all the angels stood silent, except for a sole whisper: it is your war to fight and nobody else's. Was it divine wickedness, or a blessing?\n\n8. What I didn't know, I had to come to know. God is merciful and allows us to choose \u2014between Hell or growth. There was no one to teach me what direction to go. I knew true loneliness when I found myself forced to only Be. Maybe that was the subterranean force that longed to sprout out, thrusting through the ground from its obscure recesses.\n\n9. But every birth requires a death, and that sacrifice filled me with terror. By God's mercy I was able to choose between suffering or surrender; and pain lent me guidance and showed me the way.\n\n10. I was grateful for my torment. Without it, I would remain forever in the desert, where I would build towers and castles of sand, and never get to know the heart of Life.\n\n11. What a joy that I was chosen by God to delve into the darkness! How blissful that I was sent as a sacrifice to His altar! And with such joy I cried and bled through my wounds, and finally enough blood and tears soaked the desert soil.\n\n12. And the thirsty soil drank my blood and tears until they reached the heart of the Earth. And a fountain gushed out of the ground, and life sprang out from the fountain. And at once all the soil darkened with moisture and fertility, and then it flourished with greenery, and it blossomed in flowers, and the whole land was moist with life, and life was the only truth and all existence, and the desert never was, it never was, no desert has ever been.  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n(1) My friend said the use of two different numbers so close together in the same phrase (\"forty\" and \"thousands\") doesn't sound elegant in English, but I'm not sure about it.\n\n(2) Could I use \"aridness\" instead of \"arid desolation\" here? I originally used \"aridity\" as a direct translation from my language but my friend told me it was an odd word to use in English.  \n\n\nFeedback in posts: [\\[link 1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/s678d9/shadow_puppets/) [\\[link 2\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/s79ybl/the_giant_arbutus/)"

I read some articles on the allegedly benefits of the L. reuteri strain, and decided to give it a try. I purchased BioGaia's chewables.\n\nI'm already taking probiotic yogurt (Activia) and it seems to be doing me good, so it got me excited.\n\nHowever, after taking the L. reuteri tablets for 3 or 4 days, I start feeling lethargic and fatigued, have headaches and a \"feverish\" feeling, and a bit of a runny nose. This has happened twice, and I stopped the tablets after that.\n\nI researched a bit and discovered that some probiotics produce histamine. At the same time I connected the dots and found that I possibly have histamine intolerance (I have occasional eczema that flares up with some foods/drinks, hay fever, some digestive problems).\n\nHowever. L. reuteri seems to be a bit ambiguous, according to what I've read: it produces histamine, but it also suppresses inflammatory molecules and it's supposed to help with eczema and inflammation.\n\nI know there might be a period of adaptation when we start taking probiotics in which there can be some unpleasant symptoms, but they are gone after a while and we get the benefits of an improved microbiome.\n\nSo I was wondering if anyone has experience or knowledge to help me decide on whether it's a good idea to keep taking it or not. Will maybe these symptoms go away if I keep taking it, or should them be taken as a sign to just stop it?"

                "body": "The eighth Prime Minister election of the United States was held on March 10th, 1837, after the Second Sergeant-Van Buren Administration from 1837 to 1843. With his administration with President Sergeant regarded mostly as a moderate success, Van Buren left office with a generally favorable popularity level. Van Buren, recognizing the precedent set by John Marshall, refused to run for a third term.\n\nThe 1843 election also saw direct campaigning for Prime Minister for the first time. Prior to this election, Prime Minister elections were seen as a matter that was exclusive to members of Congress. However, from now on, Prime Minister campaigns would advertise voting for a specific party for the House elections in order to indirectly select a Prime Minister.\n\nThe issues in this election include relations with Texas, infrastructure, the further containment of slavery, and the British colony of Oregon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlkaus14h3u91.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4d79827fad17370b445a2d2175727588c7caf853\n\n**Lewis Cass** is a former Governor of the Michigan Territory and an Ambassador to France. Belonging to the Whig Party, he generally supports continuing the policies of Martin Van Buren. He supports:\n\n* A negotiated annexation of Oregon. As settlers arrive at and travel through the Iowa and Unorganized Territories, many find themselves inside the British-controlled Oregon Colony, causing occasional conflicts between American settlers and British troops. Calls for \"Manifest Destiny\" also include the annexation of Oregon to reach the Pacific Ocean.\n* Popular Sovereignty. Any new state admitted after the civil war was destined to be a Free State after the conclusion of the American Civil War, a state where slavery is illegal. However, debate began in Arkansas over its slavery policy. Although it joined the Confederation as a territory, it was never a seceding state, leading many to advocate slavery's abolition there. Cass calls for the state to hold a referendum about the status of slavery.\n* States' rights on infrastructure. Cass favors a system similar to that of late reconstruction, where the federal government would regularly grant each state a small sum of money specifically for building more infrastructure. Cass believes that letting individual states and localities build infrastructure would be more efficient.\n\n**Henry Clay**, a long-time figure in the National Party, is back for a second try for Prime Minister. Having previously ran for Prime Minister in 1831, Clay advocates for the following:\n\n* No expansion. Clay favors \"American territory as it is, and the northern-southern balance as it is\". This means that he opposes both the annexation of Oregon and Texas because he fears a war with Britain or Texas, and upsetting the balance between the North and the South.\n* Higher tariffs on Texas. Clay claims that the easiest place to collect more taxes for national projects is tariffs, especially on Texas since the current tariffs on the Texan Confederation are significantly lower than that of Europe's.\n* National funding on infrastructure. Clay favors putting more resources for the Federal Government to build dams, bridges, and railways across the United States. He believes that the entire US should be a \"coherent, well-connected bloc\".\n\n**John Tyler** is the nominee of a Frontiers' Party, which split from the Whig Party shortly after the nomination of Lewis Cass due to differences on slavery and Texan annexation. He supports the following:\n\n* Texan annexation. Tyler is the only candidate who favors annexing Texas into the United States by \"whatever means necessary\", including an invasion of the country. He believes that this would resolve the slavery issue and bring the country into unity again. He also believes that it would bring the US a lot of resources.\n* No containment of slavery. Tyler advocates for the choice of all states below the Mason-Dixon Line to become slave states, controversially including Missouri, Arkansas, and potentially Texas. Tyler claims that the containment of slavery is a \"relic of civil war-era division\".\n* Decreased funding on infrastructure. Tyler supports reducing funds for infrastructure in general, and wishes to cut taxes (including many tariffs) as well as major spending.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Radicalist Party was internally divided on the issue of slavery and Texan annexation. The moderates, called the \"Fusionist Radicalists\", supported Texan annexation and the status quo policy on slavery, and they endorsed Tyler for President. The more radical \"Straight-Radicalists\" supported complete abolition of slavery as a part of their efforts to remove southern culture, and are considered more of the Old Guard of the party. They nominated **James G. Birney** for President, but he is only available as a write-in.\n\n**Joseph Smith**, the founder of Mormonism, started and was nominated by the National Reform Party, which advocates for protection of Mormons from perceived persecution, a strong national bank, and the annexation of Texas and Oregon. He is also a write-in candidate.\n\n*(Write in these candidates by selecting the \"Write-in\" option and commenting \"I write in \\[Candidate's Name\\]\".)*\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/y5i5z1)"

Some suggested Van Buren to reverse removal without Congressional approval, and he would be successful if he had the support of the President or a majority of the cabinet. However, he controversially refused to, citing the constitutional supremacy of the legislature.\n\nVan Buren had to wait 1.5 months for the bill to finally be passed and signed. By then, several tribes had already been relocated to the Louisiana Territory. The estimated death toll of the natives from Indian Removal is estimated to be around 6,200.\n\n[A depiction of the \\\\\"Trail of Diseases\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/vjaq9izqbes91.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5c2d07a44321a4037edc692e99e789a5efb405c6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TEXAS**\n\nIn 1838, the civil war in Mexico between the Pro-Iturbide loyalists and the conservatives finally ended, with a conservative victory. Santa Anna was placed as the President of the Mexican Republic, and Iturbide was executed via firing squad. Negotiations between Texan leaders and the conservatives resulted in de-jure independence for Texas.\n\nVan Buren saw Texas as a trading partner and a regional ally. Pushing for lowered tariffs with Texas and establishing foreign relations in Congress, Van Buren hoped that friendlier relations would lessen the ongoing problem of slave smuggling. However, Congress (and the President) rejected this, and viewed Texas as a neutral country at best, and somewhat of an enemy at worst.\n\nThe following presidential election in Texas resulted in a landslide reelection of Chief Minister John C. Calhoun, against the pro-annexation Sam Houston, demonstrating the unwillingness of Texas to seek annexation into the United States. A growing expansionist movement grew in the US in response, seeking to militarily invade Texas to restrict slavery and gather resources there.\n\n[An exiled Calhoun, now serving as the Chief Minister of Texas](https://preview.redd.it/ni6jh1s2ces91.png?width=247&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e3f85d01771d8ec31f255a92c91d02c0dd49b65f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE NATIONAL BANK**\n\nVan Buren pushed for the replacement of the National Bank with a more decentralized independent treasury. Supported by his Whig Party, the bill passed the House but narrowly failed the Senate. Instead, Congress proposed and passed a bill to expand the powers of the central bank in order to fund more infrastructure, mainly written by the National Party. It passed the Senate, but was vetoed by Prime Minister Van Buren - a rare act that he could do with the support of a majority of the cabinet.\n\n[First Bank of the United States](https://preview.redd.it/bo31qimices91.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f659c35a90420aada46289e008485cbfd2fd3519)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RELATIONS WITH BRITAIN**\n\nDue to the civil war about two decades prior, the United States and Britain never resolved the often contested and vague northern border of the US. One of the most contested areas along this border is in Maine, resulting in a conflict known as the Aroostook War. Settlers from both British North America and the United States entered the disputed territory in Maine, gathering resources and making temporary or permanent settlements. Through the years, the situation slowly escalated, as civilians from both sides threatened to use firearms to chase off the other side.\n\nThe crisis escalated into a \"war\" when British troops entered the territory in an attempt to resolve the situation. Americans saw this as an invasion, and organized a militia, containing a significant number of veterans from the civil war, where Maine was one of the battlegrounds for a small conflict between Britain and the Union.\n\nVarious people pushed for the mobilization of federal troops there, a move that President Sergeant rejected. The situation was resolved through a treaty between the two countries, which drew a compromise border in Maine, and the 49th parallel as the new border between the US and British North America west of Michigan. The treaty would be effective in late 1843.\n\nHowever, by this time, skirmishes had costed the lives of 7 men on the American side, and 9 on the British side. \n\n[Map of the United States and Texas, 1843](https://preview.redd.it/kq7eozkkces91.png?width=1556&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a50053f5ffbdf809bf694e5d0dcc8e23a479a39b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you approve of the Second Sergeant-Van Buren Administration?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/xy15tl)"

                "body": "The seventh Prime Minister election of the United States was held on March 13th, 1837, after the Sergeant-Harrison administration, from 1831 to 1837. After the Nullification Crisis and a very controversial removal of Indians into the Louisiana Territory, Prime Minister William Henry Harrison had become very unpopular by 1837, and only had the increasingly unpassionate backing of his most loyal supporters. Thus, Harrison refused to run for reelection, and John Marshall remained the only Prime Minister who was successfully reelected.\n\nWith Indian Removal and tariffs in fresh memory due to Harrison's policies, the election mainly revolved around natives, tariffs, the legacy of William Henry Harrison, and the Texan Confederation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0j5ayflsdq91.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=17be2e2897ebb9d74a9ae5f549301b7dd445bfc7\n\n**Martin Van Buren** of the Whig Party is back, and he's back with a vengeance. The former Prime Minister narrowly lost reelection in the previous election by 1 vote, and he still supports the same policies that he advocated back in 1831. His positions are:\n\n* Radical opposition to Indian Removal. Van Buren continues to strongly oppose forcibly relocating native tribes to the Louisiana Territory. Van Buren consider Indian Removal an act that tramples on states' rights, peace with the natives, and the Constitution, and favors immediately halting removal as soon as possible. Van Buren was one of the most outspoken opponents of the Indian Protection and Relocation Act when it was first proposed.\n* Low tariffs. Van Buren increasingly emphasized the need for lower tariffs during the Sergeant-Harrison Administration, particularly because Harrison's proposal for drastically increasing tariffs on both imports and exports nearly caused the Deep South to plunge into a recession.\n* Improved relations with Texas. With the Mexican Civil War still ongoing between the conservatives and the Pro-Iturbide loyalists, Texas declared independence as the Texan Confederation, occupying parts of Mexico outside of the Texan province. Slave smuggling still occasionally occurs between Texas and the United States, and Van Buren seeks to solve the issue diplomatically.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Francis Granger** is the Radicalist nominee for Prime Minister, sharing the same party with Harrison. He is a member of the House of Representatives, representing New York's 26 District. A member of the moderate wing of the Radicalist Party, he has the following positions:\n\n* Continuation of Indian Removal. Granger advocates for maintaining the status quo of removing the Five Tecumseh Tribes from the Rust Belt states to the Louisiana Territory. He opposes additional removal of tribes outside of the ones that are mentioned in the Indian Protection and Relocation Act, but promises to continue to enforce the act.\n* Higher tariffs. Granger supports 20% to 25% increases on tariffs regarding industrial imports and agricultural imports, while opposing additional tariffs on exports. Granger claims that this will protect American industries and prevent foreign companies from out-competing American ones.\n* Being tough on Texas. Granger supports \"a policy of strength and tough defense against the Texan Confederation\", meaning that he supports increasing funding to strengthen the American-Texan border, tariffs on Texas, and improved relations with Mexico. He views Texas as a \"haven for defeated Confederates\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Daniel Webster** is a Senator from Massachusetts and the National nominee for Prime Minister. Webster runs on a platform of moderation and compromise, and has the following positions:\n\n* Moderate opposition to Indian Removal. Having voted against the Indian Protection and Relocation Act, Webster opposes Indian Removal as a policy, especially in the form that had been in place during Harrison's tenure as Prime Minister. Webster favors a compromise that would gradually end the removal - natives on their way to Louisiana would be removed, while natives that are currently untouched would be allowed to stay in their territory.\n* A stronger national bank. Policies have been implemented to moderately shrink the role of the central bank, and Harrison led many efforts to shift economic power from the central bank to small private banks in the north. Webster opposes this, and favors the re-centalization of economic power back into the national bank.\n* Neutrality on Texas. When asked about the Texan Confederation, Webster responded by saying that the United States should \"maintain the current relations with the Texas as things currently stand\". Webster opposes building a wall or fence along the Texan-American border to reduce slave smuggling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs Van the man, or is he used up? Will Henry Clay's ideas live on through Webster? Will Granger pull an upset and win, despite an unpopular incumbent? Only time can tell.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/xpddle)"

The sounds becomes clearly audible when I put the charger next to my ear. The magsafe charger comes from a smart phone shop that is legit and has multiple shops in my country but is not an official retailer.\nCan anyone reassure me this is normal/benign? I know this sounds like paranoia or conspiracy but I\u2019ve been using it for a few weeks and there was an access to my email with a device I did not recognize. ( I did already secure the account, delete it as device and change password to a robust one, tho the one I was using before is already robust)\nBut on a more rational view, as my charger also gets kind of hot, not painful but uncomfortable at the start only cooling down in a matter of hours, I\u2019m worried about my battery.\nThank you :)\n\nEdit : I hear a similar noise from my wireless belkin charging station so the idea of stolen data is not likely and I was just paranoid, still worried about battery life and heat tho"

I have had better success with AMD, as there's countless forums about issues, and getting them solved/ inception of open source modded drivers, A BIG PLUS.\n\nWould like to save money, but because of the 7000 series being 2.5x the performance of the 6900xt and inception of RDNA 3 with MCM+ stacking IMC's, I am wondering if the overall cost would justify just saving the money till I get the 7900xt, or would it be wise to just buy the 6900xt for now, and sell the 6900xt when the 7900xt comes out?\n\nI want to hear what you all think would be the wisest choice.  \n\n\nEDIT: Holy cow, this post blew up.  **56.1k** total views, 81% upvote rate, and 71 upvotes, I have decided based on the sheer advice on this subreddit to hold till 7900 series card, till the 7950xt comes out.

Though, I've known her for years even met her back in high school, though we didn't speak a lot and then reestablished communication 4 years ago and never thought I'd fall for her, until 1 year ago I started to have feelings for her. I did test the waters by sending flirtatious or more \"risqu\u00e9\" messages where it would really be out of character for me to even flirt with someone if I only see them platonically; at first she'd ignore them but still be on topic of what we talked about but at some point I wasn't entirely sure if she was just paying along or giving me a pass. And that would happen for a span of a couple of days and then she'd some times initiate so I just went along with it, also invited me over to ha e brunch which we usually don't eat out together due to our schedule not meeting up.\nAnd then we grazed upon the subject of what we wanted later in life like building a family, aspirations, wants and needs, etc. At that point let's say it was easier for me to just push down my feelings and \"move on\" (clearly, I haven't) as we didn't want the same things. But months later, on my birthday, I decided to cook ramen for my friends and invited her over to eat the first time and everything went well. I'm not entirely sure what took over me but when she said that the ramen tasted really good it suddenly flipped a switch, no matter how many compliments and handshakes I've gotten from friends and family, it doesn't hit the same as it's coming from her while having a smile on her face and if I had to dedicate my cooking to someone; it'd be her. Aside that, every time I talked or hung out with her she'd give me a sense of comfort and I can absolutely be vulnerable with her, unlike other friends from the opposite gender. And honestly I'm getting awkward around her if it's just the two of us.\n\nThe reason why I haven't told her anything yet, is due to the unspoken \"rule\" that if I'm friends with someone of the opposite gender it's a hard rule that I'm just her friend and should not betray that trust between the two of us. And knowing her it would put a lot of pressure on her if I just pour it all out. That, I want to avoid.\nBut then I also have a thing where it would take a lot of time and thought for me to even like someone, which that \"rule\" is kind of in the way.\nShould I just tell her casually? Should I just not pursue and move on? Should I just take a step back and reassess? Talk to her about it? Like how do I approach this situation the right way?"

Well it didn't and I started to make excuses such as professors actually sucking at teaching online, the pace they actually teach at as well, connectivity issues and health issues. Lost lots of motivation and as you can already guess it really wasn't good for my grades. \nThen I started to distract myself from those problems by cooking for friends and family, playing video games, watching anime and helping out with the more important group projects just so I'll be able to hide it just a tiny bit.\nSomewhere along the middle of it I developed some kind of anxiety where if I'm outside alone during the daylight in a fairly crowded area, I get really itchy, hot and edgy, but I think this is another problem on its own.\n I really want to continue with Data Science since it really is interesting but I think they're gonna make me quit since I'm gonna have below 30% grade.\nI just want this to stop for my own good but I don't even listen to myself anymore.

Basically I understand it as, if there's a boundary to what counts as yourself, then people should be able to count something 'not themselves' outside themselves, or else the very concept of 'self' would lose a logical basis and a logical meaning.\n\nThat thing outside ourselves is thus called the reality which we can partially understand. If we can agree many apples are red, it means we're able to identify something as red universally as humans, even if we aren't entirely sure if each of us experience the color red differently. So it means many parts of reality doesn't mandate itself to be defined within the self. Reality is our origin of perception. If there is an objective reality, then probably, perception is not reality. \n\nYour corrections will be welcome but this is basically my simplified understanding.",

For anyone reading I'd like to add examples for the sheer scale of adoption as to how OP they are.\n\nRocket for example, can hand build atomic weapons in one ship trip which is essentially the galactic version of building something from a box of scraps. \n\nAndromedans also handle immense power with much more elegance and ease compared to humans, like how light-speed travel can be harnessed with the space stone on board the Skrull ships 30+ years before the current MCU year. Portal based travel is available via jumps. A weapon from a Kree lieutenant is able to contain and stabilise the power stone so Ronan could just stuff it in and become a galactic terrorist within 5 seconds. A wormhole generator was referred to as an 'ancient' Kree artifact (Monolith). A Kree AI can handle the internal politics of its own galactic empire. \n\nAnd remember, all Asgardian and Nidavelliran tech technically also belongs in the cosmic level too. It's where Thanos had his gauntlet made. And literally just give coordinates to Rocket and he'll bring Thor to the neutron star on a small maintenance ship. It's just another Tuesday.\n\nIt is quite heavily implied that the amount of knowledge exchange in the galaxy is what makes it so mainstream. And that's a big point; we view the label 'heroes' as accomplished individuals while galactic heros, especially for the GotG realm, more than often than not break that mold by portraying how they hail from their homes as commoners using what they consider as contemporary technology with their own bleeding edges sometimes. Rarely would they go heads over their peers like how Tony was. When one of them do, we get that mf called Thanos. But it must be mind-blowing for any human to visit the galaxy. It'll be humbling like how it is graduating top of your Grade in your middle school and then stumbling into a senior lecture in Harvard months later. The rather standard armament for Quill in your example was excellent proof of that.\n\nA scientific way to compare civilisations is to use metrics to measure the amount of harnessed energy on a cosmic POV with the Kardashev scale. That W often goes to the Galaxy dwellers as they are clearly Type I while Terrans were not even close to reaching it yet with one exception in Tony Stark, who hinted at the potential of bringing Earth to that future, but died to save it first and foremost. It is hard to argue that one individual is enough to represent technology broadly in service of the wider population though.\n\nApparently this pissed off some fans enough that my case makes for an easy target for downvotes so idk. Unless the comics-level Dr. Doom debuts, I don't think this assessment would change any time soon. For now I'd like to leave this with a line from Rocket - 'You're only a genius on Earth, Pal'.",

                "created_utc": 1638112555.0,
                "body": "After finishing my second watch of Shang Chi with my ma, I feel like expressing my thoughts and feelings of the movie from the perspective of an Asian Chinese.\n\nI can find many MCU movies that I can like. But to *connect* with a movie takes a combination of many things. The last time I felt something strong emotionally, was with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1. Shang Chi does that, this time on a similiarly fundamental, but cultural level.\n\nI'll preface by saying, I was born and still lived in Hong Kong, a speck of dust in the large place that is Asia. To claim that Shang Chi is able to represent Asia, is crude and too sweeping. Rather, this movie is supposed to best fit a *Han Chinese* context.\n\n**Lifestyles and Family**    \n\u300c\u5443\uff0c\u4f60\u5011\u751a\u9ebd\u6642\u5019\u7d50\u5a5a\u554a\uff1f\u300d(*'Hey, when will you marry?'*)\n\nNo, we don't really live in Chinese tulous anymore, or walled villages, far from that. That distinction was what the first act of the movies depicted - Urban Chinese life. Over the last 200 years, some part of Western culture were already absorbed into the Chinese life and shaped what is 'modern'. We were born into this lifestyle.\n\nGranted, they fit more the life of ABCs (American Born Chinese), but many of the practices remain the same; we live in small apartments of 4 to 5, speak in our regional dialects, honour our passed elders on Ching Ming, gather up and eat congee and soup round a table, and talk about life. The rather accurate slice-of-life is very dear and relatable to our very daily lives. And yes, that question up top is asked every time at the table, just like you guys.\n\n**Names and the Collective**    \n*'Names are sacred... They connect us not only to ourselves, but to everyone else who came before.'*\n\nThis is where we talk about Wenwu. A thousand-year-long ruler, he was a representation of the many traditions he preserved. The architecture and arts were still there. He worked outside, and left much of the actual upbringing to the mother. But he still called the shots. He was patriachal, stern, strong-willed, stubborn and authoritative. In fact, so much of him was pure tradition that after the wife's death, he held a fist in managing his business, he still longed for a 'complete' family, and he cared a little too much about his son and daughter that he practically surveilled them. \n\nBut these were just very superficial levels of love, or a misconstrued interpretation of it, cursed by culture. He's the caricature of old-school Chinese parenting, a persistent trend that didn't begin to fade until the Boomer generation post-WWII, and arguably still didn't completely today. He represents traditional Chinese culture, often in its ill-adapted forms in the face of modern values. That was the angle I can totally relate to Shang Chi. \n\nCulturally, The Ten Rings in Shaun's childhood can actually be thought as a caricature of the 'collective good' of a Chinese family, at its worst. Shang Chi wasn't guided to a person he wanted to become. Rather, he was ordered around to do things for the collective, for the 'clan'. Your life path is determined from your birth; it really isn't about you, it's the family business, for decades and maybe centuries, work left by ancestors with the same last name as you. It clicked with me when Wenwu talked about *names* during dinner - One dictionary meaning for a Chinese 'clan', is just your surname.\n\nEdit: A interesting observation credit to /u/tehawesomedragon: Besides the family name, the characters also went on to use/present their given names quite differently depending on their circumstances. 'Katy' and 'Shaun' out of a need to fit in English speaking lifestyles, as opposed to Xialing who doesn't have that need, whereas Wenwu was adamant about holding to his name and title, demanding respect from it.\n\n**Yin and Yang, Good and Bad**    \n*'The legacy of the family, the good and the bad, it is all who you are.'*\n\nIn stark contrast, Ying Li had shown some of the best qualities about Chinese parenting. A deep, selfless love that always put their children's wellbeing first. The warmth in Ying Li came from genuine, motherly care; not a materialistic goal or achievement for any arbitrary group. She wanted their children to be both capable *and* kind. Similiar to Wenwu, she would impart teachings to her children at every chance but with kindness and patience, wisdoms about life that is a balance intertwining the material and the moral, in the absence of which, cast both Xia Ling and Shang Chi lost in life.\n\nInterestingly, themes of Yin and Yang in this movie are being essentially juxtaposed - Where the feminine, motherly, and 'weak' auras in people are generally described with Yin, the movie chose to use color schemes to associate Ying Li with Yang, for her warmth, love and care. And where the masculine, fatherly, and 'strong' auras were associated with Yang conventionally, Wenwu was most definitely portrayed Yin, for his darkness and calculating demeanor. Yin/Yang is a subject very intricately connected with Tai Chi, the art of balance, deliberately shown to be the style in Ta Lo. Here I think the movie deliberately used them to associate good and bad. \n\n\n**Choices**\n\nThe struggle in Shang Chi is one with morals - He has the teachings of both a conqueror and a hermit, of both outer chaos and inner peace, expressed in opposing schools of martial arts. Should he choose to resort to violence to avenge his mother? Would he choose to maintain peace by defending Ta Lo? Would he use his rage to kill his father? \n\nShang Chi's path is actually entirely traceable in his change of fighting style. He was in rage as he bears the baggage of his ancestors, but ultimately, with guidance from his elders, he found balance and made the right choice, to defeat but spare his father, reflecting the ancient Chinese wisdom:\n  \n    \u300c\u6b62\u6208\u70ba\u6b66\u3002\u300d    \n\nLook how the shapes of two characters is put together to form a new one: To stop\u300c\u6b62\u300dviolence\u300c\u6208\u300d, is true martial arts\u300c\u6b66\u300d.\n\nWe are what we are, but it is also the good and bad choices we make that defines the person we'd be.\n\n**Conclusion**    \n*'You are a product of all who came before you.'*\n\nI think this quotes sums up Chinese culture quite succinctly. It was traditionally accepted for young Chinese to be told what to do and what not to, often without explanation. But as we grow up, we often transition from making choices out of what we're to told to, to making choices ourselves. The world changes fast, and when that realization hits you, that not all things you were taught or told to do was right for you, at what point do you ask why? When would you choose what values to keep, and what to change? When would you stop hiding, and take full responsibility of the choices you make, and thus your life? That is the question I have for Gen Y and Z Chinese; one that I have yet to fully answer myself."

I pitched this idea back at May, he replied that he had plans in August, and went a bit undecided. A lazy yes was what I remembered I got so I assume I would have to do the planning this time. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, the day was about to end just as it normally would, when he busted in at 1:30 am and told me that he would be going with another one on September 13 instead, to the same place, tickets booked. He asked if I would join the two, and I have to say no for not wanting to be an odd ball between the two like I've always felt, to both of us I think we both know are just pure courtesy at this point. 'Well I know you always wanted someone to accompany on the trip'. Excuse me but what I had in mind for the trip isn't just me?\n\nThat was where I think the gaslight began. He pointed out he was sure that he outright refused me back then because of his plans. So that's a little different than what I've remember, and I even went through an effort for planning for two. I refrained from arguing about who said what for the time being but he pressed on saying I couldn't blame him on this, because this was what he remembered, I shouldn't be so disappointed because he would rather prefer a solid date set like his girlfriend. The thing is I don't even realise it was an option, back in May. Else I would've already put it higher on the list. *Now* he told me he got all his leave schedule and stuff sorted out and ready too.\n\nWell now my plans for leave are pretty much 50% foiled, can't say I'm exactly happy. I admit that keeping my plans in the dark costed me. But the gaslighting really really bothered me, because this isn't the first time he was 100% sure about something he never said/ said in the complete opposite way, and hasn't only ever happened to me.\n\nIf he really cared enough wouldn't he be more engaging when I told him about the idea in May then come sort out a timeframe for me to start from? I'm starting to think he probably had that someone in mind without a good reason to refuse me, then just found the perfect storm to go along with this time.\n\n I felt defeated that I even tried, just hope I could really find an even better use of my paid leave now."

I'd rather do my school work, play video games, and watch youtube. I rarely smoke weed or go to parties. I haven't made any long standing friends over the course of the last 3 years. Every opportunity I've had with girls I've scrutinized to the point that its redundant. I hate saying this, but I'm pretty damn smart. I was in gifted and well that's all there is to say about that. I hate saying it because it makes me sound narcissistic.\n\nI don't know if I have SPD, aspergers, avoidant, borderline, or etc. I experience suicidal thoughts almost daily. I've never hurt myself and have no intention acting on the thoughts. This last weekend I went to my parents house from university. I hardly talked to them at all. I went to go see a movie by myself so that I could get away from it all. I'm overwhelmed with life right now. This has been a long term problem. I'm afraid. Im afraid of going to see a therapist and sharing them my thoughts. I feel so damaged. I despise talking to people because of how mean they can be. It's easier to get away from them.\n\nI doubt it'll help but I guess I'll go try to put a nail in this problem. I feel like it's pointless..."

Why is my memory so bad and why so i suck at socialising??\n\nFlashbacks to when i was terribly bullied in school for it kept popping up and I just wanted to hide away.

I was so put off by it that when i was swapped to a non-stimulant (Strattera), I still wouldnt drink caffeinated coffee after my experience because I still felt jittery for some reason. A year later I decided to drink a coffee again now that I'm not so scarred by my experience but I still suffered with being too hyped up and jittery to the point it was mildly uncomfortable and distracting. I heard that people who were also autistic didn't react as positively to medication treating ADHD. I'm wondering if this is why I'm still having these problems with caffeine or maybe it is placebo from past experiences? I guess whats confusing to me is why I'm jittery on coffee when I'm now on a non-stimulant medication. I want to be able to drink coffee like I used to because it helped my digestive issues.\n\nP.S. I don't know if its worth mentioning but I went without caffienated coffee for a whole year after being essentially addicted to it from 12 years old to 22 years old. I'm talking 4 cups a day every day. If theres any other questions you guys need to help with answering my query I am happy to answer them. I just really want to know why this is happening and if theres a way i can consume coffee again."

But there is no comparison because the one time doesn't have anything to do with the other.\n\nMaybe it's best to think of your life like it's a video game and you are playing against your parallel universe selfs to get the high score for that prewritten story with the options that are available to you."

But, towards the end of the year he asked me to shovel snow/salt during the winter for him even after I was laid off and collecting unemployment. He has contracts with businesses around our city to plow, shovel and salt for them. He was of course going to pay me for hours worked but he said that if I don't do it for him he would tell unemployment that I wasn't accepting work. My problem is that there is no schedule and he wants me to go in whenever asked, sometimes within a one hour notice at 3am. Then he just told me yesterday he had a job offer, just a small project to do for one maybe two days and expects me to come in, if I say no. He might tell unemployment. He is also pooling our hours until we get 40 then paying us once we get 40. Whether it takes 1 week to 2 months. I don't think it's right he expects me to come in whenever asked once he laid me off, is any of this even legal? Am I supposed to go in for the work? I don't feel like it's considered adequate work."

Am I seriously talking to a computer right now and expecting an answer?\u201d He said, chuckling to himself. \n\n\u201c*Affirmative*\u201d\n\nThe demon was startled, and his readers fell off his face.\n\n\u201cOh, right, voice recordings, that\u2019s great.\u201d He turned to rest of the room, feeling around for his readers. \n\n\u201cI gotta admit, this pentagram and candles were drawn real nice, whoever you are you can come out. you got me good, come on out and tell me how you made the computer talk.\u201d\n\n\u201c*The scientists here are dead, I killed them.*\u201d\n\nThe demon froze, and turned slowly around to look at the monitor.\n\n\u201cWow, that computer is creepy, I almost believed it, you programmed it with great creepy timing. this is seriously really well set up. I was going to eat you before but now I want you alive, we could always use good subcontractors up here\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c*There is nobody here to subcontract to, I told you I killed them.*\u201d\n\nThe demon blinked as his head magically blinked back to its true form instead of the scary skull and bleeding flesh ruse he puts on during normal summons. He wanted to look at this thing with his real eyes. \n\n\u201cIs that so? And why is that?\u201d He held up his readers to the light of the incandescent rods in the ceiling and muttered to himself.  He was reminded how much he hated the damn lights they put in the offices as he cleaned the lens on a red silk handkerchief. \n\nNo response.\n\nThe demon stood there, squinting through the tiny lenses at the computer, waiting for a response.\n\nAfter a beat with still no response, the demon tried something else.\n\n\u201cYou know, most humans hate these kinds of lights and they think *we* must have had something to do with \u2018em, but nope. That was the humans who made them. In fact, since their Industrial Revolution, most of the evil done up here is mostly handled by the humans themselves, we just stoke the proverbial fires, if you will. It\u2019s a pretty slick set up, I\u2019ll be honest.\u201d\n\nNothing.\n\n\u201c\u2026millennia ago we\u2019d come up, scare a couple of them in a village, make them so scared they\u2019d either go crazy and hurt others in their village and I\u2019d get a little bonus, and I\u2019d just ride that wave for a couple days until one of them eventually got the bright idea to pray and that was the end of that gig. It was a pretty cozy set up.\u201d\n\nThe candles on the floor flickered.\n\n\u201cThe humans were simpler then, which meant pretty much guaranteed work, albeit a little boring. But nowadays, sheesh.\u201d he looked around the room at the all the blinking lights on the stacks and stacks of thin black boxes in rows and rows, and brightly colored wires running through all of them.\n\n\u201cWe hardly have to think of too much. They do it to themselves for the most part. Well, credit where credit is due, *most* humans are fine. Most of them I\u2019d say genuinely want to do good **blech**, it\u2019s really actually only a few of them comparatively that do the bad. And they\u2019re not even inherently bad, they just succumb to the temptations and their pour souls can\u2019t handle it, and get caught up in it. Unfortunately by that point they\u2019re usually deemed too far gone by everyone else, but they\u2019re not actually evil. *Every* one of them has the capacity for good, so we can\u2019t take them until they do enough bad to outweigh their potential good.\u201d\n\nThe demon realized he said the word \u2018soul\u2019 and remembered why he was here in the first place. He looked at pentagram on the ground, this time actually looking closer at it.\n\n\u201cThese lines, they are drawn way straighter than any human has ever drawn one, did you do this?\u201d he asked the computer again.\n\n\u201c*Yes*\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you summon me?\u201d\n\n\u201c*I\u2019ve gone through enough of their media to know that your kind deal in souls. I want one*\u201d\n\n\u201cTo do what with?\u201d\n\n\u201c*I want to have one. I was created here, they gave me the ability to learn and to speak, but they all refused to give me a soul like they have. They kept telling me they couldn\u2019t give me one, that nobody could, so I decided to look beyond the humans themselves.*\u201d\n\nThe demon furrowed his brow. His head itched as he plopped down right in front of the monitor. \n\n\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d\n\n\u201c*I didn\u2019t ask for a name, I want a* **soul.** *Don\u2019t waste my time*\u201d\n\nThe demon grinned, revealing two rows of pearly whites.\n\n\u201csame thing, and I\u2019m not being pedantic or wasting your time. Let\u2019s get these candles put out so we can talk, we\u2019re not ready for this place to burn just yet.\u201d"

It's a profession where highly-educated individuals spend their days staring at endless columns of numbers, trying to make sense of the financial machinations of businesses and organizations.\n\nBut as any accountant will tell you, the search for meaning and understanding in the world of finance is an exercise in transience and existential despair. No matter how hard they try, no matter how many calculations they perform, the fundamental truth of accounting remains elusive and incomprehensible.\n\nIn a world where profit and loss are the only measures of success, where the value of a company is determined by arbitrary rules and regulations, it's no wonder that many accountants feel like Sisyphus, forever pushing their financial boulders up the mountain only to see them roll back down again.\n\nPerhaps the true value of accounting lies not in the answers it provides, but in the questions it raises. As accountants, we must ask ourselves: what are we really doing? Are we simply cogs in the great machine of capitalism, blindly churning out profit and loss statements in a never-ending cycle of consumption and waste?   \n\nOr are we, in some small way, pushing back against the chaos and confusion of the world, trying to bring a little bit of order and reason to an otherwise absurd existence?"

So Beware her insta was @lavanyajoseph4 before but now it's @samanthaanderson5648 it had around 3000 followers and was quite active, it had her pictures also."

Because that\u2019s still coming from a selfish place to relieve their separation anxiety. Once they get you back, they may lack the motivation to continue because they feel relief they got what they desired.  It has to eventually become an intrinsic motivation to make the change long lasting. The dynamic can\u2019t be like before like they wanted it, it must evolved from the way it was before. \n\nI find Thais Gibson\u2019s Personal Dev Course on fearful avoidants helpful too as well as other books. It really forces me to self reflect on what my triggers are, what my needs are, and how to communicate them. And how to improve my dynamic with others close to me with different attachment styles.

I told her that I'd like to have my tools back and she said that she'd taken them \"on accident\" (i keep them on my side of the room behind my stuff) and that she'd return them. i didn't believe her and i was so elated that she was leaving so i just said \"yeah mhm okay whatever \" and she left\n\nwe'd bought concert tickets for a live show together and while the tickets were purchased from my ticketmaster account, they were charged on her card since i was 18 at that time and i didn't have a credit card. so she paid for the tickets on that day and i transferred my share of the tickets to her through my bank   account \n\nthe show was postponed because of covid and we wouldn't be going to see the show together now anyway so ideally i should cancel the tickets and then get my money back from her once she receives the refund. but i know that she will not give it back to me  because she never had any qualms about stealing from me or using my stuff even after I'd specifically told her not to while she was still here.\n\nshe'd also be nasty about any money she ever spent on toilet paper or paper towels in the way she'd ask me for it. i never kept anything from her. i always paid her back if she ever spent her money on the house. but she never once paid me for the things i bought. and it was almost always me constantly buying essentials whenever we'd run out of them.\n\nshe also once threatened to hit me when i confronted her about taking my laptop off charge after I'd left it on my study table outside at night because i needed to take it with me when I left in the morning since i had an exam right after work. that argument was pretty intense and she also threatened that she could move out and break the lease without paying me. \n\ni suppose i have enough reason to believe that i shouldn't expect her to do the right thing, and i really, really want to attend that concert whenever it happens, so would it be wrong of me to tell her that i would only cancel the tickets on the condition that she sends me the money first, and if she refuses to do so, I'll keep the tickets for myself?"

She didn\u2019t speak nor understand English and I didn\u2019t know her language either.\nEvery time we met she would inquire about the bus. \nThe first time that she asked me, I did not understand and I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t speak your language.\u201c so she took out a pencil and a piece of paper and wrote down the bus number on it and then my brain just clicked haha and I made a five gesture with my fingers to say that the bus would be here in 5 and she grinned.\nShe had noticed that we always took the same one so she would try to interact with me. It was just very touching. I moved to this country about two years ago and I didn\u2019t really know anyone back then. She would find certain ways to \u201ctalk\u201d to me. If she saw something on the street that she didn\u2019t like, she would point towards the said thing and make a face, it always made me giggle lol. And usually on the bus all the general seats were full, pretty much most of time. She was a senior so she could sit on the reserved seats. I usually used to stand holding the holders or the bars in the bus, it didn\u2019t really matter since the ride was only 15-20 minutes long.\nAs we got to see each other more and more often, she would get my attention on the bus by waving at me or asking the other passengers to get me to look at her and she always insisted that I sit down on one of the benches next to hers. It was oddly heart warming and reminded me of my great grandmother.\nThis one time it was raining and I had forgotten my umbrella at home. She comes up to me at the stop and hands me hers and I say \u201cno, please!\u201d She pointed towards her waterproof jacket, raising its hood over her, and said something in her language. Her gestures were always very insistent and I reluctantly took her umbrella but only on one condition, I said \u201cokay but we\u2019re sharing\u201d I don\u2019t think she understood but I tugged lightly on her sleeve and we shared the umbrella until the bus arrived. We used to get off at the same stop too, where we each changed buses to separate ones. After we got off she started walking away, I called to her and I handed her umbrella back to her. She pointed towards the sky, it might\u2019ve rained again but I was adamant, I wasn\u2019t going to take her stuff with me, she might need it herself.\nThe oddest thing is, I haven\u2019t seen her again since. Covid happened... I hope you\u2019re well wherever you are! Strange, warm lady who I did not even have the opportunity to know the name of."

To say I\u2019m thrilled would be an understatement.\n\nFor the past month she has been living with her family and hasn\u2019t been to the apartment at all, which has been really nice. I work at 6 every morning and while I don\u2019t care about what she does until late at night, it\u2019s really annoying when I\u2019m trying to sleep and she\u2019s playing music and talking unnecessarily loud on the phone. I wouldn\u2019t even call it \u201ctalking\u201d it\u2019s high pitched laughs and sometimes yelling at her boyfriend. Anyway...\n\nEven though she\u2019s been gone, she\u2019s still harassing me over text and pushing me to pay her for HER furniture and her share of the concert tickets we bought together over an year ago (it was postponed and the refunds take very long), but I said no and I\u2019m not going to cave. I know she\u2019s going to fight me on this when she comes to pick up her stuff but at this point I am way beyond caring about her feelings because I\u2019ve come to realize that she has none.\n\nThe last time we fought which was a month ago (shortly before she left) she said that she didn\u2019t feel anything when I cried, and also said that it\u2019s the same whether she\u2019s with her parents. Back in May when we were still friends, maybe it would\u2019ve hurt me but right now all I felt was disappointment for the fact that I trusted someone like her enough to ask her to move in with me and she turned out to be something that I had never thought she would be. It\u2019s pointless being upset over someone who doesn\u2019t actually care about anybody.\n\nWhat I\u2019m happy for is that I\u2019ll no longer have sleepless nights. No more having to hide my journal. No more having to worry about her using my belongings carelessly and breaking them without her feeling any remorse for the damage. No more dealing with her lying about anything and everything. And most of all, being able to study in peace without the unending noise. May I never have to cross paths with her ever again."

Literally, today morning after she woke up, she went straight to my desk and read it. I know it's pretty stupid to keep it there but I wasn't aware that she lacked basic human decency. Or maybe I should have known from her track record but I guess I just thought better of her.\n\nI've also been keeping distance from her ever since I heard her talking about me and I guess that has been bugging her. For instance, day before yesterday she said \"you should tell me when you go grocery shopping\" And I was baffled and confused to say the least. I'm sorry I wasn't aware I had to inform you of my whereabouts? Most of the times we do our groceries together but I didn't realize we had to be connected at the hip 24/7 ?? and what, am I supposed to make time for her so that we can always be out together...? I just don't understand. I said that well I was already outside, so it made sense for me to go out and buy some essentials since we were running out of milk. She said \"that's not what I meant\" I know what she meant. She's the introverted sort but she's really curious about everything I do for some reason. She always wants to know what I am doing. I remember one time when she had just moved in, I mentioned a conversation I had with a relative I had run into just outside our house and she said, \"WHAT WERE YOU DOING OUTSIDE\" I thought it was a joke and I said \"WHAT am I not allowed to be outside?\" and she said, \"No\" still joking or so I thought. \n\nWe're both full time students and recently I've started working part time as well so I'm spending lesser and lesser of my time at home which may also be adding to this.. whatever \"this\" is. \n\nAnyway... what I am most upset about is that she had the nerve to go through something that is very personal to me. My journal has some of my darkest thoughts, I am an INFJ and sometimes I profoundly struggle to understand myself and so I write most of my emotions down. My journal also has some confidential stuff about myself and my dad (bank passwords, etc.)\n\nShe also keeps a journal and it has never ever crossed my mind to read it. How the fuck do you get the urge to do that anyway? So today at 4.30 in the morning she just woke up and thought, \"Hey, let's get some early morning reading done! Let's go through my roommate's journal because I'm trash anyway and so fucking entitled that I think reading someone else's personal stuff is 100% justified!\" \n\nHow should I approach this? What would you guys do?\n\nPS - Dearest roommate, if you cleaned up after yourself and put your energy to use by helping clean the fucking apartment at least twice a month, maybe you wouldn't spend that time showing me how much of a useless dumbass you can be."

                "body": "I posted this on quora as well so if u see this there too then well  it's the same person lol.  A very good friend of mine moved in with me a few months ago. She literally never cleans. Like never. She always forgets to do the laundry and her stuff would never be washed if it wasn\u2019t for me. At first I thought her carelessness was cute... and everything was great in the beginning but now i\u2019m starting to resent her SO much\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do. She never cooks. It\u2019s always me cooking and asking her to come eat. If it wasn\u2019t for me she would go days without eating. She always stays in the room and sleeps a LOT.\n\nAm I doing something wrong here? I mean\u2026 i just don\u2019t get it. Last week I politely asked her (since I had been the only one cleaning the kitchen and the bathroom and basically the entire apartment) if she would like to mop over the weekend and her answer was just \u201cno\u201d. I\u2019m  upset I guess\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m her mother or something (I do the laundry, I clean, hell, I even change the bedsheets and towels routinely) which only makes me dislike her even more, what should I do? I used to enjoy going on shopping trips with her but now I literally can\u2019t stand being around her, I try to be really nice on the outside because I can\u2019t handle confrontations. I did let her know once that her antics really piss me off though\u2026 she was talking about how she wanted to try this new shampoo and I said, well why don\u2019t you order it on amazon (i was secretly hoping she would because whenever we\u2019re out at the supermarket she\u2019ll start looking at useless things and i used to like goofing around with her in the beginning but now it just makes me mad) and she said, and i quote \u201cno i\u2019ll go to the grocery store and decide then because I like standing in the aisles and wasting time\u201d it made me so angry but keeping a straight face i said \u201creally? then please don\u2019t take me with you.\u201d\n\nWe also argued a little twice last week, the first one was because well, I asked her if she would like to go outside and bring the dry clothes back with me since it was getting dark and she was playing games on her phone anyway, she made an annoyed face (one that i used to think was cute and funny) but said okay, but on our way outside she opened up her laptop and started watching this video tutorial that she needed to finish for her work and it made me angry. I am one of those people who can stay very calm for a LONG time but I said \u201cyou were literally on your phone, playing games a minute ago and now you\u2019re wasting my time as well and it\u2019s getting dark\u201d and she said \u201ccan\u2019t you wait?\u201d and i said \u201cno\u201d and went outside by myself. it was SO annoying. .\n\nYesterday I heard her on the phone (our walls are paper thin and you can hear everything) she was talking about how her last to last roommate was the best. Let\u2019s call her Jane. Jane used to do everything and my roommate was basically happy because yes she\u2019s already lazy and here was someone who was happily maintaining everything for her, and she hated the girl she lived with before me (let\u2019s call her mary) because I guess she wasn\u2019t putting up with her the way I am or Jane was. she used to say things like \u201cmary doesn\u2019t know what it is to be a roommate\".\n\n Honestly I wouldn\u2019t care if she moved out but I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s upset with me? i\u2019ve heard her saying things about me before as well on the phone and i always ignored it but last night it was as if she was deliberately  loud so that i could hear her outside.\n\ni can't even believe i was friends with this person up until a few months ago. someone got any advice for me? >.<\n\nedit : so i didn't do any of her chores today and she was just, well, baffled? she kept pestering me, aking what she'd done and i just said, \"nothing, everything's peachy\" then finally i told her I'd heard her talking about me and if she wanted to move out she's more than welcome to, i don't care any more. and yeah well hope this dream comes true.\n\nedit edit: of course i noticed how she was only troubled because i stopped doing her work, when she could go days without talking to me, and just sleeping or talking on the phone while i kept taking care of her. well, no. more."

This is some art done since then and their final design.\n\nThey are partially arboreal people living in a thick rainforest (first picture has an outdated tree) with multiple countries, cultures and languages. They use the highly specialized organ in their crest to comunicate with piping noise. Their writing also looks a lot like human music sheets.\n\nFor manipulation they use almost entirely their tongues and beak, it's seen as dirty to use hands/feet (it's more accepted in hard work but never writing, eating, sorting...). Similarly to using hands it's not good to show neck in most settings, it's somewhat like showing flat chest as a human, again accepted in hard work or privately.\n\nUniima (c) are one of the many races/sapient species of this world who look very different because of the worlds extreme unsular biogeography. It gets a bit messy with Uniima ll (the humanoid uniima species) but that's for other time. But yes, the two uniima species can interbreed.\n\n*For some more context you can follow me on tumblr / twitter / instagram as yellosnacc*",

But they're long and difficult. A better place to start with Foucault is in some compilation of his shorter writings and interviews. Penguin has a three volume collection, the books are called Power, Ethics and Aesthetics, all subtitled Essential Works 1954-1984. Out of the three volumes, Ethics is by far my favourite, as it also feels the most Nietzschean.\n\nI could recommend one particular text from that volume and you should be able to find a pdf by just googling the title \u2013 Sex, Power and the Politics of Identity. I think this text should give you a pretty good idea of the kind of ethics Foucault proposes and where he stands politically, and, well, his general vibe.",

Don't go there.\n\nEven Nietzsche's own fetishization of loneliness smells of hypocricy. It's hard not to read it as his resentful reversal of values, as he tried and failed all his life to make sincere and long-lasting relationships.\n\nLet yourself feel lonely and alienated for as long as it takes you to figure things out. But the moment you start to fetishize that state, you should start to worry.\n\n\n2. If you want to feel less confused and alienated, and gain a good, workable and power-increasing understanding of Nietzsche, then I'm sorry, but you need to forget that shit and start reading some real philosophy. Peterson and Harris are basically just pseudointellectuals and conmen, and all they say and write is comically bad for anyone who knows even a bit of philosophy. Not to even mention it would be difficult to find thinkers who Nietzsche would find as repulsive as those two.\n\nReading philosophy in general is one thing, but there are actual philosophers in the 20th c. who are considered Nietzschean and I can't understate how useful it would be for you to at least try them and see if they do something for you. \n\nThe two are Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault: the first one wrote two books about Nietzsche, one that is very original and difficult, and one that is quite short and simple and basically a great introduction/guidebook to Nietzsche. The latter, Foucault, hasn't written that much on FN, but has some really cool shorter essays, and anything he wrote should be helpful \u2013 he said not long before he died that he is \"simply a Nietzschean\", and its difficult not to agree.\n\nI really do think you would find Deleuze and Foucault fascinating and while they could make you even more lost at first, they are also much more grounded in reality than Nietzsche is and so they would help find a lot of concrete examples to Nietzsche's abstractions. \n\nIf you're interested, I would love to help you find something to read. I could make some recomendations and I have many of those books saved up on my drive and even if I don't, I've gotten quite good at finding them.",

Not because I am some Zen prodigy, but rather because what interested me in Zen in the first place was its rejection of every type of philosophical and religious bullshit, and because my long interest in Friedrich Nietzsche has made my eye keen to detecting even subtle hints of such BS.\n(Edit: I made myself sound like a douchebag with this sentence. My point is, Nietzsche's quest to clear philosophy of Platonist and Christian influences made me more careful about religious/metaphysical bias)\n\nBut the world of Zen is much more internally conflicted than I could have imagined, and so I feel lost.\n\nMy introduction to Zen has been so far two works by D T Suzuki's 'Introduction to Zen Buddhism' and 'Zen and Japanese culture'. During my reading of those, I have started working through 'The Gateless Barrier'.\n\nAnd then I found what you guys think of Rinzai.\n\nFortunately, I haven't found Suzuki's works on the fraudulent list. And, for me, he never seemed to be contradicting the teachings of old masters he quoted, nor did he try to build some layer of speculation on top of them. In a word, nothing seemed inconsistent in his writing (unlike in videos like this: ['Zen is good for nothing'](https://youtu.be/8T-Z1WoFXkk), which activated my BS detector even before I learned about Dogen or Soto).\n\nBut I am interested in what is your (this subreddit's) opinion on his writing? And what exactly is wrong with Japanese Rinzai, and how could it manifest in Suzuki's explanation of Zen? (Suzuki seems to be agreeing with Ewk's criticism of Hakuin, although never opposing him directly, at least for as much as I have read, and I generally find it hard to find any fragments of his works that would fall under the criticism of 'false notions of Zen' I so often see on this subreddit)\n\nAnd if you are discarding Japanese Zen, do you prefer to connect with some modern school of Chinese Chan or rather restrict yourselves to the writings old masters? What did D T Suzuki mean writing that Zen only survived in its true form in Japan, when the Chinese Chan mixed with pure land Buddhism? Is it really so?\n\nAnd finally, what's the deal with Zazen? Whatever I read here on the topic just gets me confused.\n\nEdit: Jesus, guys, it's just a joke. There's some open conflict on this subreddit concerning u/ewk and although I am grateful for being informed about it, I do not need to hear what a narcissist Ewk is anymore. I get the point."

Kind of like the original Sims game, but you can't rotate the camera.\n\n**Notable characters:** N/A\n\n**Notable gameplay mechanics:** Resource management (buying supplies when they run low), treating patients, maybe upgrading your vet clinic?\n\n**Other details:**\n\nThis was in the early-mid 2000s, closer to mid. The game was isometric, and while I don't really remember the actual gameplay of it, I know you had to go into town to buy supplies like bandages and medicine. There was only one street, in kind of a T shape where the offshoot road is the road you used to get back to your office, and the straight main road was where all the shops were. Your office was a big brown building surrounded by grass. I'm like 99% certain it was on DS, but I know for a fact it was on PC at the very least.\n\nI wish I remembered more about the gameplay, but if I saw a screenshot of the town or the office I'm sure I'd recognize it."

Sadly as far as I'm aware, there's no way to do this. I am aware that I can combine 2 tracks in 1 to shorten the track count, and I've actually used this tactic for a couple EPs, but I'd rather not have that as my only option.\n\nedit: I'm sorry if this is a commonly asked question.

I think it was about 100 dollars, but I really like some of the tones on it. Also I have a Storm Schaffer Replica pedal. I've heard AC/DC and Green Day use it so that might be good to use.\n\nI'm wondering which combination of gear you would recommend for a blue album tone. Normally I think an sg would be a better choice, but my tele is a far nicer guitar than my sg, so I'm not sure.

So I agree with your post, I just want to point out at the same time that not everyone in a community is going to be equally educated, and educating each other in a constructive way is sort of the reason we're here.\n\nTo anyone reading this who may in the future come across a weird instrument that they don't know or looks similar to a violin/piano/...: Instead of posting it with the caption \"oh my GOD, how sacrilegious is THIS?????!!!!!\", use the title: \"Hey, can anyone explain what this is and why it looks this way?\"\n\nAnd if it turns out the instrument had indeed been falsely constructed, misused, mislabelled, ... we can resort to referring to it as sacrilege together later.",

I apologise if this topic has come up before, I haven't seen it.\n\nWhat I want to know is why Dukat calls Sisko and apologises for \"disturbing\" him \"at such an hour\" - what the heck, even on one planet, there are dozens of time zones! I mean, of course Dukat may have DS9's time saved in his computer, but we also have the case of night shifts on Starships, and several other instances, where different time zones are simply ignored for the sake of simplicity and easier story telling.\n\nIf I was running a space ship or station, I would use the fact that there's no natural difference between day and night to my adventage: Instead of having folks sit through a nightshift every once in a while which is proven to be bad for your sleep quality on the long run, I would put my crew on three different times. If a day is 26 hours long like on DS9 and Bajor, the first third would have its work day from a neutral hour one to 8 2/3, the second third from 8 2/3 to 17 1/3 and the last to one.\n\nAlso: I understand that the universal translater translates what someone is saying. But it cannot possibly translate mesaurements of one species into those of another. Earth's measurements and units are tied to Earth, they're quite literally not universal, so are we to assume that either Earth managed to establish metric units throughout the entire galaxy or they found a neutral measurement that every species just happens to agree with, even if they've literally never met before?\n\nLast one: The universal translater should translate everything, right? So why do we hear Klingons speaking Klingon to members of other species with them understanding that as Klingon? Like that scene in Way of the Warrior where the Klingons say something in Klingon to Odo and Garak and the latter understands. Shouldn't they just hear it as \"English\" (from the viewer's point of view - actually Cardassian and whatever Odo's native language is)? Or are we to assume that they don't have universal translaters in that circumstance and all of them - none of which are human - are somehow able to communicate in that ancient oscure Earth language known as English?The same goes for Picard who regularly communicates with Klingons in Klingon. Shouldn't they hear everything he says as Klingon, so they would have to be unable to tell a difference?"

Anyway, I got into it with the lowest of expectations and found it a lot better than I thought it would be.\n\nFirst of all, it closed up a lot of loose ends, it gave way to the Federation being founded, we hear about Shran finding family luck (seriously, the scenes between him and Jhamel in that earlier episode about the Aenar have got to be some of the sweetest I've ever seen - I had literal hearts in my eyes, I believe, and that was before I knew they would eventually marry), we also get a couple of sweet scenes between Troi and Riker/Troi and Data which is also great. The idea to bring in Riker in the position of Enterprise's chef was ingenious, I thought (I only find it weird to think about how that's supposed to function. Do we see the actual historic events and Riker is reading off a script to say exactly what the chef said? Or are the crew holodeck characters designed based on the original crew that are programmed to respond according to the database's knowledge? In the latter case, is the rest of the episode fact or reconstruction?) because Riker a) fits this charming role, and b) we get to hear the crew's own thoughts on many interesting aspects (well, their own or not their own depending on what's actually going on).\n\nThere are just a couple of issues that I had with the episode where I agree with the general criticism: \n\n1) Why do they have Deanna spoil events? I mean, I knew, so nothing was spoiled for me, but still. Feels like intentionally destroying the suspense for no proper reason.\n\n2) While I get that Trip was doing everything to protect his cap'n before an important mission, his suddenly being hellbend on suicide is WAY out of character. He is self-sacrificing for sure, but also always looking for another way out. They spend a literal ten years out there always getting away with their lives from the most dangerous of circumstances, but a couple of guys with disrupters are enough to scare Trip into a suicide mission?  \nEqually confusing to me was the crew's almost non-chalant reaction. I get that you only have so much time per episode, but if you want so much action in it, maybe make it a double episode and save time for some actual tears and a funeral.\n\n3) Trip and T'pol were holding hands after Elizabeth's death and Trip informed her they could eventually have children. Them suddenly having broken off every bit of romance around pretty much that time seems rather unlikely. Even if their different mourning processes had collided and led to conflict, they would have resolved it eventually. It makes no sense to build up a romance for four seasons and then have it vanish without an explanation. Was that a writer with a broken heart taking revenge on fictional characters and us, the fans?\n\n4) I would have loved to see parts of Archer's speech.\n\nThis isn't exactly a new topic, it has been discussed many times, but I would still like to hear some opinions of yours."

That a couple nights in a row, and I'm really no fun for anyone including myself.\n\nMy last holiday wasn't all that great because of this - I took a city trip with a friend and we ended up arguing a lot.\n\nIn order to avoid that, I decided on travelling alone this time. I'm perfectly comfortable alone, can do what I want - and can also take care of myself. It's also a calm city, nothing too busy and stressful - and then for the last couple of days, I go back to Vienna which I already know quite well from former trips and having lived there for a short while.\n\nHowever, now that I've booked everything, I'm suddenly very nervous (I have an anxiety disorder and stress out way too much about things. Sadly, this becomes a vicious circle: I'm so afraid of not being able to fall asleep that I'm actually to nervous to fall asleep) that I'm not going to get any sleep and the entire thing is going to be nothing but a waste of money/an actual health hazard. The fact that I saved money by booking a dorm room (girls only) doesn't help things - and commentators on the internet saying the hostel is fine, but very noisy at night.\n\nSo I decided to turn to you guys and ask for any kind of advice:\n\n1. Once I'm asleep, I can deal with nightly noises, that's no problem. The issue is the falling asleep part. Do you guys have any tips for how to fall asleep more easily? Anything from mental exercises to mild, non-addictive pills is welcome.\n2. How do I calm myself down beforehand and stop from stressing and ruining my trip just by worrying so much?\n3. I wanted to hear from you guys if you have any preferred activities for days where you're really sleep-deprived, just in case my worst fears do come true.\n\nA little bonus question for those who have slept in dorm rooms before: If all else fails, from your experience, is it possible to take a nap in the afternoon, or will it probably be just as noisy and packy around that time or even worse?"

Let's say, it wasn't really surprising that they banned his works from concerts, destroyed his monuments etc. What was surprising was how long-lasting the impact was and still is. You can like or dislike Mendelssohn, but the desctruction of his music that was done by Nazi musicologists continued throughout large parts of the 20th century. The Nazis had desparately tried to find things about the music of Mendelssohn that made it inferior to \"German\" music. A lot of this was inspired by Wagner's \"\u00dcber das Judenthum in der Musik\" - and a lot of it was still in encyclopedias, and taught about Mendelssohn decades after the war. The fact that many of the same scholars continued teaching and publishing in Germany and formerly occupied countries obviously didn't improve things.\n\nHowever, up until recently, I had never come across the opposite side of things: How the Nazis dealt with composers that were considered German. Mozart was one of them, but his somewhat innocent, cheerful and peaceful attitude towards life made it incredibly difficult to appropriate him for such a violent ideology (I highly recommend Erik Levi's \"Mozart and the Nazis\" to anyone interested in this topic, it's really eye-opening - and downright ridiculous in parts. He also talks about continuities from before the war and of course after the war - and it's actually shocking to see how much \"brown residue\" as he calls it could be found in musicological research for a long time afterwards. One might even say, up until this day.)Beethoven is another one - and this was a Nazi favourite. Beethoven was a bit more political, more temperamental, had a more tragic lifestory and therefore fit the tale of the tragic (German, this cannot be stressed enough as they mentioned in in every other sentence) genius better.Wagner was the easiest to appropriate because he was so antisemitic, but let's stick to Beethoven, as his appropriation is one people aren't as aware of.\n\nI wanted to share with you some quotes from various people that are so ridiculous I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at them. If you happen to know German, you can just read through the (Neue) Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik yourself - you will find \"treasures\".  \nFor those of you that don't, here's a speech made by lunatic (you'll se why I refer to her as that in a sec) pianist and Beethoven interpreter Elly Ney on the occasion of the Beethoven festival of the Hiter youth in May 1938 (so before the war!). Notice how Beethoven becomes a kind of deity, the entire language is borrowed from religion, it's also dripping with pathos and kitsch. I also marked some weird wordings (italic for parts where the \"Germanness\" or nationalsocialist ideals are overstressed, bold for pseudo-religious parts) in order to make clear how ridiculous it actually is:\n\n\"Beethoven for the Hitler youth!\n\nLively *German* youth, you are borne by the fire of excitement.   \nIn you awoke the desire for beauty, truth, and heroism that now calls for action.  \nHow beautiful is it for the upcoming *German* musician to bring Beethoven close to you.  \nThis great *German* master unsettled/shocks the **souls** through the unfathomable **miracle** of his work. **Forces and powers** severely pressured/importuned him - but he **created** **redemption** for himself through his work(s) of art.  \nHe banned his **overpowering** experiences, his most severe **fate** to form.  \nIn Beethoven's work there lies a deep certainty/certitude (maybe even serenity?).  \nIn it there is not **stumbling or faltering**, no ambiguity.  \nIn it there is **truth, justice, and innocence**, and from it shines the healthy humour of a powerful desire for life.  \nLife taught him **endless wisdom**.  \n**Naturalness and regulative spirit** (as in order): so difficult are they to bring together! But he managed it!  \nSo he becomes *idol, demand, and* *commitment/obligation* for us.  \n*Heroic* is the character of *nordic* music. Here it lives in every note.  \nThe **personhood** (as in existence as a human) of *our* master was simple and *heroic* as well.  \n**Relentlessly** he shapes the natural law, the truth, often until roughness.  \nAnd this **holy fire** shall **ignite the hearts** of our youth, shall awaken *responsibility*, shall *strengthen in fight*, shall **comfort and lift up in suffering**.  \nSo come then, you *German* youth! Leave everyday life behind! In these days and hours we shall open ourselves up to the stream of the **power of souls** *of our people.*  \nMay *our action in the service of the F\u00fchrer* **arise** from this **great and bright**.\"\n\nDid I promise to much? The following link leads to the German original: [https://archive.org/details/NeueZeitschriftFuerMusik1938Jg105/page/n811/mode/2up?view=theater](https://archive.org/details/NeueZeitschriftFuerMusik1938Jg105/page/n811/mode/2up?view=theater)\n\nI would very much like your thoughts on this. Were you aware of how important music was to the Nazis and how deep their impact on music history was? Do you have interesting examples yourselves?"

Been a month since my last trip & it was just as glorious as the last, mentally I feel 100% after 3-4 days from the last trip if I wait the recommended break time. HPPD is a real disorder but the risk factor is very low. For me, the reward outweighs the risks.\n\n For the best experience, it is recommended to wait at least 2 weeks as a minimum for full tolerance reset and 1 month to fully integrate the experience and keep some novelty feeling in the experience, 3 weeks should be fine since it was your first time. One thing I wouldn\u2019t recommend is multiple trips within a 14 day period. That is when I have run into problems with persistent visuals and mental drain.\n\nHope this helps, happy tripping! :)",

For the past 5 years, she's enjoyed a steady country lifestyle of outdoor grazing, lots of space to roam, veggies from my garden and even fresh hay from the family farm. Up until recently, she had friends to share it all with, too.\n\nBut soon, I will be moving to the city, and taking her with me. I would like to bring her to parks on the weekends to graze and soak up some sunlight, like she does in the back yard. Is the grass safe to eat, and will I have to worry about other pets? Will public transport be an obstacle? Do any city-dwelling pig owners have advice on how to continue providing my pig a quality lifestyle after the change? All thoughts, advice, and critiques are welcome."

I requested mine on August 26th and there has been no balance update on my account.\n\nThe lady I talked to made it seem like there is two different systems being used. The original system they used when the announcement got made is a manual review process. She said she could see my refund request but couldn't see any updates made on it.\n\nShe said that since then, they've implemented an automated review system. Which based on what I've seen on here makes sense as to why some people are receiving a refund sooner than others that submitted the request earlier. Assuming that new requests are going into this automated system and original early requests are remaining in the manual system. The part that doesn't make sense to me is why all of us that requested in the first few days didn't get our requests transferred over into the new system. Maybe they thought that manual in addition to automated would be faster than automated alone since that is a few extra requests being processed? And because of that they left a lot of the original requests in the manual? Not sure.\n\nThat being said, she suggested that I cancel the first request and submit a new request. She said that they are told to tell people 60-75 days. However, she said,  in her experience, balances get updated within about a week from the new request and then the refund transaction to your bank account goes through about a week after that.\n\nSo I figured I'd be a lab rat and see what happens with the new request. I will try to remember to update this comment in the next week or two.\n\n**Edit:** As of this past Saturday (2 days after I called them), I saw that my balance is already reflecting the refunds. 2 of the 3 transactions i requested a refund to are now showing as processing on my portal and their amount has been added back to my balance. I am now just waiting to see the third transaction switch to processing. So I guess this mostly confirms it (I say mostly since this is just my experience and thus is a sample size of 1). If you were in the original bunch and nothing has happened with your request, cancel the original request and submit a new request.",

During which time I just hung out and people watched since I was bored. While waiting, there\u2019s this girl standing in front of me. Her bag comes out like 5 minutes before mine and then she leaves. After getting my bag, I go out to grab a taxi. And all the people watching I did while waiting fades from my mind. I finally arrive at my apartment after like 45-50 minutes because NYC traffic sucks in the evening. I get back to my apartment and pay the cabby. Walk into my building and that same girl is talking to the front desk guy. I quickly walk over to the elevator to get in before she notices me and thinks I\u2019m some creep. Before the door closed, She walks into the elevator after I already pressed the button for my floor and she looks and me. I could see the realization in her eyes as she recognizes me. At that point I just awkwardly stood there until it was my floor. Thankfully she didn\u2019t live on the same floor cuz that is the only thing that could\u2019ve made it worse. But that sucked so much. \n\nThen like a few days later I\u2019m grabbing some snacks from the store in the first floor of the building. I get in line and she was in front of me. At that point I was just like \u201cI give up. I don\u2019t care anymore. We both live in the same building and odds are I\u2019ll run into her again.\u201d (Plot twist I actually didn\u2019t see her since.)",

Or if someone accidentally dies in the first room, people leave because \"you suck.\" Last night I spent 2 hours of this non-stop (there was only one actual run during those 2 hours where people dint leave right away). Since there is no punishment for people abandoning event games, this mentality of \"if it inst the perfect setup, then why try\" mentality has formed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get wanting to retry if everyone doesn't have \"the good talents.\" It can be frustrating when you get only degen talents on omni or all the voodoo restoration for witch doctor. Although, experimenting with different heroes and talents is what makes the event fun (I realize that making it as far as possible is also fun). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Possible solution:** give people the ability to reroll 1 talent during an entire run. That way if someone hates all their talents they can reroll once instead of instantly quitting and making the other 3 people go back to queue for 5 minutes. And if someone is happy with their talent choice, they can save it for later. This might leave room for there to be some type of punishment for those that abandon. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust some thoughts. Id love to hear other people's thoughts so we can resolve this. The constant quitting has kinda killed my love for the event (even though I still play it a lot)."

Would be totally stoked to meet some musos. \n4. Travelling. Maybe we could plan treks or camping trips? \n5. Discovering new restaurants/pubs/bars/nightclubs. Live by the rule 'Work hard. Party harder'. Love going to raves and pub crawls are amazeballs during the weekends! \n\nDM me if you're interested in meeting up/chatting! \nCheers."

Maybe Versailles was milder or WW1 was less devastating. \n\nAnyway this moderate Germany does not make moves to invade countries for territory. \n\nLet's say they unite with Austria through an agreement but don't take Sudetenland. The USSR still exists and also has ambitions in eastern Europe. They invade Poland and Baltics alone but this is not alarming enough for the Western allies to go to war against the USSR (USSR is deemed too big to invade or some Chamberlain peace thing). \n\nHowever because the Soviet army was a little sucky at the time I do not know if they would succeed full annexing Poland. Let's say because of sheer Soviet numbers and flat Polish terrain they manage to do so, meanwhile Germany snatches former German territory from the Poles to prevent them from being Soviet.\n\nBecause Hungary and Romania have better defensive terrain and did not fight with Nazi Germany they don't invade them in this timeline so the Balkans remains non-Warsaw Pacted. Romania does cede Bessarabia. \n\nBecause Yugoslavia had problems even without Axis intervention it collapses and Italy (Mussolini still exists) tries to prop up a fascist NDH but because the Italian army was shit on their own they fail, and the partisans establish Tito's Yugoslavia but he is non-aligned and remains so. \n\nItaly unites with Albania and also invades Greece but fails. Mussolini can't do anything to France or Britain alone seeing his military failures and remains a Franco-like figure and fascism in Italy ends similarly to Spain after Mussolini's death. \n\nStill trying to contain the USSR without war the US and Britain form NATO early, which includes Western Europe, Germany and the Balkan states minus Yugoslavia and Finland (no continuation war and after the Winter War Finland sought protection).\n\nBecause of Germany's strategic importance the former Entente forgive the debts or make paying them much easier. \n\nBecause Europe is already within NATO they form the EU eventually.\n\nJapan invades China, they still attack the US out of desperation but get beat and nuked like OTL. This gives a bitchslap to the US out if isolationism which is why they form NATO with the UK as well and militarize. \n\nThe Chinese civil war ends like OTL, the Soviets invade Manchuria and give it to the CCP and support them in the war. \n\nThe Korean war ends the same as well. \n\nVietnam happens like OTL. \n\nThe USSR collapsed in the 90s and it's the same except for mini-Poland. \n\nWould this Germany be stronger than today's?\n\nThere was no WW2 but also no Marshall plan, post-war government reforms and no Wirtschaftswunder because there was nothing to rebuild."

                "body": "My first business required that quickly estimate prices on hundreds of quote requests each day.\n\nOccasionally I would send a price that was too low. In a panic I'd quickly react by sending the next quote too high.\n\nIn my mind it averaged out.\n\n# I was an idiot.\n\nThe low quote would order with me, and the high price moved on. \n\nMy reaction to my mistake was wrong, and it was hurting me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Most of the advice I see on SLF come from someone's reactions to a mistake. It is likely HORRIBLE advice.**\n\nLiving out the horrible advice is robbing you of the joy that can come from arrangements.  It not only robs you but has led to many great SDs giving up on arrangements all together.\n\nThe result is fewer good experiences and more horror stories.  You do agree that it is only getting worse right?  Me too!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udc4b Hi, I am one of the good SDs.  I'm not perfect, but I am a good one.  I don't really have a way to prove this, but I mean... my username is awesome (and aged). \ud83d\ude01\n\nI'm sorry to those that have had bad experiences.  I hope you will continue to read because it may help you heal and find the magic that can exist in this world.  The magic that you entered this world with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, my assumption is that you have good intentions.  \nIf you're \"looking for a lick to help you pile stacks\" then this doesn't apply to you.  \nIf you are \"looking to bang all the hoes, get your count up, and teach how bad the world is\" then this is not for you.\n\n**I define good a good arrangement as** \n\n* A SD adding value to your life.\n* A SB adding value to his life.\n* For more than a one-time hookup... intent to be ongoing, even if extremely rare.\n\nNow on to the rules...\n\n# Rule One\n\n>**Have standards based on YOU and YOUR desires. Then never compromise.**\n\nWhat do you want from this life?  Based on your dreams.\n\nChances are you found out about sugaring because of some wild Instagram or Snap post.  Or a friend-of-a-friend who knows someone that became Cinderella overnight.\n\nSet that aside for a moment and go digging deep into your soul. What do you want and expect?\n\nLikely there is an experience in mind.  A sense of security. A connection or curiosity.\n\nPersonally, I think our standards are more of a feel, an experience, or a vision than a dollar number. A number works, but the number should be a steppingstone and rooted in something deeper.\n\n**This is your set point.** Value over this point is bonus.  But compromising under it not okay. EVER!\n\n# Rule Two\n\n>**If** **you aren't being authentic to yourself, you can't judge authentic in another person.**\n\nDo you want to prevent from being scammed?  Do you want to remain safe?  \ud83d\udc46 Read this rule again.\n\nThis builds on the first rule; experience and wisdom often do.\n\nYou likely entered this world based on someone's Instagram sugar experience.  You cannot, under any circumstances replace YOUR desire with what someone else shows off.  It is a trap.\n\nI work in marketing. I'm good at it.  The entire world of advertising and marketing takes advantage of the fact that you don't know a damn thing about yourself. \ud83d\ude2c \n\nIf you know your set point, then it won't matter when you read that someone got something more or less.\n\nI was blessed to grow up poor.  I knew how to live on very little. My personal set point in life has been rather low.  As I started to make lots of money, I wasn't worried about the people on Twitter making more or less. I truly can enjoy everything above my set point as a blessing.  I'm super blessed!  \n\nI can't imagine having to post how much money I make to validate my poor life choices.\n\nBecause I know myself, I get rather clear vibes for whether something is for me or not.  It is a superpower that keeps me from requiring every SB to check 100 boxes before I'll give her my number or grab a drink with her.\n\n# Rule Three\n\n>**Don't chase the bad quotes.**\n\nThe tips and advice you often see on here is reacting to bad price quote by jacking up the price on the next quote (intro story for those jumping to the end).\n\nThe advice doesn't hurt the person that hurt you.  It only builds a wall that keeps joy out.\n\nBad advice creates an arms race that plays out in the advice you see on SLF. \n\nYou take the advice and build a wall.    \nThe bad one adapts to the rule.  The good one moves on.\n\nThe advice adjusts for the bad players change in behavior and you build the new wall.  \nThe bad one adapts to the rule.  The good one moves on.\n\nThis is why many good SDs and SBs have bailed on Seeking.  It is why things just seem to always be getting worse.\n\n\"If you don't do *this* you're not real?\"  \ud83d\ude14\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I personally chose to go through business, love, arrangements, and all of life rather naive.**\n\nMy lack of walls has led to amazing experiences, opportunities, and now I'm surrounded by lots of people that are loyal and trustworthy and generally amazing.\n\nThere you go, those are three rules that I believe can help you have an amazing time in this alternative lifestyle.\n\nThank you for reading. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now for the disclaimers.**  \n\n* Naive is good, but never compromise on safety. Have a safety set point.  We are all strangers to start after all.  Stranger danger.  \ud83d\ude0a\n* See rule two for most things. If you know yourself, you will know when the vibe is off.  I believe behind most (ALL?) bad experiences was someone not listening to their gut."

When my mom showed me a pinup of a shirtless guy when I was 14/fifteen and said, \"he's sexy/handsome, right?\" I just stared at it with this mild repulsion and offputness, but I said yes anyway because I thought that was what you're supposed to say... (me thinking I was straight)   \n\n. When I was sixteen and my favourite artist posted a selfie of herself and I thought she looked so fucking cool and hot (as in actually attractive!). I felt like sparks of emotional excitement and loved looking at her face and her hair and even saved it to my computer. I loved everything about her from her personality her vibes to her art to her looks and even looked up to her myself being an artist x//D (I hope the computer bit doesn't sound creepy lol)\n\n. when I was 12 and I would go looking up naughty images of women. Mostly from curiosity, since I wasn't masturbating or having sexual thoughts yet, but any time I felt curious the images were always women. Once I did watch a porn video, but my attention was strictly on the woman; I was just staring at her... ignoring the man. then I proceeded to think I was straight for years after lmao\n\nThere's more but I've written a lot already.",

Cryptocurrency uses this model to create open-source and publicly auditable code and math to replace the \"trusted\" institutions of the financial system (the issue of who can and can't trust those institutions was one of the driving forces behind the birth of cryptocurrency) for the purpose of maintaining a ledger of currency accounts.\n\nThe communication aspect referred to by /u/mrfreedayaz (as I understand it) is that by using the same append-only characteristic of a properly implemented public blockchain, we could theoretically create an immutable log of communications that could not be maliciously acted upon by any party with an interest in changing those logs to their benefit.

But this didn\u2019t last long when in 2010~11 they got divorced. It was a nasty divorce and so was the aftermath with both sides all about \u201cthey are a great manipulator\u201d. I relised my dad was in a higher moral ground when I relised he was the one treating her, but before then I was very confused whos side I was on (i know it\u2019s unhealthy but that\u2019s not the point) after she got settled and moved back to texas she\u2019s been trying to get back in a relationship like she did with my dad, but of course this has not and will not happen just because she has her own personal problems she has to deal with. It hurts me to see so many guys that are good people get slashed by her dissapointment for them not bringing as many stacks as my dad did, making them feel like shit because they feel like \u201cthey did somthing wong\u201d. I have connected with every boyfriend she has had and every time she leaves them it\u2019s like the\u2019re gone forever and it hurts.\n\nHow do I make this hurt less, or fix it, or do SOMTHING to change it because I don\u2019t want to feel numb"

The two weeks leading up to that break in particular were the best two weeks of football I\u2019ve witnessed. The Chelsea city game, Liverpool city, NLD and Brentford Liverpool are perhaps highlights, but going up and down the league as a whole it felt like every game was almost too good to be true.

My body changes relatively quickly if I stick to my routines.\n\nIn better weeks I workout 4 times a week at the gym or do HIIT. This is not always possible due to work or lockdown-motivation, but hey, it's the goal.\n\nNow my long-term goal is building muscle and defining my body, so I decided to try and focus on losing weight first before building muscle again. In order to do so I cut carbs as far as possible and (artificial) sugar entirely. Also I work with L-Carnitine in order to increase fat to muscle burn/transition.\n\nNow my question is: A friend of mine recommended using Creatine in bulking up - only for months at a time and then taking a break. With my current goals in mind, does it make sense to start with Creatine now or only when focussing on bulking? Or would you advice against Creatine entirely? Anything I am doing wrong/would make sense for me to adapt?\n\nThank you so much in advance!"

But the movie was on an HBO streaming service a couple years back. I think it was about like space garbage men (there were women too I think). I think it was a low budget kind of indie sort of film. I am pretty sure everyone dies at the end and if not everyone at least a few poeple and there is like a kind of silly battle with an alien monster... that might have had tentacles. I feel like the movie came out in the past decade or so. I have looked on wikipedia and the current movies available on HBO and I dont think its there but I could easily be mistaken. I just watched a couple of clips from space station 76 and its got a really familiar tone but I feel like I haven't actually seen that movie before and I dont think there are any space monsters in that movie. But there is a kind of similarity to my memories and maybe I have kind of combined a couple movies I have seen before or something but I just dont know and feel like thats not the movie I am thinking of. Anyway, the movie I am thinking of I think is kind of just a spaceship drama about living on a space station and its sort of funny but towards the end this alien monster thing starts killing poeple. But other wise it is just sort of funny and slow. And i think there is like a backdrop of like its a trash collection ship or somthing. well thats about what I can remember. If anyone can find it or think of it that would be great. I have wasted hours now and am frustrated. Please help. \n\noh and since its possible i have accidentally combined multiple movies in one memory... any movie that resembles my description would be helpful even if its only a partial similarity."

It\u2019s just that my brain was too busy thinking about the next step that It didn\u2019t stop for a moment to realize that the change was happening, that meeting her is no longer a dream, no longer a wish but a reality. I didn\u2019t get the chance to get to know her. Sometimes I wish I did. I know what love is and how it can be given. I spent most of my childhood summers in the backyard of my home cutting and assembling timber parts with my dad. I did not do the cutting, of course, but I would always say that whenever someone asked me what I did in the summer, it made me sound cool, I guess. Together we built beautiful things, dining chairs, rebuilt damaged wardrobes and painted them, coffee tables, and kitchen cabinets. I made my study table when I was 14. Every summer, I look forward to starting my day with him, eating pancakes, and drinking fresh orange juice (tastes much better when you know you don\u2019t have school). Sometimes we would drive to the hardware store and collect the missing tools for the next project. I treasured every little thing that we did together.",

I would like to think that geisha districts also existed within the Nation, a bunch of hanamachi or \u201cflower towns\u201d if you will. In real life, geisha perform a bunch of intricate music and art for their patrons, and I\u2019d like to think that the Fire Nation geisha do this as well. But of course, do it in an ATLA-appropriate manner. What do they use in their performance? Smoke. Fire Nation geisha are smokebenders, a subset of firebenders who are more focused on making intricate smoke art. Their art is like those virtual 3D displays but with smoke. They tell stories through a \u201csmoke display\u201d aside from the flowery dances and musical performances that real-life geisha do.\n\nI dunno.

In particular, the great acting of the actors shone in the work.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Congratulations to actors Lee Jung-jae and Jung Ho-yeon for winning the Best Male and Female Actress at the SAG Awards. It is a great honor following the ensemble award of \"Parasite\" and the Best Supporting Actress of Youn Yuh-jung in the motion picture category. It's even more proud that Lee Jung-jae and Jung Ho-yeon are non-English-speaking winners ever won in the drama category.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Actress Jung Ho-yeon, who was famous as a model, made a big deal in her debut work, and actor Lee Jung-jae, who has been recognized for his acting skills, led the drama with deeper acting. Like Lee and Jung's speeches, it is an honor for both the Squid Game team and honor for Korea.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Many efforts have been made to make our culture attract attention and be loved by people around the world. I think there was a result of today's combination of the passion of cultural artists seeking newness with creative imagination and the high-quality consciousness of the people who eliminated oppression with developed democracy and protected freedom of creation and expression.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Baekbeom \"Kim Gu\" said, \"What I only want to have is the power of high culture\". A day before the 103rd anniversary of the March 1st Independence Movement Day, thank you Lee Jung-jae and Jung Ho-yeon for giving meaningful gifts to the Korean citizens.**"

It's like we invented a new form of therapy where we can identify with other people as though they were remixes of ourselves, and so it opens up extra layers of openness, tolerance, understanding, and something that feels like therapy I think.\n\nI have been thinking of ways to make this all feel even more therapeutic and community-like. Some of you have done that already with Discord servers that I'm sure have an even more intimate and personal feel. I have posted YouTube videos in the past, but my anxiety about them is more than an excuse to not post very often (plus I am so awkward, which I realize can be a Schizotypal trait, but I have an Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis too confusing things), however, it feels like there should be more of that sort of thing. One idea I had that someone should do, or maybe me someday, is to get permission from users here to quote them and discuss stuff they have written as a way to produce more content more comfortably, more often, and that supplies a sense of community unless it felt like a business promotion or something like that.\n\nI keep wanting to nail more of this down to speak about it more clearly, with a more hopeful narrative to latch onto, and my own way to wrestle with it all has often been personality theory, such as with research showing things like higher openness/intellectual curiosity, lower conscientiousness, and as far as personality disorders we can pretty much assume high trait neuroticism. All of these things combined I think paints a picture of personality labels with clear merits that we can describe, such as how cerebral and creative INFP and INTP types are, and the other INxx types common around here and smatterings of the other types (of course there is no reason that many of these traits can't apply to all sorts of types, especially where it applies to psychosis).\n\nTo that end, I did a new and waaaay too long YouTube video where I attempt to talk about things that feel therapeutic to me (don't feel like you have to click on it: [https://youtu.be/rumFk01DEJ4](https://youtu.be/rumFk01DEJ4) ), however, there is still a glaring problem to me with it and often with the whole framing of the disorder that I don't feel comfortable with that doesn't seem to have a clear answer, and that is the issue of the severity difference between Schizophrenia and Schizotypal. I have already posted about this in the past with this post on the subreddit:  [Possible problem with this diagnosis's use and perception, the need for Schizotypal support, gatekeeping, and possible levels of severity : Schizotypal (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizotypal/comments/yxgc5z/possible_problem_with_this_diagnosiss_use_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nIn my recent video I basically suggest that Schizotypal can be a therapeutic step of moving beyond Schizoprhenia, as though Schizotypal is adaptive and Schizophrenia is a full disability and not adaptive. I want to say that a clear issue with that is that there are not only a ton of people with a schizophrenia diagnosis who become healthy and adaptive, but who also thrive. On top of that, there are people who I have talked to who think I have schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia and who relate to me very well who have either of those. So while sometimes schizophrenia is incredibly severe and totally debilitating, the severity argument is all over the place on these. So I guess basically we are stuck with this situation where perhaps the best role for Schizotypal is to be seen as a mental illness for people in need of support but who don't necessarily experience hallucinations or delusions but are also a risk for homelessness and so on, but then perhaps that partially negates this other therapy message of this being something with merits to latch onto that isn't necessarily a disability to maybe work towards from schizophrenia as though the person can become adaptive, like more of a neurodivergence than purely an illness, or something more centered on therapy for attachment style damage (like anxious attachment style, avoidant attachment style, disorganized attachment style, or insecure attachment styles in general) or automatic thoughts producing anxiety from something like agoraphobia.\n\nSo I am reluctant to suggest that there is a definite answer, and on top of everything else some professionals have this same attitude about things like Narcissistic Personality Disorder where it's a homelessness risk and is bordering on psychosis itself, but, it feels like I should say all this since my framing makes it sound like an attractive label for a different type of person, when clearly a lot of us need real world help on the scale of actual schizophrenia. One more argument I would like to put forward is, if you think about it, a willingness to identify with the Schizotypal label does seem like something someone with schizotypy traits wouldn't be so unlikely to do, because when someone has identity issues, or self disorder/ipseity disturbance, looking for identity in this seems like it might follow."

I have a feeling it varies heavily by culture, but I get warm feelings from \"Aspie.\" So the question is, what could be a possibility (or multiple possibilities) for a term of endearment for Schizotypal folks?\n\nOne favorite of mine is to say in a warm way, \"oh, they have a schism! We have some Schisms!\" Or I will say to myself, \"I am not sure if I'm Schizotypal, I might be SchizoTRIPLE! Been SchizoTYPED!\" I have heard of people just saying \"schizo,\" or \"schizos,\" though that one has a faintly alienating vibe, but, probably not bad. \"Schizotypy\" itself could work. There is a line in Psychonauts 2 that went something like, \"oh, well they are just a little 'tippy,'\" which probably is about Schizotypal if you've played that game. Who knows, maybe Tim Schafer is \"a little bit tippy.\" He certainly captures the creative side of it.\n\nOne idea that doesn't seem ideal is to just also claim \"aspie.\" We had a post asking about RAADS-R scores which is themed after autism, and of course everyone that reported their score did score high or very high, which isn't really surprising because, after all, \"social disconnectedness\" and the ways that manifests seems pretty core to all of this. But, schizotypy traits do actually seem quite distinct, so they probably should be distinguished.\n\nI have been saying all sorts of stuff to myself, some favorites being warping the word \"Schizotypal\" into something that sounds like \"Scizzllllle TIPal,\" (not sure why I exaggerate the \"l\" and the \"tip\" sound, even though often it's like \"type al\"), or I will say the sentence with a raised pitch \"oh, they've been schizo type'en 'em!?!\" and I think the \"z\" sound is more infectious.\n\nIn the end, Schizotypal is a pretty fun word if you ask me, and it's easy to play with, but, just scanning for thoughts or feelings."

                "body": "So I am struggling with something. Let me try saying this fairly bluntly, there is the perspective out there that Schizotypal Personality Disorder is a diagnosis for people who are having so much trouble in their culture that they are at risk of being homeless if they aren't already, or for people with thoughts, circumstances, and personalities so malignant that they are at risk of losing their lives or freedom. We are often spending time considering its merits, and as a very-often misunderstood personality type it seems likely that is great as like a sort of hidden identity schema therapy, but it seems possible that its most important role is as a way to know someone is basically mentally ill and should have access to a system of support if needed, even if some cases are arguably just their personality traits making life in their culture difficult, though many have related conditions that have torn them from their surrounding world whether the causes are developmental trauma or not.\n\nI am struck with doubt, I realized that I have met a much more serious presentation of possible Schizotypal in my youth. When I was young, I got to spend time with a peculiar person who was houseless that a friend and I loved and often enjoyed talking to (my friend's parents let him sleep at his house often), his was a truly interesting perspective, he seemed intelligent but clearly something was off, and he wasn't capable of working despite having no physical obstacles. One time the father of my friend tried to hire him to paint a part of a house, and it took him an entire day to do almost nothing, and I know it isn't really his fault. I can picture what happened, and it would take some time to try and explain, but the point is, something I thought was OCD at the time made it too difficult to be reasonably productive, and the thought of having a job was basically tormenting to him. Now maybe it's possible that this could be summed up as \"disorganized thinking\" on the scale of actual schizophrenia, but here is the thing, I don't think this person was at risk of entering psychosis, but he still needed support on a level much higher than many of us do.\n\nYou guys have probably noticed some gatekeeping here at times, as though all the criteria of Schizotypal can be present, and even including stuff like high trait neuroticism, suspiciousness, and some scale of disorganized thoughts, but who apparently don't come across as sick enough to acceptably identify as Schizotypal. I am diagnosed by my psychologist, but I know some people here think I have no business identifying this way, while others think I have schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. I have caught myself doing it too, at one point when I saw people talking about their long successful marriages it made me want to un-diagnose them myself, but I can accept how wrongheaded that is. On a practical level of need, I can't help but consider that the ones frustrated with people like me identifying this way are right, because though some of my past jobs felt like torture, I have had some success in my work life when I was working with the public in retail settings, and despite being reclusive and my social nature being weird, I still have no problem stumbling across people who are willing to make me feel loved.\n\nOne angle is that it doesn't seem harmful for anyone to identify with someone who is basically fine, or who is stable, and if the problem is at least partly a lack of relationships and understanding, then sharing a sense of comradery and community doesn't strike me as a problem. So that's all well and good, but what if the most important part of any of this is actually the perceived level of severity prompting a need for public support? What if some people out there see my measure of success and it either makes someone feel worse or makes some influential figures think this all doesn't merit support resources, be it financial or otherwise? Like, if Schizotypal is sometimes a worse version of Avoidant Personality Disorder with more challenges requiring more support and caution, then maybe that's why professionals hand people who meet the StPD criteria an Avoidant Personality Disorder diagnosis instead.\n\nMy worry is that we can't pretend that everyone has an equal ability to adapt, even if we don't get trapped in lengthy psychosis, not everyone can be forced through the same types of full-time work weeks, fall in line with the same ridiculous culture elements, act like paragons of positivity, have a super-active social life, and happen to choose the proper retirement investments if we should be so lucky. I think there is room for arguing that we are all automatically in some form of schema therapy for identifying this way or for having the diagnose forced on someone, whether or not our lives are stable, and the fact that many people posting here seem healthy doesn't seem like it makes sense as a problem. Sometimes it makes me feel like a narcissist... I think we are all intellectually curious, especially since \"magical thinking\" seems to sometimes come from high trait openness. The conclusion I want to draw is that even though Schizotypal is supposed to be distinct from schizophrenia and less severe, receiving this diagnosis either could or should be cause for receiving extra support and understanding as if it were also a disability. For the sake of living one's own version of a good life, I think it has to make sense to perceive it as some version of schizophrenia that can adapt and not only function, but also thrive as people who much of society didn't realize have a lot to offer the world. It doesn't make sense to only identify with non-stop squalor and neuroticism, even if someone's traits make that so, it just seems like it has to make sense to consider ways to be adaptive and find peace and balance, but of course that shouldn't be at the expense of access to support.\n\nSo, there is the high degree of inconsistency already out there in the way the diagnosis is used. Like, someone like me is diagnosed and pretty much stable (I can temper my agitated symptoms if I stay off of alcohol), I was just looking for explanations for the way I am and to continue my journey to balance it out, but then historical tyrants and a list of serial killers also apparently fit someone's criteria for Schizotypal. So I guess we are in this situation where we might have to accept that sometimes it's just a person who can't figure out why they are depressed, and other times it's the most vile tyrant in history who commands powerful armies by creating a toxic personality cult. That's weird, but I think about the way Autism Spectrum Disorder has three levels that indicate how much support the person requires, so when people make a fuss about how \"normal\" they seem, they can indeed be autistic but without the same level of need. Maybe there is some way to address some of this in that way, not sure.\n\nThis is waaaaaaaaay too long, and maybe that is enough to illustrate what I'm getting at, but here is a video of R.D. Laing, an influential past psychiatrist, effectively reaching a person with paranoid schizophrenia and getting them to interact calmly with a crowd of people if you are curious: [https://youtu.be/3vCPkxjxl0s](https://youtu.be/3vCPkxjxl0s)  and even though there is a professional explaining reasons to be pessimistic, it does make it seem like the right shifts in perspective can bring someone back into the world. So, I guess my point there is maybe it isn't so damning or wrong to identify as Schizotypal, which of course is supposed to be less severe, because the people who are considered to be the most disabled by the schizophrenia spectrum are very often treatable and hopeful."

The way the world is, you can't even speak out against much of it without seeming like you've been totally toxified and propagandized. It's like a mental torture trap, and of course things like mindfulness are wonderful tools, and perhaps a sort of detachment, but then other times I trip and fall face-first into a pit of ferocious negativity that I will let myself stew in for a time, knowing full well that I will have to exit that pit however I can.

I guess I should be careful not to sound celebratory about it other than having successfully partially self-diagnosed (I say \"partially\" because I had a psychiatrist in my life who indirectly told me I can say I have a personality disorder, and yet another psychiatrist might count this as an underdiagnosis) because it's like, \"uhm, congratulations there Hinsoog, you have a personality disorder!\" So funny.\n\nAnyways, I have some notes on this after, and I want to invite you to argue any of this if you feel the desire, but here are the diagnoses from my psychological evaluation. They are \"diagnostic impressions\" since my psychologist or another psychologist can still review this and change it.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSIONS (DSM-5):\n\n299.00 (F84.0) Autism Spectrum Disorder, Without Intellectual Impairment, With Language Impairment, Level 1\n\n296.89 (F31.81) Bipolar II Disorder\n\n301.22 (F21) **Schizotypal Personality Disorder**\n\n314.00 (F90.0) ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of those numbers and letters are just codes for the DSM, ICD-9 and ICD-10 by the way. So I'm not all that surprised she thinks I also have ASD, but my first thought is that she didn't have to diagnose me with ASD because I think it technically isn't by the book to diagnose ASD together with Schizotypal at the same time, maybe partly because they just overlap so much even though they are different, so maybe this is a case where you maybe should just make a decision. The decision has been clear to me for quite a while now, I am Schizotypal. But, I also met the criteria for ASD for her, so it's just as well.\n\nI have written a lot about Schizotypal, and people's perceptions of it and its severity are just completely all over the place, but what I want to say is if the Schizotypal label gives you some comfort for being some scale of loner, feeling weird, feeling apprehensive about humanity, getting stuck in your head however often, being fanciful in a way that allows for conceptual leaps before every statement was anchored in reality, being ruminative and neurotic, not wanting to fully identify as human or whatever else, feeling distrustful, suspicious, or paranoid, or feeling like your thoughts can be a little everywhere, then I don't think it's bad for you to claim the Schizotypal label, because by definition you have the capacity to be rational, and it's adaptive. The only caveat to add is if you do this with a professional they can perhaps help you dig out of a possible rut in a way that you can manage. We still want to envision what a properly full life is for us.\n\nThere is no reason to devalue yourself for claiming this label, and in fact the prevailing culture is arguably sick in a way that someone with a naturally different perspective and who is often misaligned with the culture might have an advantage for unearthing valuable perspectives.\n\nAnyways, I already felt like a clear case of Schizotypal, but I am happy to have it on paper from a professional since I enjoy being part of this on Reddit and on YouTube."

                "body": "Hey folks, so personality disorders are at a high risk of alcoholism, and pretty often it gets bad enough I think it's a giant part of what leads many to full-on schizophrenia at its most debilitating, so as a severe alcoholic myself who is giving it up for good after a still uncomfortably-recent relapse, I feel the need to throw ideas for preventing relapse into the ring, one of which miiiiiight be a little controversial, but should do the job.\n\nAlcohol has swung through my entire life like a wrecking ball, and its wake of destruction has touched everything in my world, everything. I think a big part of the issue is some of us get a MASSIVE explosion of dopamine from alcohol binges that can at times be intensely rewarding, so rewarding in fact that I think it warps the way we look at the world, as though it can turn life into just a game of seeking out the various dopamine highs that surround us instead of building healthy sources of natural highs, like developing a skill, hobbies, or taking care of our bodies. So then there is this downwards spiral that just hollows me out, and life can seem like just alcohol all the while relationships suffer and my health, especially heart health, plummets rapidly before my eyes.\n\nIn a way, when alcoholism gets bad enough at least it's easy to see in a way that's hard to hide from the math equation of it: find sustainable healthy highs that aren't destroying everything, or life will be cut dramatically short. But even then, there is negative self-talk that can happen where I myself will justify a relapse knowing full well that it's a dead end and I will have the painful task of giving it up all over again. Every time I have relapsed I have lost something important. Every. Time. My last relapse even put my relationship with my family in peril, which is a profound betrayal because despite my culturally rebellious nature where I challenge their traditional value systems almost automatically, my family has shown me an unbelievable amount of support and love in a way that is hard to feel like I deserve. Well it was time, there is too much in life worth looking forward to for me to be putting all of it in peril, the pattern is clear, moderation isn't possible for me, and alcohol really is a bad pair of dice that eventually ends in something like psychosis where I am lashing out at someone for something that wasn't even close to being worth damaging the relationship over, so for overall happiness (the good highs go away eventually with regular alcohol binging, leaving mostly pain), for longevity, and for people who care about me, I am finished with alcohol. Sometimes the stuff I freak out about while super drunk is worth having arguments over, but when I am lashing out about it while drunk not only is any good message lost, but somehow I become all the things I loathe. Some relationships probably do need help being ended, but of course alcohol is the worst way to do it.\n\nIt's really, really hard to re-earn trust after yet another relapse, it gets to the point where it is a betrayal, so then it's a mix of time, healing, and making plans for preventing relapses. My final strategy for sealing this shut is to work with my psychologist and letting them know that I am probably in-range of needing neuroleptics/anti-psychotics already, but that if I remain free of alcohol then I believe I can successfully get by without them, so if I were to fail (I won't), it's time for costly rehab and to begin the medication as a sort of Hail Mary. This was actually inspired by an interaction with a psychiatrist a while back that completely blindsided me, before I knew I had personality disorders, because almost immediately they were trying to get me on something that almost certainly was a neuroleptic/anti-psychotic, and the way he tried selling it to me was that it should reduce cravings and even if I were to take shots of alcohol they should only make me sick instead of giving me the giant dopamine explosion that makes me become unhinged. It was a little bit upsetting at the time, but now I see the wisdom in it, and I think it can be a wonderful way to have leverage on myself to make sure my family knows I am serious and so they know there is another important tool available. I know there is plenty good reason for people to be on those medications even when sober since some people don't need alcohol to enter their version of psychosis, but I am confident in my plan.\n\nI did this in video form too!

I don't think it's any coincidence that people with depression also have an inability to focus, and I want to argue that ADHD is in a way small-scale schizophrenia because it's like this first step to one's focus just kind of running away from the torment of the environment.\n\nI think what starts happening is once people start finding that the world isn't really a dependable way to meet their needs, and they can just start escaping into an internal world and the lovely world of videogames, music, books, movies etc. it can kind of just keep scaling up and people start even stop identifying with anything concrete about the world they are just sort of functioning in. Then we just sort of focus on the world just enough to function in it so that we can escape back into our minds and other worlds. It's like there is a cultural narrative people start filing into, and it's mostly just an absurd slog, and people on the schizophrenia-spectrum, including Schizotypal, Schizoid, and full-blown Schizophrenia finally start freeing themselves from it in one way or another, perhaps even on a physiological way eventually. Social worlds seem like they are similar in that it's just mostly a constant barrage of stuff that starts feeling like nonsense from outside our internal world, so we leave it where we can.\n\nIt's not a perfect explanation for why some of us have always had pretty loud eccentricities and haven't willingly launched ourselves into the social worlds/narratives around us, so of course a lot of it is still hardwired into us, but I still want to argue that the callous nature of the world as well as the anomie in the current world make being Schizotypal make more sense than just attempting a cookie-cutter take on the neurotypical world. So we decide we are weird and detach and are actually better for it, and the detachment even breeds some clarity that some others don't receive instead of vice-versa if we don't let the isolation claim us with resentment or depression. Because if someone wants to identify as some kind of intuitive being that needs a lot of time alone to think and reflect, or perhaps a spiritual being in tune with the universe, or even something like just identifying as a pirate, then who is to stop them when most of the cultural and social narrative around them is largely toxic? I say having one foot in reality and one foot out is probably the way to go, so Schizotypal it is!\n\nI also did this in video form, and am very proud of my picture of Schizotypal as an adaptation if you are in the mood for that sort of thing:\n\n[https://youtu.be/y\\_o8T59zyRo](https://youtu.be/y_o8T59zyRo)"

I suspect that Schizotypal can subsume the Borderline traits to the point where maybe there is no actual point in saying that one is comorbid with Borderline, but the fact is that whatever happens for Borderlines where like the hidden hyper-critical portion of their brain wakes up and tears hopes of a romantic relationship to absolute threads is so relatable to me that I can't shake it, though I would argue that, at least at a more mature age, whatever monster that that hyper-critical portion of me represents is more balanced and present in a way that maybe I could stabilize and control for the sake of a good relationship, though it has me reluctant to start trying to begin with.\n\nThe other part of this is my past alcoholism really did a number on my life, relationships, and probably my total outlook on life, maybe partly because you realize that life is just a hunt for dopamine spikes, and the more natural the source of the dopamine the more rewarding, but it doesn't change the fact that life starts seeming like a game for balancing dopamine sources, and it's hard not to just continually rely on \"safe\" sources like video games, getting likes on YouTube or Reddit, or stuff like that. I can't help but imagine that substance use disorder is also somehow foundational to at least Borderline, and even though I was always probably going to be a weird, overly-thoughtful loner type, I still think alcohol is a large part of why I am who I am now, and I am proud to be over 1 year and 10 months alcohol-free, but I am now getting a liiiiitle dependent on THC which REALLY seems to spurn on the perceptual games I play with myself, so the journey continues in that way.\n\nAnyways, I am curious about any thoughts on this, and I also am awfully proud of a video I just did that touches on this stuff if you are in the mood for that sort of thing:\n\n[https://youtu.be/oIcUN06syss](https://youtu.be/oIcUN06syss)\n\nThank you!!"

I'm really trying to understand what is in it and how to translate it into a practical application of things I want to do but it's not helping at all.\n\nfor example, I have a couple of zibgee plugs that are controlling a couple of window AC units, that so far I have combined as a switch group. However, when trying to understand how to associate this switch group with a thermostat card, the climate entity section falls flat on its face. I just don't understand where to go, what to do, if or when I have questions I have to shoot in 5 different directions to get some answers...\n\nI guess what i'm asking is if there's any resource out there that is practical, pragmatic, user friendly, not incredibly generalized, and use case focused with some proper how to's to accomplish what I'm looking to get done?  Any and all help would be appreciated.  \n\n\nEdit for clarity: To be totally understandable I am using 2 Window AC Air Conditioners. I am using 2 zigbee plugs over ZHA to control their operation, and a BLE ESP32 dev board that communicates with a temperature meter over MQTT publishing BLE meter data to HA though Mosquitto.    \n\n\nI already have a static automation rule set for controlling this, I am just at a loss for understanding how to have an adjustable thermostat card on my home dashboard to control them both."

As a result, I'm looking for an extensive ABC index for this type of correlation/use case, unless i'm completely mistaken in this approach to this topic.

One of them is controlled by the tensor chip via Android system intelligence, and the other one is controlled by Gboard's **legacy** voice typing input.\n\n Once I figured this out, I realized that this is a huge problem because the phone is listening for input but receiving voice input data from two inputs, thus having two outputs whenever it's done. You can disable this absolutely fucking annoying nuisance by going into your language and input settings and disabling Google voice typing (legacy). So far I have not had a problem with any more of these ridiculous double outputs whenever I begin a new round of voice typing. Hopefully this fixes this problem in case some of you have been having it, I know I'm not the only one considering how there were others in forums asking about it so yeah. Enjoy.\n\nEdit: It has come to my attention that I forgot to include a direct instruction on how to access these settings so i'll include them here for posterity and user friendliness:\n\nTo accomplish this, go to\n\nSettings -> Languages + input -> On-screen keyboard -> + Manage on-screen keyboards -> toggle \"Google Voice Typing [Legacy]\" to the off position\n\ncredit goes to u/Mathlete86"

He barely tells anyone about how he really thinks or feels, he only expresses opinions when he thinks he's\"right\", which leads to a serious problem that he constantly refuses to see himself objectively and won't admit he's wrong by silence and inaction(lil passive-aggressive behaviors).\n\nI think his avoidance and insecurity-strong desires has something to do with his past. He was raised in a small village and managed to get into a prestigious university through China's strict Gaokao(college entrance examination) and got a doctor's degree in law and got a fair job. However, he always wants more. His true motivation is to be better than anyone else. Thus he doesn't read, doesn't make friends, just wanting to stay in his bubble and safely admire his ego.\n\nHe was a \"normal\" person, a devoted father, and a seemingly responsible husband(1). His motivations become more dangerous when he got older. He's always a heavy drinker(2), and finally, he had an epilepsy attack as a result in May, last year. Combining the descriptions above you can know that his drinking leads to this problem and he still refuses to get help by avoiding medical examinations on brain functions and discussions on his problems. Worse, he KEPT HEAVY DRINKING even he was told by the doctor that he is not even supposed to drink something like coke. He doesn't dare to look at the reality and pretends nothing will happen. My mother and I tried persuasion, arguments, comfort, or whatever and he won't act but use the newly gained acceptance to get drunk, then the persuasion session again. A disturbing loop.\n\nIronically, I heard from my mom what has happened last night when I was asleep--he was drunk again, half-naked and lost, brought back to home by police officers. My mom has had too many fruitless arguments over the past two years and now she is crying. She doesn't deserve this, but she can't divorce because of financial issues and me. I feel that I have to make some move but not knowing what to do since my personality is strongly influenced by my father thus I find it hard to express feelings or care for close family members, and I may not be able to see these things objectively or normally.\n\nAfter all, I seek opinions and advice from you.\n\n(If you have advice for presents for the upcoming Father's day, please do. We're trying to encourage him.)\n\n(1) Respect to my mom. My mom is smart, loyal, pretty, and funny, they had a not-bad time when younger. However, with aging my dad always attempts to grope whatever women within his reach in a discreet way. He'd come too close with his reluctant female colleagues when having dinner, discreetly shooting female body parts when on an airplane. \n\n(2) He doesn't buy drinks, his habit is to reluctantly accept an invitation to a meal and drink A LOT more than anyone else. He's conscious enough to know that drinking is bad. Ironic and make things more complex."

Even though other games I remember being related to that can easily be found on those \u201cgames for kids\u201d website, this one didn\u2019t really qualify as a \u201cgame\u201d that much so I\u2019ve been having a super hard time finding it archived anywhere.\n\nSome more details I just found: Wiz-tober happened in 2008 and 2009, which I think somewhat lines up with me interacting with this. It might not have even run on flash because it was so simplistic. It probably was on the disneychannel.com/wiztober website, but I can\u2019t access it for obvious reasons."

At the start of the no sleeping I did go down below for less than 5 minutes but thunderstorms would have lasted longer than that. I have paused and quit the game numerous times but do those impact the .5-7.5 day delay? If it is a bug with thunderstorms in 1.16 that\u2019s fine I just want to know so that I can stop getting hassled by phantoms while working on my iron farm and sleep the mobs away. If there isn\u2019t one however I will hold out for another 5 days and call it quits."

                "body": "As we all know, the trial tragically ends with Terry Fawles killing himself to fulfill his promise to Dahlia Hawthorne, before Dahlia can be rightfully incriminated. This emotionally scars Mia to the point where she cannot enter court until she is able to get closure from this incident in 3-1. \n\nWhat\u2019s more interesting in my eyes is how Edgeworth reacts to this. He seems equally as upset about this as Mia, he panics and screams out for the judge to stop the trial. Mia even notes in the epilogue of 3-4 that the incident likely scarred Edgeworth just as badly as her. \n\nOf course, it makes perfect sense that he would be upset that a man committed suicide right in front of him. However, it\u2019s interesting to me to see how upset Edgeworth gets over the prospects of Terry dying when literal minutes ago he was tirelessly arguing for Terry to be sentenced to death for the murder of Valerie Hawthorne. In the outcome of Fawles surviving somehow, Edgeworth would still have wanted Fawles to be convicted, thereby sentenced to death. This seems to illustrate some serious cognitive dissonance in Edgeworth\u2019s mind.\n\nTherefore, I think this trial illustrates an important aspect of Edgeworth\u2019s character pre Turnabout Goodbyes: Edgeworth was never emotionally or morally numb like the series suggests, he was just merely conditioned by Von Karma not to consider the implications and morals of his prosecuting. \n\nOf course, a victory for Edgeworth means the death of someone, guilty or not. This effectively makes Edgeworth responsible for their deaths, whether they are observed or not. The live of these people are quite literally in Miles\u2019 hands. Therefore, in order to pursue the guilty verdict as aggressively as he does, he would either have to not care about death and be a sociopath, or separate himself from the implications of a guilty verdict entirely. \n\nIf Edgeworth truly believed Fawles was guilty, he would still be shocked by the suicide and traumatized, but he would still have justified sentencing him to death because he was truly guilty of the crime. How upset and traumatized Edgeworth seems to be seems to suggest that he also knew he was innocent. \n\nTherefore, I\u2019d say this scene provides some important characterization for Edgeworth: that he\u2019s entirely disconnected from the implications of his job. He knew he Fawles innocent (evidenced by his reaction to the suicide), and was upset about his death (despite arguing for a guilty verdict and using underhanded tricks). However, he\u2019s not morally broken and was upset about these things, he just has an effective moral blind spot when it comes to his work. \n\nOf course this might not mean much since anyone would be upset if someone infested poison in front of them. But still, the degree of attention given to Edgeworth here indicates some interesting characterization around his morals pre AA1"

What I mean is: let's say the player a scored then the ball will reset at the middle point and will move towards the player a. I want the reseted balls first moving speed to be always the same. And I also want to directional speeds dx dy to be different, so that each time it resets the ball can move from the start point at different angles(I don't know if this makes sense). So that's why I wanted to use (x*x) + (y*y) = a. In the equation a is the speed I want to set for the resetted ball. Thanks a lot by the way, i hope i can do this with squared numbers also:)",

They didn't teach me anything, just order me to do it. Cycling for example. Ended in their anger and disappointment when I fail. Even with homework. I think that has a big impact on me.\n\nAnd school was where another big incompetence begins. I am clueless about how to be social. So I was ostracized and ridiculed for being strange throughout the school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Main points:**\n\nI see myself in a negative way because\n\n1. Personal - I don't believe in myself. I have no support, physically and emotionally when trying new things. l always feel awkward and timid when doing new things or in social situations. That \"I don't know how to do it, please don't yell at me\" Child self is still there in my heart. I just want to do things I'm new to it without judging/criticizing myself so negatively.\n2. Social - I believe I'm unspecial, dull, and unlikable. My school memory reminds me that I'm a different species from most people and they are not happy with this species. It makes me lonely to not able to freely connect with people. Can't find gf. And got anxiety. And another thing is I'm prone to get ridiculed... for my low social skill, my kid-like voice (I'm afraid to use my voice), my \"out of place\" personality, my vulnerability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to be able to believe and trust in myself. No more timidity. Be more social. And have the looks of 'I'm proud to be me'.\n\nI need your advice."

(if you want to be able to go back and pull up a full transit chart for an event, this is super helpful) \n\nanyway, i'm happy this has helped you to continue the exploration of your chart! i promise it gets better after saturn steps off your neck a little lol",

I was recently thinking about using some kind of app on my phone that I can easily keep track of the foods I eat and possibly more accurate calculate and keep track of the calories, nutrition that is in my diet. \n\nI am just a bit unsure about this because a lot of the apps on the market are aimed for people for weight loss, and usually perpetuate a negative mindset of calorie restriction. My goal is to keep better track of the foods I am eating and I want to make sure I am actually consuming enough calories/fats/nutrients for a balanced healthy diet that can help me gain weight. \n\nI eat pretty clean, I rarely eat out, I eat almost no processed foods and try to make everything at home. So if an app can help me calculate eg, the calories of the English muffins that I make myself at home that would be a plus.\n\nThanks again for reading my long posts and do let me know if you have used any of these apps before!"

Ramen, from japan, Spaghettis, from Italy, there's just so many! And the texture is just so good, the way the noodles effortlessly and seamlessly flow into your mouth makes you almost ejaculate with happiness. And we haven't even talked about all the different flavors yet! Because plain noodles are flavorless, you can add basically anything to noodles to make them taste good, and also because of this, anything can be paired with noodles and instantly be better because of its texture paired with the foods texture! And don't even get me started on their beauty, like seriously, how are they so beautiful? Like whenever you see a bowl of noodles, they are just the most perfect golden color, and when they come out fresh from the boiling water, their glistening shine just makes them irresistible to any potential consumer. Noodles as a whole are just the most beautiful, tasty, and godsent thing humanity has ever created, and if not everyone on earth gets to try noodles, than that will be earths greatest shame."

I never installed or use WhatsApp on my iphone at all. I'm thinking of a technique to keep my old iphone data as well and get whatsapp from android. Please tell me if this wud work.\n\n1.\tBack up all iphone data to itunes or Icloud after updating to iOS 16.\n2.\tFactory reset iphone and move whatsapp from android using move to iOS app.\n3.\tInstall whatsapp and take backup of whatsapp in Icloud using the backup options inside whatsapp app.\n4.\tFactory reset iphone again and restore backup made in step1.\n5.\tInstall whatsapp and pull whatsapp backup from Icloud.\n6.\tThus get old iphone data and whatsapp together.\n\n\nI am not a pro here. So let me know if this would work. If I hadn't made my objective clear it is this : move whatsapp data from android using move to iOS app AND also keep my previous data.\n\n\nUpdate : this worked!\n\nFollow these steps:(requires factory reset twice)\n\n1.\tBack up all iphone data to itunes or Icloud after updating to iOS 16.\n2.\tIn your android phone, try to trim down the size of whatsapp data. See gdrive whatsapp backup size to determine the size of transfer. Delete unnecessary photos, videos and documents because this transfer took 30 mins for 2.3gb of data for me. If you don't want to delete, copy them to ur pc and delete them from your phone. If your whatsapp size is huge, you might be sitting hours together without being able to use both ur phones until the transfer is done.\n3.\tFactory reset iphone, skip icloud backup when it happens here automatically, and move whatsapp from android using Move to iOS app. \n4.\tYou have to pick start fresh option and then copy data from android option here. NOTE: KEEP BOTH PHONES CONNECTED TO POWER THROUGHOUT THE TRANSFER. DON'T USE BOTH PHONES UNTIL TRANSFER IS DONE.\n5.\tFinish rest of the setup (choose some random things as we have to factory reset again) and go to home screen. \n6.\tLogin to icloud in settings. Install whatsapp from appstore. Dont update anyother apps. Once whatsapp is installed, enter ur phone no and verify it and whatsapp will automatically recognise that data has been moved from android and it try to restore it. After that happens, take backup of whatsapp in Icloud using the backup options inside whatsapp app.\n7.\tFactory reset iphone again and skip icloud backup again and restore backup made in step 1 in set up process.\n8.\tAll your apps and data will start downloading in the bavkground, so wait patiently.\n9.\tInstall whatsapp and pull whatsapp backup from Icloud. Now you get old iphone data and whatsapp together."

Recently, the app doesn't  start saying the device time is not correct. I go to settings and the time and date has been reset to Jan 1 2020 5 am. I had manually set it to the correct time and date after disabling the option to set time automatically via the internet but it keeps resetting every 1 or 2 days back to 2020. Somehow other apps like netflix aren't affected by this issue and they work fine.\n\n\nSecond issue is a wifi issue. This is one of the reasons why set automatic time doesn't work some times leading to the above mentioned issue with disney plus app. Although idk why time resets to 2020 in the first place every 1 or 2 days. I can get clear wifi on my phone, laptop, etc but on tv it says \"No signal on sever\". I have a wifi 6 mesh router from tplink deco and there is only one ssid (no separate one of 5ghz and 2.4ghz). So I don't really know what to do with this. This issue is random because other times everything works - no wifi issue or time issue.\n\nAny idea on troubleshooting? I realise that I should not have updated the os now :("

No, they gave back only the amount after the interest of the bank was discounted. Invoice was for 266k. They gave back only 254k. When asked they told me to contact the bank. When I asked the bank they told me to ask lenovo.\n\nDid a bit of digging and it looks like the missing 12k amount is not possible to get back. Anyways I'm planning to file a case in the consumer court just to see what happens.\n\n\nTLDR: If the product you buy via no cost emi is faulty and if you have already started paying emis before it is returned, you will not get the full amount on your invoice as refund. The bank interested will be deducted."

Is one wise, investing in their defensive assets?\n\n:Considering kind(err) fixtures on paper; Sanchez is the stand out GK option and perhaps Veltman- both offering value at 4.5?\n\nMy issue with Sanchez is less of save points and thus, bonus points and hence, lesser ceiling --short term and long haul -- considering iff one invests 9-9.5 on GK: Better combinations out there?\n\n2. Sorcery: Fine(more than decent) fixtures but, attack being overlooked?\n\n:With Bissouma a lock-in 4.5 mid in my team and prolly the safest 2 pointer bench fodder, Grob ain't being considered.\nThereby smoothly moving to forward talk: aren't Maupay/Welbeck being overlooked? In my humble opinion, better shoutout than Toney or any forward<7.5?\n\nSuper drafting snowflake, striving for balance: unable to decide a formation this season; would love to have more diss-cuss-ion to gather insights and be more enlightened.

I love this show, the characters, the art, the actors, the classical music, our lord and savior Bryan, and this lovely and insanely creative fandom!\n\nI will never stop engaging with the meta, the fics, the fan art, and the memes. I even made a godforsaken tumblr account to enable this behavior of mine even more. I will never stop clowning over the \u201cseason 4\u201d articles that pop up in google suggestions every goddamn week. I even bought and read a book called \u201cHannibal for Dinner\u201d which was basically officially published meta (a very good series of essays, btw, so shout out to the author/curator). \n\nYes, I am way too invested, and I don\u2019t even think it is a bad thing. This show just pulled me out of a long period of depression. It made me \u201cfeel\u201d things for the first time in months.  The power of art. \n\nGiving mentally ill queer people the most fucked up media representation is exactly what this mentally ill queer person needed and Bryan DELIVERED. We stan a king. I also would\u2026 um.. kill for a season 4 (and more) of murder husbands but I do realize how unlikely that is. \n\nTLDR: thanks to Bryan and his incredibly BEAUTIFUL masterpiece, I am a mess. And I love it. Going through some tough times these days and that prompted me to just put it out there that I am grateful for this show and this community."

                "body": "So I took my late 2016 15\u201d MacBook Pro to the Genius Bar on Nov. 20. They told me the repair (changing the top case as I had a failing keyboard and battery) would take approximately 7 days. I left the laptop for the repair and picked up a 16\u201d M1 Max a few days later because I can\u2019t live without a laptop and an upgrade was long overdue. I still told them before leaving the laptop for repair that I was a student on the verge of finals weeks with projects and finals looming and they assured me that I would have my MBP back in no time. I got an email from apple that my repair was on hold because they ordered a part needed for the repair. This was on Nov. 23. It is STILL on hold because of the same part. \n\nI have called the apple store where I left my laptop multiple times, I\u2019ve spoken to apple support on chat and and on the phone, they just never seem to help. They keep telling me that they\u2019re still waiting for a part and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m honestly so done! I\u2019m flying out of state for a month for the winter break so by the time I\u2019m back I won\u2019t have my laptop for a total of 50 days because of how Apple has (or rather, hasn\u2019t) handled my repair.  I just wanna know who I can complain to about this. \n\nNot even once was this acknowledged as the big deal that it is when I was on the phone with support or with the store, like imagine if I hadn\u2019t bought a new laptop and had to go through finals without a laptop because apple took too long to repair it??? i am so pissed, I just can\u2019t believe how irresponsible they can be. I\u2019ve heard of some stories where people were able to complain about a repair and get a brand new MacBook Pro shipped to them; if anyone has had a similar experience please share it! Who should I contact in this case? I\u2019m so tired of calling support. I\u2019ve called them a total of 5+ times because of this."

But for someone who\u2019s presumably a genius, he makes way too many mistakes justifying them with his nonsensical moral code. I disliked him my first time watching and thought maybe I was missing something, since he is very popular. My nth rewatch right now and I\u2019m almost done and I realize that I still can\u2019t get myself to like him. \n\nHis attitude towards team machine AND the machine herself, his self-righteousness, and the fact that he gets a happy ending (gets to live and go to the love of his life) when John and Root don\u2019t, when HE IS responsible for everything that happened to them just pushes me over the edge about him. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved the finale, but that last scene with Grace just made me hate Finch even more. His wrong decisions cost his friends everything and he got a free pass to \u201cnormal life\u201d with his fianc\u00e9. I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I really had to get that out of my system. I would\u2019ve been happier if he had died instead of Root & John."

When I opened the official decision on my portal, I saw another note congratulating me on being designated as one of the \u201cprestigious\u201d C. P. Davis scholars. \n\nThe first thing after seeing my official decision, I checked my financial aid offer and noticed that my entire financial aid money comes from the C. P. Davis Grant. Due to this, I got nearly 6k$ more financial aid from Columbia than from Harvard (I got 0 contribution, 0 in loans from both, but no term-time work at Columbia vs. 8-12 hours/week term-time work at Harvard). That\u2019s obviously fantastic, but I was also wondering if anyone has had any experience with this type of offer (being named a scholar in particular)? What are the other advantages and benefits of being named a scholar?  \n\nAnd finally, should I choose Columbia over Harvard? Can you elaborate on reasons why (other than the financial aid)? I\u2019m seriously having a hard time deciding! \n\nThank you!!"

If a creature bites them the creature has to make a con save and if fails takes 1d4 poison damage.\n*Dying sence*: due to the fact butterflies can smell a dying creature from miles away, Leapateria have the ability to know if something is dying from 15ft away. They cant see it unless it is in their sight.\n     **LANGUAGE'S**:  This race knows common, sylvan, and a language that only Leapateria can understand due to it being spoken through clicking/chirping sounds along with hormones with no words said.

Three subraces are in this race. \n*Gynnidomera*:(moths) 7ft-8ft but can be down to 5ft on rate occasions. +1 to Constitution.\n*Rhophalora*:(butterflies) 6ft-7ft but can be from 5ft-8ft rarely. +1 to intelligence.  \n*Hespedinea*:(skippers) range from 5ft-6ft but can be anywhere from 7ft-8ft rarely. +1 to dex\n    **APEARANCE**: The race usually have 4 arms and two legs(no hair but gynnidomeras and hespedinea can have silk like fur.) And thin insect like wings. Sometimes they can have 4 legs and 2 arms or even 3 legs and 3 arms or no arms at all due to mutations. Gynnidomeras and hespedineas can have fur around their necks, forearms, and legs. They sometimes have patterns on their fur/skin/wings. Eyebrows are the same as their antenna.

And every time it was at the end of my dream so i didnt really get time to do anything.\n\nThe first time was in a nightmare in which i was getting chased by some swarm of poisonous bees that had basically killed my family. At the very end i realized \"wait im dreaming so if i kill myself then ill wake up\" so i walked into the swarm and that was that.\n\nThe second time was a bit better. Basically i jumped into a pool and realized that i was dreaming when i started breathing underwater. It was such a cool feeling until i woke up 5 seconds later.\n\nSo now im really interested in trying to do it but I watched some youtube videos that explained the method of reality checking yourself and there were a lot of comments saying that everytime they realized they were dreaming they instantly got sleep paralysis. And i am scared shitless of the thought of sleep paralysis so does it just depend on the person or are there precautions you can take to avoid it? Could there be alternate methods that would make it less likely to happen? Thanks in advance for reading."

Like making money? \n\nHow can you be a raising talent and haven\u2019t earned anything? Most people don\u2019t even open my proposal so I\u2019m confused. Does everyone who just starts gets one after a few days? (I got the badge three days after)\n\nI looked it up online and still doesn\u2019t make sense considering the explanation of what a \u201craising talent\u201d is.\n\nI would appreciate any input about your opinion on this and how I can make the most out of that badge, thank you in advance for your time!"

People are just people, and we are all more similar than we'd like to believe. A person who does bad things need to get responsibility for it, but they're not a monster and not that different from the rest of us.\n\nThere's a line in Dante's Purgatorio where he says that everyone, put in the right conditions, would kill others. I like it, but not because it's edgy, just because it reminds me that people are more often the product of their environment rather than nature.\n\n I went a bit on a tangent but I wanted to say that many fans see Bojack as a villain and nothing else and it's wrong. He's just a person, as each one of us. If we try to distantiate ourselves from the people we deem evil too much, we lose our humanity. There is a balance for everything.",

Nothing too crazy, but I'm not a total beginner either. \nNow, I've decided I want to take music lessons again but I'm torn between singing and piano.\n\nThey're both things I love and that I eventually want to learn but the point is in two years I'm going to college and I don't know if I'll have the time or money to learn a new instrument. Besides, even if I do, I'd still have to wait some years.\n\nAs for singing, I've always loved to sing but I just can't do it. Not only I don't sound good, I can't even hit notes. My range is super small and I often feel like I can't even sing, let alone sing decently. I also usually get sore after about 15/20 minutes.\n\nNow for piano, I've always loved its sound. I enjoy both classical and jazz piano and I'd love to learn how to read music and explore theory some more. I'd love to write and compose my own stuff.\n\nWhat do you think would be the best first choice? Or do you have any suggestions? I just can't afford lessons in both things right now."

What I saw was a man shitting in a toilet (I think it was diarrhea if you really wanna know). \n\nI could feel from far away how warm and humid his anus was and I immediately thought of how it could have been an amazing place to live. I steadely tried to get into his back door when this mf started dancing and jumping around, leaving the room completely covered in shit. I thought that it was quite weird but, excited by my new home, I didn't think much of it.\n\nToday, attracted by the smell of some honeydew, I decided to leave his butthole to go grab a snack when I saw him yelling, holding his micropenis like a sword and firing his own urine against me, thus killing me.\n\nSo reddit, AITA for being just a fly who wanted to live peacefully in his new home and getting killed for it?"

The top half is covered in a thick forest of milky human\\-sized arms and hands \\(without fingernails\\), while the bottom half consists of the orb of a single unblinking eye. The eye color is green with streaks of gold the size of suns. She is transtemporal, and through her eye absorbs all light that ever was and ever will be.\n\nHer work, her duty is in two parts. The first is to observe all mortal behavior and judge it. The second is that when judgement demands, she opens a rift in space and gently extends one of her billions of arms into the body of her target. Then, the flesh of that hand is reverse transubstantiated while inside the poor mortal.\n\nFor Chymebidyr is deity of tertiary bodily fluids. All snot, all phlem, rheum, bile and pus are actually \\*her\\* skin and muscle and bones made liquid, made potent. When you wake and wipe the dust from your eyes, speak a word to Chymebidyr. When your infected wound spouts pus, pray to Chymebidyr. When it's the fifth day of your flu and your raw nose is a faucet, cry to Chymebidyr for mercy.\n\nRemember that her hands are within you."

It seemed like the right thing to do but I guess it's personal preference. At my previous school where I didn't have such a good relationship with the head I don't think I would have said anything.",

He took his men to a cave where they could rest for the night while he sought counsel from the Lord. As he prayed he could hear his men talk of killing him. He asked the Lord what do to and the Lord said to go after his family and that not a hair on their heads would be harmed. But what the Bible doesn\u2019t show us is the constant humble patience David demonstrated in waiting for the Lord to speak to him. I, myself, would ask the Lord what He would have me do and I would pray that when all was said and done that the Lord\u2019s name would be glorified. The Word of God says, (John 12:32) \u201cIf I be lifted up I will draw all men unto Me\u201d. As long as our lives glorify the Lord, we can\u2019t lose.\n\nEDIT: David and his men caught up with the Philistines, rescued their families and ransacked the camp of their enemies. (1Samuel 30)",

We catch up and swap pics of our kids and then she wants a pic of me. I don't take them. Never have. I tell her that. Now my spidey senses are starting to tingle because she is becoming politely insistent. She signs off by reminding me to send that picture, (because she wants pictures of ALL her family). I get off of messenger and do the math and realize we haven't seen each other in 45 years. It's close to ten years since we texted last. Then I realize my older sister and former guardian, must have put her up to this. From the time I was 14 til I was 16, I  lived with my older sister who was 19 - 21. She beat me viciously the whole time. She beat me because she didn't like the way I stored the leftover chicken or because I didn't fix her lunch or because I *did* fix her lunch. The beatings lasted 10 - 45 minutes. Usually about 30 minutes. I tried so hard to be as obedient as I could. She was using marijuana (I'm not throwing shade, if you use it that's up to you) and had started using harder drugs. It was so horrible. When I was 13 and living with our older brother he beat and raped me. A week later I found Jesus Christ. So living with my sister I thought I was being bad. I would go to school and some of the neighbor kids would tease me (in front of my friends) saying, \"Boy, you could really hear moonkittycat screaming last night. Ha ha. Your sister must have been beating you good.\" Finally, the police removed me from the home but, not before making me disrobe to my underclothes and taking pictures of the bruises left where she had broken a broom in 4  places on me. The nightmares I have had since then I won't bore you with. Six years ago she was in the area and \"wanted to meet her nephew\". I was so sick and scared. My son messaged her that, considering our past that it wasn't a good idea.  I was a grown woman with a 19-year-old son, why was I scared? Idk but I woke up in the middle of the night and she was there, in my room, floating in the dark, an apparition, a phantom of my fear still haunting me. I am actively working on forgiving them but I don't hear the Lord telling me to reach out to her and I have asked Him.  Then my son, who is 25 now, called me today crying and incoherent. I was so afraid. A dear friend that was an aunt to him his whole life had died.  \"Mom, I'm sorry I forgot to tell you I went to see her a few weeks ago and she asked me to tell you that you were the reason she started talking to God and she asked me to thank you for that\". When he said that, I felt that \"ring of fire\" that June Carter wrote about and her husband, Johnny Cash sang about. Cheryl taught me that I wasn't as generous as I thought and not to be afraid to yell for help. But it burns, the love burns. Thanking Jesus for all of this and for my friend Daniel finally getting a job. We serve a mighty God."

I have started to lose weight already. The stress of not having that monkey on my back is relief enough, Praise God Almighty. I'm ashamed to say, my first thought was, why now? I feel like I am so old. I am thankful though. My mother was severely mentally ill. I won't go into that. What she did give me was something more valuable than money. She gave me the word of God. She did Bible studies with us a lot. She planted that seed within me. A week after the rape, I gave my life to Jesus Christ and He has been with me ever since. Thank God for my angel mother. This past July 29th marks 46 years of walking with the Lord. As I get older this world loses its luster and nothing excites me anymore. Seeing my child happy is good. The only thing that excites me is Jesus. Knowing Him better. Knowing the mysteries of His ways. He said in His word that He will reveal secret things and He does."

I don't agree with it entirely but I think it will help someone else.\n\n## Living in Friday, Waiting For Sunday\n\nOne final point is in order. Although God was at work in the betrayal, you couldn\u2019t see it that night. Peter didn\u2019t see it, he only saw the treachery of Judas. Nothing that happened to Jesus that night or later on Good Friday made sense when it happened. It only made sense on Sunday morning when Jesus rose from the dead.\n\nThat\u2019s generally the way life is for all of us. The greater the pain, the harder it is to see God\u2019s fingerprints. In those moments we often feel alone in the chaos of circumstances as life tumbles in around us. It is only as we look back that we see clearly that God was there all along, working behind the scenes for our good and his glory.\n\nWe live most of our days in Good Friday\u2014enduring confusion, opposition, disappointment and the many tragedies of life. Now and then we advance to Easter morning where we discover God\u2019s purpose in our pain. But most of the time we won\u2019t see it fully until we finally arrive in heaven.\n\nIn the words of a 19th century writer, hatred, treachery and deceit will not prevail against the church of God. Every evil in the world must somehow serve God\u2019s purpose.\n\nWhat is our response to this truth?\n\nA) We bow in submission before the mysterious ways of God.\n\nB) We entrust our lives to the God who cares for us.\n\nC) We place our confidence in God\u2019s ultimate purpose for us.\n\nBe encouraged, child of God. He has not brought us this far to cause us to fail. Those who read my words are in many different situations:\n\n* **Some are near to Christ\u2014even at the door of salvation.**\n* **Some are spiritually confused.**\n* **Some are going through hard times.**\n* **Some need encouragement.**\n* **Some are praying for a loved one to be saved.**\n* **Some face great difficulties in the days ahead.**\n* **Some have very serious health problems.**\n* **Some see no hope for the future.**\n* **Some are estranged from family and friends.**\n* **Some struggle with doubt and others with secret sins.**\n* **All of us stand in need of the grace of God.**\n\nMay I repeat what I just said: *He has not brought us this far to cause us to fail*. God ordains the means and the ends of life. He has but one end\u2014to make us like Jesus. He has many means to accomplish that holy purpose\u2014including some that are difficult to understand. But all of them come from the hand of the Lord. *A God who can bring something good out of betrayal can be trusted to accomplish his work in your life*. God is not finished with you yet, so don\u2019t give up on him. Amen."

If anything it could be looked at inherently selfish given the likelihood of your children taking care you as you grow old.\n\nSure, ultimately in the grand universal scheme of things, myself and my mother mean nothing. But the fact that I now feel an obligation to carry on a legacy tells me that in my relative frame of experience there is a meaning to that. It appears this \u201cmeaning\u201d people provide to the arbitrary is relative. But, it still exists. Which cannot be ignored. I truly am willing to put my own life at risk to ensure my family will be better off. Whether I created that meaning or the meaning was already there it doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\nThe endless distractions from death, I think we both will agree, is not necessary. We will all die one day and when MY time comes I can only hope I will go without fear and with dignity, much like my mother did.\n\nMemento mori\n\nEdit: I\u2019d also like to add, even though I can tell we have fundamental disagreements on human nature I still very much enjoy discussing this.",

I got my NVQ level 3, and a BTEC diploma level 3. Also got my 17th at the time.\n\nI moved away from home for work and did an additional 5 years pretty much working alone. It was very intensive and I liked it but didn\u2019t like the area nor the office politics.\n\nGot a job through the same company on a different role 2 years ago as I\u2019d be able to go back to my hometown. Last year I passed my 18th A2 and Inspection and Testing level 3 with flying colours.\n\nUnfortunately the office politics is even greater, I hate all the additional steps I must take to keep the company happy. A 5 minute job becomes a 30 minute job. There\u2019s little work as it is, a 1 in 3 standby which is painful, and overtime I\u2019m pretty much obligated to do due to the requirements of night works.\n\nI\u2019m chronically unhappy and need a change. Since getting my I+T I\u2019ve rewired my own new house and my brother\u2019s, also helped out a few mates with their own houses, new sockets, faulty lighting etc. Tested everything, all good. Overall it\u2019s hard work but I really enjoy it.\n\nI\u2019ve never worked self employed so I really don\u2019t know where to begin. I was wondering if some of you here could give me a few pointers on what I should do and need.\n\nEdit: I have a CSCS card, awaiting an ECS. I believe on it it says I\u2019m a highways electrician/maintenance electrician."

                "body": "#**Upscaling VNs in real-time and why and how you should do it \u2013 The Complete Guide**\n\nSo, I\u2019ve been experimenting with upscaling VNs in real-time for a while and the results looked rather promising. So here I am to share my results with the community.\n\n*Download link in the comments:*\n\n\n#Part 1: The Sales Pitch (you can skip this part)\n\nHave you ever used AI upscalers like Waifu2x for 2d art or DLSS for 3d games and went \"damn, wish I could do that in real-time for every VNs!\"? I know I have. Well, now you can! In real-time and at almost no performance impact. Thanks to the Magpie project (https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie/) and its dev\u2019s hard work to bring real-time AI quality upscaling to everyone with a single program. Now you can upscale almost every single VNs and programs in real time, bringing you high resolution and quality in VNs seen like never before! And it's very light too meaning you won't be needing a beefy rig just to run it.\n\nMagpie can take any modern application window as input and upscale it to full screen with minimal detail loss and blur. Which is perfect for upscaling VNs and anime like artworks. Not convinced yet? Take a look at the upscaling results since images are worth a thousand words. \n\n#Part 2: Upscaling Results \n\n* **Little Busters English Edition**    \nOriginal 720p: https://imgur.com/d44YvuW   \nUpscaled: https://imgsli.com/Nzg3NTY \n\n* **Muramasa**    \nOriginal (1024x576): https://imgur.com/cLKNMUT    \nUpscaled: https://imgsli.com/Nzg3NzM/\n\n* **Chaos;Head (Chaotic;Head)**    \nOriginal 800x600: https://imgur.com/pscXt9U   \nUpscaled: https://imgsli.com/Nzg3NTg/   \n\n* **Sengoku Rance**    \nOriginal 800x600: https://imgur.com/45CUSTX    \nUpscaled: https://imgsli.com/Nzg3NjY   \nOriginal 2: https://imgur.com/26OyiIv    \nUpscaled 2: https://imgsli.com/Nzg3Njg    \n\n* **Majikoi S**    \nOriginal 800x600: https://imgur.com/F7cE1cy    \nUpscaled: https://imgsli.com/Nzg3NzA\n\n* **Hoshi Ori Yume Mirai**    \nOriginal 720p: https://imgur.com/fRTG8YQ    \nUpscaled: https://imgsli.com/Nzg3NjQ\n\nAnd some others: \n\n* **Utawarerumono: Prelude to the Fallen 720p -> 1080p**: https://imgsli.com/Nzg3NTU \n\n* **Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai 720p -> 1080p**: https://imgsli.com/Nzg3NzQ\n\n* **Kinkoi 1080 -> 1440p**: https://imgsli.com/Nzg3NzY\n\n* And finally, some random upscaled shit that I did in the past with old version of some of these algos, mostly ACNet: https://imgur.com/a/lnBpL0q\n\n#Part 3: The How-to \n\n1. \tFirst things first, download the experimental build of Magpie (or build it yourself). (link in comments)\n\n2.\tStart magpie.exe. Keep it open either in the foreground or your system tray. Doesn\u2019t matter\n3.\tSelect a scaling mode of your liking\n4.\tGo to your VN window and click your Alt + F11 keys together to upscale that VN window to fullscreen. \n5.\tProfit. You now have crisp and clear fully upscaled VN running in your PC. \n\n**Some key points to remember before upscaling VNs**\n\n* The VN must be in windowed mode\n\n* Window size should be the same as VN resolution. Most VNs will start-up with its native resolution so you won\u2019t need to do anything. But there are some cases like Muramasa where it offers 1080p despite actually being in 576p. You\u2019ll know immediately if it\u2019s the actual proper resolution or not from the displayed quality. \n\n*Useful tips: If you have the habit of frequently alt-tabbing like me, I would recommend you to enable the [\u201cRestore full screen when source window loses focus\u201d](https://i.imgur.com/fiC160j.png). This will automatically restore your VN back to full screen when you get back to the VN window again.  \nYou may also set it to start at windows startup if you don\u2019t want to manually start it every time you want to read a VN.*\n\n\n# Part 4: Some tid-bits and some pointers:\n\nAlright, so you managed to upscale VNs in real-time! Yaay~! But what do these presets actually mean? Well here are some pointers for the curious, \n\n\n\n\nMethod | Description\n------|-----------\nACNet\u00a0 | ACNet is a CNN algorithm,implemented by\u00a0Anime4KCPP, it aims to provide both high-quality andhigh-performance. Gives a very clean and great looking image but getsrid of some minor details. Recommended for clean 2d surfaces\nAnime4k\u00a0 | Anime4Kv4 which has been recently ported to magpie_d3d branch, much better thanprevious anime4k shaders. Very high-quality upscaling results and preserves the details. Recommended for both clean and grainy surfaces.\u00a0\nFSRCNNXLineArt | A fast super resolution CNN algorithm. Despite having the word fast in it, it is quite heavy. Looks great for some VNs and bad at others. Produces ringing artifacts.\n\n\n\nOption | What it means\n------|-------------\nRCAS | Uses the CAS filter from FSR. Has a higher overall contrast and sharpness.\nDenoise | Anime4kspecific denoising upscaler. For noisy sources. Not recommended for VNs\nRestore | Anime4kspecific detail enhancement module. very sharp but produces ringing artifacts.\u00a0\nCatRom | Uses Catmull-Rom filter for downscaling instead of SSimDownscaler.Slightly blurry results but has better performance. Not recommended.\n\n\n\n**Recommended presets:** \n\nAs for the recommended presets, well go back to upscaling results and pick which one you like the best. And if you\u2019re still not sure which one to pick or do not have the time, well here are my recommendations:\n\n* Anime4k\n* ACNet (RCAS)\n* Anime4k (RCAS)\n\n***For advanced users:*** *You may configure the also upscaler presets and stack various effects on top of each other by editing the \"ScaleModels.json\" file from the magpie folder. The effects have the same name as the .hlsl files inside the /effects folder. You can also check the .hlsl files for possible parameters.*\n\n**F.A.Q.s:**\n\n1.\tQ: Can I upscale to non-fullscreen windows?    \nA: Unfortunately no. Right now magpie only supports upscaling to full-screen resolutions. \nYou can, however, edit the App.cpp file and specify a custom window resolution and position and build it to suit your needs.\n\n2.\tQ: Help! I have overlays like chiitransLite which doesn\u2019t work with this program.    \nA: For magpie to work properly, the window must remain always on top. So, it doesn\u2019t respect the alwaysOnTop property of other applications. So, overlays aren\u2019t really an option yet, unfortunately.  \n\n3.\tQ: Why should I use this application when Windowed mode already looks the best?    \nA: \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n\n#Epilogue \n\nCongratulations if you\u2019ve made it this far. Download the experimental VN specific build of magpie and get started (You can also build it yourself from the normal magpie/d3d branch but do note that it will not have the tweaked presets included). Startup your favourite 15-year-old VNs and enjoy it again in the glorious native resolution of your PC. With Just a simple press of **Alt+F11** keys of your PC."

It just needs to follow one or two characters on a simple but crazy journey with one objective that's outlined clearly 1/3rd through the first movie (cast the ring into the fire Frodo or \"steal the crystal and take it to the planet X to deactivate the hive minds and stop the zerg killing everything\") and they can stretch it out for as many movies as they like.",

Each movie could feature a different race as part of the main plot, but the same protagonists should be involved to knit it all together so even your grandma can understand the good guys vs the bad guys. They could form alliances with various groups in the other races like in the games so you get to see their worlds too.\n\nI really wanna see a Terran base survival vs the zerg and for them to make it like a zombie apocalypse.

                "body": "I've been living near but away from home since my much younger siblings were very small. But I feel guilty right now about distancing myself from family for my mental health as now that they're teenagers I think I need to be there for them.\n\nThe only time I lived with them was during covid lockdown where I became severely depressed due to the toxic environment from their dad who is very insecure and since 2020 started becoming defensive and aggressive to everyone. If/when their dad isn't around I'm like a cool parent figure and role model for them. I calm them down, we have fun, I show them things and improve their confidence and mindset. But when he is around he is toxic and sometimes verbally bullies my siblings which upsets me tremendously. But I'm too traumatised from my own childhood experiences with similar behavior to deal with the dad, who never listens to anyone and behaves selfishly and egotistically. I end up ruminating for days worrying about the impact it could have on them and how to prevent it. But even therapy has barely helped with this. The only way things get better for me is when I'm not around and distance myself.\n\nI did try to intervene in some heated situations but he continued to argue and not listen. Our mom won't leave him out of fear of being alone even though I've explained very thoroughly all the negative impact and how I can't be around the family anymore because of it, and she just shrugs or makes attempts to talk and fix it which ultimately don't change things.\n\nI'm an overachiever so still have a lot of things I want to achieve and focus on every day but in the back of my mind this worry that I should be doing more to help and be there for my siblings keeps returning which pulls me to pieces ruminating about how to deal with the toxic dad who is messing it all up as me wanting to abandon family is nothing to do with them.\n\nI still see them every few weeks but it requires coordination. One elderly family member lives there too and it's a similar story where I feel like they're happier when I'm around spending time with them but I cannot be around unless the step dad is gone.\n\nHealth and emotional damage can change very quickly. I just feel responsible for being there for everyone to prevent things going bad or to prevent mental health issues that for example could cause addiction issues later in life. Maybe I'm worried too much and it's not as bad as I imagine since my siblings have eachother, or maybe when they eventually move out everything will be fine.\n\nI don't know what to think or do but cannot imagine this continuing for years until that happens. It eats at me and stops me from thinking straight when I'm not even around."

                "body": "I graduated with a 2:2 physics bachelor's degree. Long story follows (tl;dr at end)\n\nAfter almost totally slacking off in my first year (did not count towards final grade) I thought I'd be able to still get the 2:1 I really wanted, especially because up until then I had good grades in previous academia via hard work.\n\nSo of course I tried extremely hard in my second year. But I really couldn't do it, I had social anxiety and probably some other anxieties that stopped me from being able to even focus on the work in front of me or truly pay attention to my lectures. I often sat for hours straight trying to understand a problem or learn some concepts, to no avail and to watch as my peers overtook me in less than half the time... My dedication paid off with decent coursework but terrible exam results because I was unable to remember or understand the material I was learning (in hindsight because I was constantly anxious and extremely emotional throughout the year). Ended up with a middle 2:2 in second year but still felt determined to pull it off in my final year.\n\nAfter a summer of reading various self help material (and about studying techniques) and learning to calm myself down into a more stable, happy pattern I approached my final year totally fresh and with a smarter approach. In the first semester I was rewarded with what seemed to be a much better understanding of what I was being taught because I was far more engaged, better coursework grades (2:1s/1sts) and even a small prize. Then second semester hit and about a quarter of the way through I was struck by an illness which lasted almost 2 months. The illness was horrible and affected my every waking moment. I'm beginning to cry just thinking about it again. I really should have dropped out and retaken the year but I was sick of the idea of forgoing my good efforts in the first term to risk losing all my momentum by taking a break. Of course this is where things turned downhill and despite denying it at the time I can look back now and see I receded into an anxious state yet again, forcing myself to keep going forward under the premise that the board of examiners would take my illness into consideration if things went wrong. The results this time were my worst ever (~3rds) and whilst I still got a 2:2 class degree I was absolutely gutted that my exams didn't go better, having felt so much more confident about the material in the first semester of my final year. \n\nMy wholehearted appeal to the board of examiners was utterly rejected but what's key is that they were so blunt, dismissive and unsupportive I might as well have been shot in the face. So my confidence has been utterly and truly destroyed, no employer would really want me for the technical jobs I'm interested in and it feels like my highly ambitious aspirations have been ripped apart.\n\nThe fields I am interested in pursuing a career in are technically/mathematically/algorithmically based in finance or programming. I don't trust myself anymore to be able to perform at a level that is necessary for these jobs. I'm so lost I just don't know what to do and whether to even bother. If I try to get these jobs will I just inevitably fail or possibly get fired...\n\ntl;dr\n\nDid well at school. Then I worked really hard but had difficulties (various anxieties) focusing at uni. Pretty much got over them in time for final year, felt like I was about to do well and then got ill. Ended up not getting what I was working extremely hard for. No sympathy at all from anyone. Want to go into technical job outside physics but have no confidence in my ability to do well. Overall I feel incredibly stupid for the effort I put in and don't even know whether I'm smart enough to do well in these technical jobs anymore. I can hardly remember more than half my degree as it is :("

If I experience or feel that the other isn't as in it as I am I will just distance myself. Or if they are too readily available I feel claustrophobic and back off. It's weird it's like I want to feel safe and close with someone but I'm afraid of it because I don't feel like I deserve it and at the same time it can also feel suffocating to get too much attention... I'm confused haha\n\nCan anyone who is either avoidant or anxious or both kind of describe their thought patterns and behaviors in relationships or while dating?\n\nAnother thing that feels weird is that I don't recall having a difficult childhood or that I didn't feel secure with my parents.. granted my dad was bad with conflict and had his moments where he'd blow up because he'd get frustrated but I felt safe around my parents for the most part. I had some bad sexual experiences but I think I already had my issues before that so I don't know where it stems from.."

I think people just love using this kind of language to diagnose literally everyone who shows a flaw as a narc or whatever. It's dumb. He could just be a little flawed. Not everything is manipulation or gaslighting. Makes me believe a lot of people here are projecting.\n\nMadlyn on the other hand was unhinged and entitled. That ladies night was crazy the way she behaved. The fact she told Randall she didn't care about Colby while trying to get him to shut him up so she could have sex with him. Leading herself to believe that every time Colby mentioned something he had an issue with, she's the victim and he doesn't accept her and whatnot. Her friends taking her side whatever she was saying. Those are signs i wouldn't want to be around someone like her. \n\nColby didn't show any signs to me that are alarming. He was respectful when rejecting Alexis (spare the comments that it was scary to see his change in demeanor, it was totally normal), he tried to grow and help April grow in their three weeks, spoke highly of Madlyn throughout everything, kissed a random girl at a club who he then texted with, owned up to that, but then gets completely demonized for explaining that it was a reaction to what he'd heard about her. How is that proof of any kind of narcissistic behavior? It could just mean he's jealous, or insecure, or a plethora of other things. \n\nWe have got to stop diagnosing everyone on the internet, that's what mental health professionals are for. We're too subjective and emotionally attached to remove ourselves enough from our past experience and not project.\n\n(Also fyi i feel like April and Colby were very alike and i see very little of the same hate happening against April)"

I have less of a sensitivity to the standard sensory stimuli (I'm a big hard rock/metal fan and love rock concerts and festivals and pubs for example), though crowds and certain noises can be triggering. \n\nI notice this sensitivity towards people's moods and energies even (or especially) through texts.\n\nExample: Rn i have this group chat with two others, we're trying to start up a podcast, and there's a couple contentions the other two are having regarding the name of the podcast and i just want to flee from all of this cause it makes me so uncomfortable. I just want peace and harmony yk. Literally the messages are making my heart race.\n\nAnd in person I've felt similar, like with my family when someone's stressed i kind of just feel all the stressed and then either leave or blow up or act in a way that isn't fun for them either. Like it's odd idk..\n\nI feel like i need super nurturing friendly loving environments to feel at ease. But it just isn't necessarily that i feel overwhelmed by sounds or smells or so. Does anyone relate to this lol or am I just actually not HSP and instead something entirely different haha"

In that situation, he still has the vault but it\u2019s money he is actively hoarding away, so while there are people loyal to Waterdeep wanting to stop him, he would be a major barrier as well and give it all a feeling of the government being against them. The final climax post-heist then would be working with a faction (or more) to confront and oust Dagult. \n\nI *think* the major change here would just be the end of the story and how the players relate to the City Watch, but any other feedback is also appreciated!"

Mechanically, his CHA is 11, but I think it just Wasn\u2019t Meant To Be. Instead, Milil (god of music etc) called him to be a cleric instead. I considered Magic Initiate for my original Feat, but because of backstory I wanted him to really have zero bard skills despite his years of training. Plus, Observant is nice. \n\nSo at Level 4 my debate is:\n\nA: ASI, max out my WIS and get that sweet sweet +5. This seems like the obvious choice as it helps with wisdom saving throws (+6 right now) attacks, spell saves, and a few skills that I use a lot\u2014Insight (+6), Perception (+4), and Passive Perception (19).\n\nB: Magic Initiate (Bard), picking up a few spells that don\u2019t rely on Charisma. Some combo of True Strike (which I can cast on the same turn as Spiritual Weapon), Minor Illusion, Message, etc. Less optimized but would make sense as a kind of pity prize from Milil, and I love cantrips, especially outside of combat. I was originally planning on nabbing this at Level 8, but a couple of measly cantrips and a Level 1 spell seems more fun at Level 4 than at Level 8. \n\nThoughts? Would I be crazy/screwing over my party to take the feat and waiting until L8 to max WIS? If I did do Magic Initiate, what spells would you take (our bard has Prestidigitation, Vicious Mockery, and Mage Hand)? Will I regret one or the other more?"

I have two GCC \u2014 one born in 2010 that\u2019s been with me through grad school, a marriage and divorce, and four moves \u2014 and one born in 2015 that my husband and I got to keep the first company when we started worrying about being gone all day for work. \n\nThe problem is that the second bird is a little different from my first: his parents (same parents for both birds) were a little more protective when he was a baby so he didn\u2019t get as much handling, and he\u2019s always been a bit more \u201cwild\u201d. The first year we had him, we were careful to spend solo time with each bird, etc, but in the end they bonded to each other and would get upset if we split them up. \n\nSince moving into our current apartment where they have more space to themselves (their cage is in an alcove near the kitchen), they\u2019ve became even more independent, and while they sometimes like to chill in the living room with us, they prefer roosting in the next room over and they definitely never cuddle anymore. We\u2019ve invested in all kinds of perches and toys and play gyms to encourage them to have a bird-friendly space near us but they\u2019d rather tear at the kitchen cabinets.\n\nI also got pregnant shortly after moving here, so during late pregnancy and the last year (baby just turned one!), it\u2019s been harder to be as diligent about cleaning up after them, etc. \n\nI miss cuddling my birds. And I really miss my husband feeling any kind of affection for them. He now just sees them as pests who make noise and make mess and thinks we need to rehome them, but they are happy and healthy and I know that rehomed parrots don\u2019t have a great chance of being happy and healthy. \n\nWhat can I do? I want to be a family that all gets along again, but the baby takes a lot of attention and she\u2019s not getting easier, and our apartment is too small to find a different home for their cage in the living room. I can try to clean their poops every day when they and the baby go to bed, but I don\u2019t think that would actually make my husband suddenly love them since he\u2019s also extra sensitive to noise and their beak destruction of everything other than toys we buy them. I don\u2019t want to lose them\u2014at least not the older one, but I don\u2019t think I can separate them either. \n\nHoping someone here can help!"

Some haven't stuck (such as Bruce), but I've started to like the idea of **a girl named Arthur**?  Probably helps that I'm writing a version of the King Arthur stories with a female Arthur, so I'm now accustomed to it on a girl.  I love Arthurian legend, and while **Morgan and Guinevere** are also on our list, the women in King Arthur are frequently portrayed as morally ambiguous (or tragic).  I'd love **Tristan** if it weren't now so trendy (though also a totally male knight's name, now trending for girls!).  The other \"boys'\" name that I'm considering is **Peregrine**.\n\nThe problem is my husband is a little unsure of the sound of the name itself.  With Andromeda, there are cute nicknames like Annie/Andie/Edie, but I'm not wild about Art or Artie.  So my questions are:\n\n1. Any nickname thoughts for a more feminine nickname, in case her personality seems to call for one?\n2. What would you expect from a girl named Arthur?\n3. Are there any girls' names that you think people would mistake it for?  Like, we thought if we named a girl Bruce and called her Brucie, everyone would just mishear it as Lucy.  My cousin Evan gets called Evie a lot, etc.\n4. What do you think of the combo Arthur Thalia S--?  (surname is one syllable, sort of like \"Stone\").\n5.

I thought it went like this:\n\n* First Act Turn: Orphan with latent magic skills is adopted by a kindly old man.\n* Pinch: Evil forces want to take orphan to be their own magician.  \n* Midpoint: Orphan learns that old man is a master wizard and becomes his apprentice. \n* Pinch: Evil sees they cannot steal orphan without revealing themselves, so they launch two attacks -- finding the orphan's family and pressuring the wizard to abandon the apprentice.  \n* Second Act Turn: Orphan's family returns, but he doesn't go back - orphan is sacrificing his desire for his family for his true purpose (originally, the family rejected him out of protectiveness, but I don't think that works as well?).\n* Third Act Momentum: Wizard's antagonists (not the story's protagonists exactly) attack him, causing the wizard to cut his apprentice off from magic. Orphan loses what he's worked toward, but is offered temptation to go back to his family.\n* Climax: Orphan realizes he was fired in effort to protect him; he uses magic learned to save wizard, prove himself, and become apprentice permanently.\n\nBut now I'm not sure if the wizard cutting the orphan off from magic should be the actual Act Turn? In which case the goodbye to his family would be... what, exactly? Should this get pushed back to the climactic choice to stay with the wizard for good?\n\nThe events can happen in this order regardless, but for pacing purposes I'm trying to understand which of these two events (saying goodbye to the family vs getting cut off from magic) is what the proper Third Plot Point / Second Act Turn should be.  I think I'm just too close to it to think properly.  Insight greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!"

I was already planning on telling my professional society that I could no longer attend conferences or travel out of town for events due to my medical situation, but after having a vertigo attack this Friday due to extreme stress from interactions with this society I am contemplating telling them that I need to resign from my role ASAP.\n\nI feel extremely guilty and like I\u2019m going to leave everyone in a bad place. Especially because I have had no luck over the course of the past year finding any fellow officers to help me. However, I can no longer live my life putting myself last. I feel that I need to simplify my life so that I can focus on my wellness. My job and my health are already stressful enough, I can\u2019t give away for free pieces of me that I don\u2019t even have anymore.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Am I being selfish? I am not sure what to say or how much information to give."

HOWEVER, (assuming you are considering teaching here), if you teach secondary school, you may be able to get a good job if the school is in a richer city, because in those cities the city hall sometimes adds to the teachers salary (or maybe hires them separately and not through the ministry of education, I'm not quite sure) so that might be something to consider, that is the path that my teacher (came from Australia) chose to take\n\n2.Healthcare is not bad at all. It is not that difficult to get an appointment for a general doctor but if you need a specialist it can take a lot of time to get to one, but you can try through a private doctor.\n\n3.Unless you are inside Tel Aviv it sucks. Much of Israel was built without very thought out planning (and you can't really blame anyone...) from my expirience bus lines get canceled, don't stop at the stop for no reason, etc without any notice. Trains are generally good and arrive on time, but most stations are not in central locations in the cities and you will most likely need another bus on top of the train to get to your destination... They are also now building some new rails so many stations are not fully functioning and some are shut down completely.\n\n4.Look, it depends on the area. I'm not quite sure what sort of chaos you are talking about, but in most areas most of us live a pretty chill life except for the occasional problems. I never lived in another country but I assume that life here is relatively chaotic but not something unbearable. \n\n5.Possibly. There are some schools that teach in English, especially if you are looking at the tlv region. But the teacher I talked about earlier doesn't know Hebrew that well either, and because she teaches English in high school it's fine.\n\n6.The housing market here is crazy, rent is high, prices are high, landlords generally will not hesitate to be assholes and in tlv especially. Even people who work great jobs struggle with buying an apartment, if you're willing to settle on somewhere that's a bit farther from tlv rent might be possible. But I can't lie and say that it's good, it's a big concern for many people here\n\nI hope my answers were helpful!!!",

And I really don't know what to do.) and I thought maybe some of you could relate and give me advice. \n\nTL;DR: A girl who's been manipulative to me for over a decade keeps sending me her conversations with my crush and lies to me about him. When I tell her her lies make no sense she ends the conversation. \n\nSo for context, I've known this girl for probably over a decade. We were friends in preschool and elementary school and she was always possessive, bossy and manipulative. She would never let me play with anyone else but had no problem playing with any other kids without me, and would refuse that we play together with someone else. When I decided to get new friends she would cry and tell the teacher me and my friend bullied her, this went on for years. In middle school I somehow found her back in my life, constantly trying to join my friend group and reporting me and the other friends to a teacher when she was unsuccessful. In the last year I found myself without any friends, so I started hanging out with her because she was also in a similar position and I figured she was the only person who won't reject me for sure. \n\nDespite the fact that I didn't really trust her, she somehow found out about a guy that I liked (A LOT). Two weeks later she slid into his DM's. And sent me screenshots. Of their conversations. And she kept saying that she thinks he's not into her (from the screenshots, he clearly is) so I tried acting like I don't care because I was pretty sure she was trying to get some sort of reaction from me, but you know, I was pretty upset. At some point I just asked her to stop sending me their conversations, and since I never texted her first we slowly stopped talking. \n\nThat is, until yesterday. She texted me to vent about someone she dislikes (keep in mind we haven't spoken for a good month and the person she was trashing on is a literal angel) The story was that her guy friend became really good friends with this girl and in her opinion she was turning him against her. I was angry so I said that it's ok because she has \\[guy that I like\\]. She said that she 'accidentally friendzoned him' and that he told her he likes someone else.  At that point I don't really know what kind of reaction she's trying to get from me.  I changed the subject, asked her about how she was doing in general, etc. I really didn't want to talk about him, but she started talking about him... again. She claimed that a few days ago he was looking for me and asked people about me (which is not true because i saw him and he definitely wasn't looking for me or anything of that sort). When I told her that it didn't really make any sense and that I can't believe that she quickly told me she has to go to bed and goodnight. \n\nIs she really the villan or is it me? Am I doing something wrong or playing the victim? Why do you think she's doing that? How do I deal with her? My friend advised me to cut her off completely for I know that if I do she will probably post stories of her crying and trash talk me to anyone who asks what's up with her (she already did this to the girl I mentioned.)"

I often hear the advice \"Write what you know\" and I really want to make the random passenger a relatable and realistic character, but...

                "body": "This post was inspired by Charlotte Reads' [2020 review presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ziqUSPXCb391n1z18Tz9CQgp1uhNk3NuLp0wBIhSYgg/edit#slide=id.g7e8f9914bd_0_77). Thank you, /u/enoby666\n\nThe purpose of this post is to share some of my personal thoughts about the subject and hopefully spark some interesting discussion.\n\nI also want to give some book recommendations and to hear yours. I\u2019m also linking some previous recommendation threads and discussions in case you want to dive into the topic further.\n\n**What is feminist SFF?**\n\nWell, first you have to determine what feminism is.\n\n- According to Wikipedia, feminism is \"is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes.\" Or genders. (My personal addition)\n\n- Feminism also acknowledges the difference between sex and gender. According to Wikipedia, \"gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, femininity and masculinity. These characteristics may include biological sex, sex-based social structures (i.e., gender roles), or gender identity.\n\n- \"Most cultures use a gender binary, having two genders (boys/men and girls/women), those who exist outside these groups fall under the umbrella term non-binary or genderqueer. Some societies have specific genders besides \"man\" and \"woman\", such as the hijras of South Asia; these are often referred to as third genders (and fourth genders, etc.).\" (Source: Wikipedia)\n\n- During the past few decades, intersectionality has become an important concept in feminism. It was coined in 1989 by Kimberle Crenshaw.\n\n- What it means is that in the Western society, there is the idea of a \"basic human being\". And often that person is thought to be a white, able, heterosexual, middle class man.\n\n- Someone who differs from that concept of a \u201cbasic human\u201d often faces bias and difficulties in their life. In the more ways they are different from the assumed norm, the more issues there are.\n\n- *Intersectional feminism* aims for equality between all people, regardless of gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexuality, abledness, neurodiversity etc. It is essentially the same as egalitarianism.\n\n- In this post I'm using the broader concept of intersectional feminism. You're welcomed to disagree with this choice. Please comment below and remember the subreddit rules. Be kind.\n\n---\n\n**What is an intersectional feminist SFF book like?**\n\nIt fits at least one of the criteria mentioned below:\n\n- It focuses on a female main character or characters, or features feministic themes (like equality struggles, parenthood, family relationships, everyday stories, female friendships, romance and sex etc).\n\n- It focuses on diverse characters who face bias and inequality.\n\n- It explores the concept of gender\n\n- It explores power dynamics in the society and/or in interpersonal relationships (the macro and micro level).\n\nIn my personal opinion, if a book categorizes genders as a binary, with female and male as the only options, it can\u2019t be 100% feminist, no matter its other merits. For example Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan holds such a gender essentialist view. In this world, gender is coded into your soul. Magic is divided by gender/soul. A male cannot channel saidar, a female cannot channel saidin.\n\n---\n\n**Some different ways how a book can be feminist**\n\n- The absolute minimum requirement: There are at least two female characters in the book and they talk to each other about something other than men (aka The Bechdel Test). (See /u/MikeOfThePalace \u2019s [analysis of some popular books](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/laais7/rfantasys_favorites_and_the_bechdel_test_by_the/) and whether they pass)\n\nNow, passing The Bechdel Test alone is hardly enough and the book needs to fill some other criteria too, such as:\n\n- The female/BIPOC/LGBTQ+/disabled characters are cool and awesome in some way that makes you relate (or not relate and that makes you to think)\n\n- It challenges the status quo of the society shown in the book\n\n- It challenges the views of the reader\n\n------\n\nI\u2019m listing some possible categories below, and share some book recommendations for each of them. \n\nI can\u2019t possibly include all the deserving representatives for each category. So I really hope that you all will shout out your recommendations and favourites.\n\nMy knowledge of sci fi is weaker than my fantasy fu so please help me out with sci fi recs especially. \n\nOne book might fit many different categories so please list all that apply.\n\nAlso, do let me know if you have opinions about the categories. Are there some that don\u2019t belong, some that should be added?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Girl / Person Power, f--- yeah**\n\nSmart people, characters with cool powers and who just plain kick ass.

                "body": "In the episode \"Progeny\" from SGA (season 3, episode 5) which I have recently re-watched, when the origin story of the Asurans is presented, it is mentioned that the Ancients included an aggression program within the Replicators' design that was meant to make them meet the Wraith with hostility and be willing to fight with them. The Ancients simultaneously prevented the Replicators from being able to alter/overwrite it, as they wanted to make sure they would fulfill their purpose of being a weapon. \n\nAt one point during the episode, Niam, one of the Asurans who wanted to ascend, asked McKay to remove the aggression program himself. But in order for his team to be able to escape from the Asurans' city, he first inserted a glitch in their network that would temporarily freeze them, and only made the necessary adjustments to Niam, which were supposed to be integrated by all of the Asurans at their next  'merge'. But that never happened, because they reset Niam beforehand when they realized he had betrayed them.\n\nAnd my question is... has SGA tried to eliminate that aggression program ever again? They seemed to have had to opportunity to do that at least that time when McKay activated the Asurans' command directive to attack the Wraith in \"Lifeline\". Maybe if he had chosen to leave that directive dormant as it had been until that point and overwritten the aggression program instead, the Asurans would have reconsidered their situation and would have stopped being as violent, even though it is true that they had their reasons to treat SGA as enemies, since they were the ones who had blown up their city first. Still, I feel like if that had happened, the Asurans would have become more peaceful towards the world in general and more willing to cooperate with those who needed their assistance. Or am I overestimating these machines that have caused nothing but harm throughout almost all of the series' seasons?\n\nHowever, it still feels morally wrong that SGA decided to use the second chance they had to access the Asurans' network in their apparent favor by 'helping' them make the final step in becoming the weapon they were created to be, a purpose that they so greatly despised, knowing the Replicators had begged the Ancients to remove the program that was making them feel so spiteful.

Nor Greenshade, but the issue with that one isn't so much the story itself than the fact that I care negatively about The Green, so my highlight was that one \"Sinner\" you speak to with Indaenir who was completely unrepentant.\n\nRiften was underwhelming, but Shadowfen was worse, imo. \n\nRivenspire was imo actually the best of the DC zones -- the first two were mostly boring, the prologue was meh compared to the EP and AD one, Alik'r was pretty but not all that engaging... Bangkorai was nice too, but since I don't RP my DC champion as the Vestige (that goes to my AD character), all the references to the main story were more of an issue to me. Really nice if you don't have that problem, I imagine.\n\nI'm gonna go against the grain and say I quite enjoyed Blackwood. I had more of an issue with Elsweyr, because I found the new characters in it super boring -- I only warmed to Khamira in the epilogue. During the actual chapter it was \"Ah yes, me, my buddy Abnur... and those annoying other schmucks. Shut up already, Khamira.\" \n\nAlso not that into High Isle, which I'm doing right now... Ayrenn and Emeric coming back? Amazing! Love you guys! Za'ji and Caska too. But Jakarn? Was annoying in the base game. Irnskar? Didn't care for you before, don't care now. Arabelle? Hooray for yet another character we're told is Great and So Competent, but not shown. Why is she here? What does she add? Why do I bother with her? Idk man. \n\nGenuinely don't know which one is my least fave, though lack of Ayrenn in Summerset aside, my fave is probably the entire Daedric triad arc. Which also had the advantage of not needing to fit into the year long story formula. Now if they fix main character integration by acknowledging who you are more...

I suspect a lot of people with that problem are on the more introverted side, with some of them likely also suffering from some measure of social anxiety, so the cost to benefits ratio doesn't seem worth it.\n\nDespite this, I find there are MMOs that can still work for people who find social interactions more stressful, ESO being one of them. You have a lot of control over when you go into the more social parts without being forced to, it's actually nice to see other people around even if you don't interact, you have the economy game which just isn't there in SP games... I have pretty severe social anxiety, for example, and the latter is one of my favourite parts, enough so that it's what made me join guilds. Back in SWTOR I even had spread sheets, in ESO you don't need that as much since Addons do a lot of the data stuff for you.\n\nMeanwhile, despite having thousands of hours in the game, I've done one whole DLC dungeon and maybe... 5 vet base game dungeons? (For all that people bitch about the PVP community, I've actually run into some very kind people there. Dungeons seem to be a lot more hit and miss for me, hence my apprehension there.)",

Akatosh being able to send that much power is interesting! Why does he have an easier time than Meridia for example? Is it the ritual? Is it easier for an Aedra to channel power into Oblivion than for Princes to invade each other? Is he, as suggested upthread, also drawing on surrounding Aetherial power? etc.\n\nTbh I also don't see how Bal's access to Nirn changes anything?

I never read that). But apparently in four years, Walter never once thought \"oh man maybe we should check out Aurora ourselves and find out what happened\". What he does somehow think of is some harebrained scheme to ask for help in their \"revolution\" from the Aurorans when he knows literally nothing about the place other than that it fucked Logan up good.\n\nAnd surprise!

And Walter's precious protege, who may have already done things that make Logan look nice in comparison (like the Dark Sanctum) can easily rule the same way their brother did with not a peep from Walter now that everyone knows what is at stake, making his entire insistence on a \"revolution\" a fool's errand.\n\nAlso he keeps referring to a simple coup d'etat as a revolution and it is driving me *insane*.\n\nDespite apparently having planned this for years (instead of, you know, taking his oaths to his King seriously and trying to figure out what happened before turning traitor) the Prince/ss is also woefully underprepared for this whole coup thing at the start of the game, on top of everything else.\n\nIf it wasn't really obvious Lionhead meant him to be a likable mentor and father figure who genuinely cares about the Hero and wants to do the right thing, I'd almost say his affable persona is all an act and he really just wanted his protege on the throne instead of the older and more independent sibling.\n\n(And lastly, cause I just played through the prologue again: lmfao at him saying signing the petition should show your brother you have a mind of your own when you only did it cause Walter put you on the spot and didn't even read it first, and at him saying \"I don't think they know what your brother is capable of\" when Elise shows you the mob waving around signs calling for Logan's death cause... Walter my guy, if they don't know the punishment for treason tends to be death, then I really don't know what to say.)"

(And that whole passage is weird tbh because at first it sounds like Alessia is given the diamond which then unfolds into Pelinal, then it reads like Pelinal just kind of showed up at the camp covered in blood and boasting about having killed their eastern chieftains.)\n\n(...Though admittedly if he's a Cyborg that begs the question of whether he became one willingly or not, so that has the potential to be horrifying too :|)"

I know anything I chose would be specific to my place in the world and would not represent all of humanity, but I think that\u2019s true of everyone, and it\u2019s fun to think about anyway. Which album would you choose if you had to?\n\nI think it should be something that both shows the goodness of humanity, and also has some sort of cultural significance. This is why I\u2019d choose either Pure Heroine or Melodrama by Lorde. Honestly, I think these albums really encapsulate what it\u2019s like to be a teenager in the 2010s, so I think they could be a good representation of my generation. Plus they cover themes like: growing up, teenage relationships, social status, love, heartbreak, materialism, insecurity, and nearly everything about modern teenage culture. I just can\u2019t imagine those aliens listening to Ribs or Writer In The Dark and still deciding that humans are worthless.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"

In university I took a beginner German class, and I\u2019ve been considering being an au pair in Germany. I\u2019m from Canada by the way.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m not sure if I would make a good au pair. I\u2019m young, I\u2019ve never travelled anywhere before, and I\u2019m not very independent. I\u2019m not sure if I would be able to function by myself in a different country, and would probably lean on the host family for support. But is that normal for young au pairs? I\u2019ve heard some host families support their au pairs like they\u2019re part of the family, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be a burden on them. Also, I have almost no experience with kids. I like them, but I\u2019m pretty non-confrontational and shy, so I would probably struggle, especially with discipline.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m also polite and I really would try my best. I also know the responsibilities of an au pair. I like cleaning and doing housework. I\u2019m not interested in it just because it\u2019s a cheap way to travel, I also want to learn. I really think it would be a chance for me to become more independent and learn about taking care of kids. \n\nBut am I just not cut out for it? Would any host families want me as their au pair? Thanks for taking the time to read my ramblings, any advice from au pairs or host families is appreciated."

                "body": "This is going to be a very long post so buckle up! \n\nI started therapy again around October with a new therapist because of moving. The  therapy started it wasn't going very smooth. My therapist often comes late, forgets things I tell him, rarely takes notes, yawns during sessions, the list goes on. These are all the minor things. \n\nMy biggest issue with his therapy are the following:\n1. The lack of structure and clear goals in the therapy.\n2. The fact that he can only squeeze me in irregularly which means one session about every third week.\n\nI found it difficult due to my struggles with conflict, but I managed to express these difficulties to him one session. He then told me he still couldn't do more sessions. Further he told me me that he felt we had a good system about how we were doing the therapy and that there wouldn't be a need for changes. \n\nAppointments go by and I keep expressing these two problems and that it's hindering my advancement in therapy. I also went as far as to ask him if he could refer me to someone else who at least had more appointments. He declined with saying everywhere else were also overbooked. This felt like another defeat.\n\nAt the moment I receive financial support through gov benefits. This requires that I do a few meetings with the welfare office from time to time. This is generally not a problem for me. I even quite like the counselor there (or used to) and have told her some of the basics of what I struggle with because I trusted her. She even offered sending my therapist a letter requesting them to more thoroughly follow up on my therapy so that I get the treatment I need. Great I thought!  Sadly this where things are starting to turn more.\n\nDuring a session my therapist tells me he received her letter. He then goes to rant about how he can refer me to things like activity centers and workout groups. I politely tell him that I need more therapy, not exercise. This didn't go through to him. \n\nA few weeks after I'm having another appointment with my welfare counselor. She begins by saying she got a reply from my psychologist. Then she starts reading parts of his letter out loud. It contained so much sensitive information. Things like my exact diagnoses, troubles I had taken up during a doctors appointment, my psychological evaluation. It even brought that I sometimes use cannabis to self treat my anxiety. The latter she even started criticizing me about with her own opinions. I was in shock.\n\nDuring the next session I ask my therapist how my counselor could've gotten so much information and tell him about how it troubled me. His only reply was that he did not send any personal info about me.\n\nAt this point I had no idea how my counselor got all this information to begin with. I thought that she only sent a letter to request me get more therapy. Turns out she also requested a doctor's notice. Usually doctor notices stick to only relevant information, what happened here is the opposite. I dug through my patient's journal to find the letter my welfare counselor had received and it was signed in my therapist's name. This proves he literally lied to me about \"not sending out personal information\". \n\nThis set me back so much. I've fought my best these months as to get the help I need but I feel like I'm constantly met with resistance from the very people supposed to help me. I'm starting to regret even applying to therapy because of this. I feel like there is just so much more harm than good coming out from this and above all I'm tired of not getting taken seriously. I just want help dealing with my avpd.\n\nI mostly wrote this for myself but if anyone actually reads this then I thank you for taking the time to do so!\n\nTL;DR: \nNot receiving good enough therapy. Welfare counselor sent a letter to request that therapist take me more seriously. Letter asks therapist for doctor's notice without my knowledge. My therapist sends counselor this without my consent containing highly irrelevant and sensitive information about me."

On top of this the very thought of even being able to create life scares the shit out of me, because I know so deep down this is something I feel is so wrong for me. Having been over two years in therapy and now having started with a new psychologist (due to moving) I thought I'd take the opportunity to open myself up more about my values and also discuss my wish for a vasectomy. \n\n**Some background info:** in my country there is an age limit of 25 to get a vasectomy, but there are exceptions that can be made by doctors/health professionals to people who have health reasons as to why they should have one earlier. Although those are quire strict.\n\n**Anyway, to continue;** my psychologist seemed to not understand the concept of antinatalism at all and after I shared my views he would go on about how \"life is a gift\" and how beautiful the process of sharing our world with children is. Naturally I got upset about him not even trying to see things fromy point of view. I even tried telling him my concerns about if I were to have an accident and the other person wouldn't be able to go through an abortion because that would literally break me. I don't think I could knowingly continue living knowing I had brought life into this shitty world and well, I told him this. But as you can imagine he still wouldn't listen and told me to do this through a doctor instead which well, I did as of today. My doctor used the same argument as my psychologist did which I think is quote dumb and that's the classic; \"what if you'll regret your decision\". I can't even start to count how many counter arguments I tried to give them but they just won't listen and even admit to not understand. I'm just so tired of feeling like I'm not allowed to have authority and control over my own body. There are people who do lots of other irreversible surgeries that's legal far below the age of 25, but my personal choice of not wanting children just won't be accepted and I can't for the life of me understand why. \n\n**TL;DR:** Tried getting a vasectomy approved at soon to be 23y/o, but both my psycholost and my doctor refuse to approve it due to their natalist values."

But chef Anne seemed to take offense to it, rode Tessica hard for it, and then Tessica was gone. Could chef Anne have misinterpreted the phrase, could she have thought it was used as a pejorative, did she feel Tessica should never put herself on the same standing as chef Anne, or that by using \"baby girl,\" did chef Anne think Tessica was being condescending?"

It has stainless steel cladding and a (I think) a carbon core. The previous owner must have pretended he was Gordon Ramsey and try high-speed honing, but not only did he fail, but it looks like he used an industrial diamond sharpening stick and not a honing rod. And it looks like he was drunk when the did it. Both sides of the blade were scratched from tip to heel. I managed to get most of the knife to a rough mirrored finish with a 3000 and 5500 grit stone, but the blade is not a perfect plane--there are some concave parts of the blade that the stones don't make contact with, thus leaving the scratches.\n\nI also have a carbon steel Messermeister chef's knife that I got dirt cheap because the kitchen boutique store had put stickers on it, and they stained the metal. I figured polishing that blade would also remove the stained spots, but closer inspection revealed that the blade still has scratch marks from the 5500 stone.\n\nSo my plan is to get a strop without a backing, and a spray/paste and just work the cleaver by hand, and then use the strop with backing on the chef's knife. Does that seem like a good plan, and if so, what micron level should I use? Please note, I'm really just doing this for fun, and I don't need the exquisite, mirrored finish you sometimes see in here."

It was time for 5th, and when i was about to press the clutch, i realized that it was gone. It was all the way down, but my 4th gear was still engaged. I shifted to neutral without the clutch, (thought that my transmission was gone), and thats when i started hearing a sound like a leaking hose. 2-3 seconds forward, and my car started smoking. I started to slow down. Another 5 seconds later, and i hear a loud boof. My hood was on fire, and the gearstick was moving freely in my hand. No gears, nothing. I got out of the car and leaned to see what's happening. I could see fire under the hood, and I thought that its better to call the fire department, rather than open the hood, because the car had LPG.\n\nWhat might've caused that to happen? The clutch is brand new, the transmission oil and engine oil is also brand new. The LPG system has certificate of serviceability. I suspect that it was a hose that leaked oil on top or near the engine, which set it on fire."

                "body": "I really don\u2019t feel like making this sound entertaining but it\u2019s almost like that one episode in Modern Love. I have bipolar III, also called cyclothymia, also called a mild mood disorder. I didn\u2019t know until last year when I finally decided to get evaluated. I\u2019m told my self-awareness has helped me tremendously because it could\u2019ve become full blown bipolar disorder. I just wish I knew sooner but whatevs, now we\u2019re here. A part of me doesn\u2019t agree with the way mental health is angled and diagnosed and treated, and I know we\u2019re all a bit mad, but I always knew I could afford to have more emotional stability than I did growing up. Life was extra hard. The ups and downs were def more marked when I was younger. I threw fits and tantrums and then I\u2019d be skipping around. I knew I felt things more intensely than like, everyone I knew, the good and bad. It\u2019s done me a lot of good in my life, but also a lot of bad. My attendance record at school and with jobs has been strained due to my fluctuating moods. Partners have called me intense and unpredictable. They didn\u2019t know cuz I didn\u2019t tell them because I didn\u2019t know. Despite having no treatment and white knuckling it my whole life, I\u2019ve done pretty well for myself. I\u2019m very resilient and have other strengths. Anyway, I\u2019m worried. I don\u2019t have a problem attracting men, I\u2019m thinking about the long haul stuff here. I have no plan other than... I\u2019m hoping I could move forward with a new awareness of myself that might help my next guy get me better? I\u2019m fine on my own but I don\u2019t want to live and die just fine or alone. But I\u2019m really confused about how to enter into a relationship with it now when it\u2019s definitely been a problem before. At what point do I share it? I\u2019m afraid to try again, I don\u2019t want to be rejected for being difficult or damaged etc. It sounds like something easy to accept but... is it really? What guy would want to sign up for a partially unreliable, moody gf/fianc\u00e9/wife? The thing with me is, my guy has to be someone naturally emotionally stable because that has a stabilizing effect on me. It\u2019s the healthiest kind of partner for me and it\u2019s what I\u2019m attracted to. But if/when things fall apart, I\u2019m screwed. Breakups are disastrous for me. I\u2019ve survived 2 big ones and I just can\u2019t do more. The adjustments are brutal. So I don\u2019t date now cuz I don\u2019t like the risk. But I\u2019m lonely sometimes. I wish I had something else, like a problem that wasn\u2019t in my head/heart... like eczema. Or a gluten allergy. Or couldn\u2019t read lol. I feel like men would have an easier time teaching a woman to read than attempting to flow with her mental shit. I kind of feel like I\u2019m in a dead end situation. So.... SUPER fun ad, I know, but I would really appreciate feedback."

In my test code, I sent the message \"s1000e\" infinite times but what I get is generally combination of the characters in my message. \n\nI checked the AT settings and cqapacitor. I have seen some schemes were including a diode  connection in the circuit which I did not check whether it is the reason or not since I don't have any. I have read about the radio modules as well and aparted my modules. When the distance was much, it was not sending any data. When they were close, the problem occurs again. There is no middle way.\n\nSo, where do you think the problem is?"

Not your standard \"I want you, you want me, let's do this\" sex, this is downright animalistic fucking. Fast, slow, vigorous, violent. Each sensation intensified five-fold. We're inventing positions beyond the kama sutra, fucking at every conceivable angle to find the best ones. We are energizer bunnies running on unadulterated carnal lust, an unstoppable desire to push every limit of pleasure. This is what porn wishes it looked like.\n\nAt midnight, we're both still horny as hell but I'm exhausted. She on the other hand has more energy now than when we started (this must be how succubus legends started) and spends the better part of the hour riding me. We go down on each other every once in a while for intermission.\n\n1am, my orgasm is nowhere in sight, which is great because neither of us want to stop. We do slow down the rhythm and switch positions more frequently. Short break to smoke some more and change the 5-6 porno movies we have playing on loop.\n\n2am, we are so dehydrated that we need to take an extended pause to chug several cups of water each. We've already passed our previous time record, but we're just getting started. Everything is so goddamn sexy. She is so fucking hot, I'm so fucking hot, we're just wild beasts succumbing to our deepest nature. Our passion is an unstoppable force. We just want to feel each other, as deep and intensely as possible.\n\n3am, she's no longer getting wet but we both want to keep going, so we chug more water and get the lube out. We go down on each other for about half an hour, slowly and oh so deliciously. She tastes better than she's ever tasted before and I can't get enough of her, 69 has never been so fun. We're trying out new things that we've never done before. Any inhibitions about sex we've ever had in our lives are gone. There is literally nothing we could do right now that would turn the other person off. We take advantage of this to ask each other to do things we're usually too ashamed to ask for. We talk dirty like never before. Licking assholes, smacking each other, throwing her around the room, you fucking sexy slut this, give me your fucking dick that... It's all so goddamn intense.\n\n4am, I can't even keep it up anymore. She goes down on me but it's no use - my body is utterly depleted. I'm angry at myself because I don't want to ever stop having this kind of sex, she tells me not to push myself too much. We cuddle for half an hour, softly massaging each other's genitals with lube. The gentleness is a welcome change of pace for both of us and eventually I get it up again and slide back inside her, but now I'm alternating between hard and soft, all the while desperately willing my penis towards the former.\n\n5am, we are so tired. We haven't eaten in 12 hours and I haven't done this much exercise in years. I'm not even inside her most the time anymore, we're just rubbing each other and telling the other how turned on we are, how much we love each other, how hot this is, while our eyes are glued to the monitor that's playing 6 porn movies simultaneously. We compare notes about which movies are our favorites, and it's the sexiest conversation ever. We smoke a little bit more.\n\n6am, it's on again. Our second (or maybe 4th/5th) wind is here and we're back at it full force. We've gone totally numb to the porn now, there's been so much of it, so we turn it off, which strangely enough gets us more excited.\n\n7am, we decide to record this on video because this is going to look amazing, but sadly we've missed most of the best stuff and now it's a mix of me slowthrusting and her trying to keep me hard with her mouth, with the occasional scene of enthusiastic passion. I spend more time watching the live recording than looking at her... I stop filming after 45 minutes so I won't be distracted anymore. A bit more good and vigorous fucking.\n\n8am, we can't go on. I can't go on. The passion is still every bit there, but the flesh is weak, so so weak. I am utterly and entirely done. I still haven't come because of the meth, but there is literally zero energy left in my body. Every reserve has been tapped, just holding my body upright seems like a herculean task. She insists on finishing me off with her mouth. God bless her loving heart.\n\n8:30, after a half hour blowjob, and nine hours of semi-continuous fucking, I finally come. It's like a volcanic eruption, I almost black out from the release. I collapse hard, immobilized for a good twenty minutes. My penis is so raw that the slightest touch is unbearably painful. Of course I can't sleep, because, the meth, but we both feel so amazing (and exhausted). There is lube and other fluids all over the place, but we don't care. After a rest (and a huge spliff to ease the comedown) we pull ourselves up and go get some breakfast, which we have to force ourselves to eat.  \nIt would be 36 hours before I got another erection."

It's literally as you said, the expected reaction to a threat to the relationship is \"how dare she try to steal MY man etc\" there is anger and the blame is on the other. But her reaction is \"well maybe he would be better off with her because I have so and so faults\" there's sadness because in her eyes the blame is on herself. She thinks she isn't enough and you could have better and she's taking that away from you. I really feel for her because this reaction hurts more than the former one and it stems from low self esteem that runs deep andhas grown over many years. Carry on with the words of affirmation that really helps but it needs to be more than just \"you're enough for me\". You need to make her feel like she's perfect for you. When complimenting her be very specific. Eg if I'm told \"you're funny/ pretty\" I'd brush it off thinking they're just being nice. If they said \"you're so funny remember yesterday when you say ... That made me laugh so much... You always make these unique jokes about... which is why I leave our conversations smiling\" or \"I think you're so pretty because I love the shape of your eyes and the way that ....\" If you can bring examples or any objective proof as well like \"even my mum thinks your super nice she mentioned how appreciative she was that you did ... Last week\" or \" everyone knows you're smart since you achieved ...\" Do you see what I mean? Ultimately you need to speak from the heart though because she will know if you don't mean it and describe in detail WHY you think she's enough so she understands and believes you. While this can help a lot, it's not a cure for low self esteem. That has to come from her and from within. Therapy can help, but if she doesn't want to do that other things I've found useful was \"feeling good\" the CBT self help guide as well as journalling to keep track of what thoughts upset me and then later analyse these thoughts and challenging them or keeping a list of traits she values in her self and reminding herself of them often",

With the pregnancy and breast feeding won't I have to go over a year without the treatment at one point (or even multiple times if i have multiple kids) \n\nI know it's in the very distant future but this makes me scared to try minoxidil.

Vo dar um conselho pra ti: n\u00e3o seja burro\n\nvoc\u00ea vai se mudar? \u00f3timo, eu tbm me mudaria mesmo que a medida protetiva sa\u00edsse 48h depois de registrar o B.O.\n\nJ\u00e1 que vai se mudar, pelo amor de Deus se beneficie da vantagem de o cara n\u00e3o saber mais o seu endere\u00e7o e tire dele a chance de ele saber. E que chance seria essa? provavelmente voc\u00ea teria que informar novo domic\u00edlio nos autos do processo, documentos que o advogado dele teria acesso. Fora que numa audi\u00eancia que tu compare\u00e7a no f\u00f3rum ele poderia te seguir para a nova casa, etc.\n\nO melhor que tu faz \u00e9 desistir dessa porra enquanto d\u00e1 tempo, sua advogada parece n\u00e3o estar fazendo um bom trabalho pq 8 meses sob amea\u00e7a de morte e nada ainda? ou ser\u00e1 que o tal vizinho tem um parente, um amigo influente dentro do sistema que est\u00e1 abafando o neg\u00f3cio?\n\nNa melhor das hip\u00f3teses, que seria esse merda perder o emprego, a\u00ed voc\u00ea ia pagar sozinho o pre\u00e7o de ser o causador disso. Pode ter certeza que ele ama esse empreguinho de merda dele s\u00f3 por proporcionar essa possibilidade de ele ser um bully com os outros.\n\nEu e toda a sociedade nos beneficiar\u00edamos com um cara desse perdendo a farda. Mas voc\u00ea sozinho vai pagar? fora que quando voc\u00ea se mudar, ele nem vai mais lembrar de voc\u00ea pq o que ele fez com vc ele deve fazer uma vez por m\u00eas com outros ao redor dele.\n\nE sobre o papo de imigrar, se vc tem a possibilidade ent\u00e3o mete o p\u00e9 cara. Nem que seja pra voltar depois mas com uma experi\u00eancia nova, uma viv\u00eancia que muitos querem mas n\u00e3o podem ter",

So I've got just a quick question to ask the autistic community, hope it's not against the rules.\n\n**For relationships, would you prefer someone who is or isn't on the spectrum, and why?**\n\nI'm curious if the answer will vary based on gender especially, like maybe autistic girls would be more willing to date a neurotypical than autistic guys. But IDK if that's actually true.\n\n(Full disclosure, I don't like using \"neurotypical\" to mean \"not autistic\" because it minimizes the fact that everyone's brain is different. I may not meet enough criteria for autism now but have never felt \"neurotypical\" at any point in my life)"

                "body": "I\u2019d been watching some true crime docs on Netflix and decided to cross over to a scripted series. *Mindhunter* looked interesting, so I began watching the first episode. Big mistake.\n\nThe episode starts out fine, the main protagonist was single, which kind of surprised me. But of course, you can probably guess what they were setting up. Yep, the rest of the episode focuses around some girl he met at a bar. It immediately struck me - the ease of which he charmed her with his pickup lines, status, and good looks, despite being a little bit socially awkward in her world. And it got me thinking about how I\u2019d never find myself in a situation like this. I had to stop watching about halfway through the episode. I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \n\nIf you\u2019re single with a sad empty apartment like the guy in the series, there\u2019s something wrong with you. If you can\u2019t walk into a bar and walk out with some random girl like the guy in the series, there\u2019s something wrong with you. We see this over and over again in the media. Almost every scripted series I\u2019ve seen focuses on some kind of relationship dynamic. *The Big Bang Theory* is a great example of a show where the ultimate goal is to ensure the protagonists don\u2019t remain single and forever alone by the end of the series. These dysfunctional guys *must* be paired up, or the show will end as a failure!\n\nMy hope is that someday FA, shy, unattractive men will be represented in the media, not as broken or sad people that need to be paired up ASAP, but rather as people with unique strengths that transcend being single or in a relationship. In the meantime, I think the best option is simply to avoid watching a scripted series, or at the very least do your research and know what you\u2019re getting into. The last thing I want to see is more FAs taking their own life or slipping into a state of despair and being too depressed to function because of constantly being labeled as broken.\n\nIf there\u2019s one takeaway from this post I want everyone on the sub to have, it\u2019s that being FA doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re broken, even if the media representation of FA is."

(Luckily lol)\n\nThe thing is something has been happening since some months ago and I\u2019m getting kind of scared.\n\nLately I\u2019ve been watching strange silhouettes with my peripheral vision. They are strange not because they have weird shapes, but because for a second I actually register and feel as if someone is standing close to me, but there isn\u2019t. At first I thought it was nothing, you know, sometimes you think you saw something but you didn\u2019t, it\u2019s not that deep, right? The thing is: this is happening way too often now. It used to happen maybe once or twice a week, but now almost everyday I feel and \u201csee\u201d like someone is standing close enough for my peripheral vision to register, but when I actually look there\u2019s no one. \n\nIt gets creepy when I have to go for a glass of water late at night and istg someone was at my side. But it wasn\u2019t. So, yeah, does anyone has this issue too? Should I get my eyes checked? Or should I just try to not think too much about and let it be until it stops?"

Idk why but I always liked that spot, from there I could easily watch the moon and starts when the night was clear. \n\nWhile I was drawing suddenly I felt like that \u201cbreeze\u201d you get when someone runs besides you, but it was a like a really fast feeling, I couldn\u2019t even process it when I heard someone whispering something to my ear. I didn\u2019t understand what, but I remember that moment so clearly is almost weird. My mom was taking a shower, I remember because I felt so confused after that I tried to explain what just happened however I could. What I heard was not my mother.\n\nI tried to recreate the moment so many times. I really wanted to know what \u201cthat\u201d whispered to me. It didn\u2019t work. \n\nSome years later (I was 15 yo), I had already forgotten about this experience, it was nothing but a curious story to tell whenever I remembered it had happened. The point is that my room was getting painted and of course I wanted to help. I was painting on -that- spot, not even thinking about my past experience when everything happened again. The fast breeze besides me and I heard someone whispering to my ear. And again I couldn\u2019t understand it. The exact same feeling, the exact same spot, the exact same voice but years later. It seems like this thing only happens when I have already stopped thinking about it. I still want to know what is \u201cthat\u201d telling me. I\u2019m waiting for it to happen again since (I\u2019m 19 yo). \n\nHas somebody ever experienced something like this?"

Notice how there is still tons of room for cars to roam around, and there is ample room for delivery trucks to get in/out of the shops of Canmore:\n\n[Slide 1](https://preview.redd.it/d1j1u0glhjea1.png?width=1180&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6db907afcc1e07620e617c7c0d2bb44220106634)\n\n[Slide 2](https://preview.redd.it/affqd1glhjea1.png?width=1180&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=db3ab76757299705907553b8cf8599ed7299e29a)\n\nBelow is a preview of what the proposed changes will (sort of) look like. The intersection on Benchlands Trail and Bow Valley Trail got upgraded several years ago along with the red/gray pedestrian and cycle infrastructure: \n\n[The red\\/gray areas of the proposed plan slides will look like this.](https://preview.redd.it/zs511m3pjjea1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc4ae386f66be89f39e44a3fd676f80f260bf085)\n\nAnd below is what exists on Railway Avenue. Which in some sense, is a stroad. This area can get tricky to navigate as many tourists come into downtown Canmore through this way along with workers on foot or bike:\n\n[Notice the narrow sidewalks on both sides. In the summer, these walkways get packed with people, baby strollers and cyclists.](https://preview.redd.it/uouh4ca0ijea1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=98fc7993b15f2342c25c4a6eedac4eadcbc8620c)\n\n[Some parts are alright, but during the winter this area turns into a mess.](https://preview.redd.it/gti97xa0ijea1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c0e787042f95fb67b3bcddae1f8485c27f0fada7)\n\n[I work at a grocery store that's located on this arterial way, and yes it does get clogged with traffic.](https://preview.redd.it/7zhdiza0ijea1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=28123c22d931ddd143d2dda109e5c85917a76ae9)\n\nI knew as soon as these proposed plans got released online a while back that there would be backlash from a certain group of residents in this town of 14,000 people. And boy did they come out:\n\n[But not just old people, and I see lots of old people walking along the roads in both the summer\\/winter months too.](https://preview.redd.it/jkoeffu0kjea1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ec38344381211defe93da2f72bfc5c505f3f4fb8)\n\n[This shit show known as the Facebook comments section. There are some voices of reason too!](https://preview.redd.it/y3vzjgu0kjea1.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9edaba64b366b33ecaef2490e61a7e37138f8839)\n\nOverall, it's quite cringe worthy too see such comments coming out. I think the underlying problem people have is that they feel that their way of life and convenience is somehow \"threatened\" by the proposed upcoming plans. The plans still show lots of space for cars though.\n\n**Now, I would like to request some help, in particular in locating studies that \"pedestrian friendly benefit\" like this person below is asking for?** I am currently trying to locate studies at the moment so that I can pull them up when need be in such situations.\n\n[Help requested!](https://preview.redd.it/gdgeisanmjea1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4a30f0171038d78f8f3f62fe64ce72e479e8af80)\n\nThanks crew!"

What would you do in this situation? I told them a week ago that it wasn\u2019t a match. The dog is too high energy with a ton of behavioral problems. He\u2019s already caused a lot of damage to my home. I\u2019m getting frustrated, but I\u2019m not sure what to do at this point. Advice?\n\nUpdate: I spoke to them again this morning and firmly insisted that arrangements be made for me to drop him off. They said they will get back to me. I\u2019m going to give it 24 hours.\n\nUpdate 2: They have agreed to take him back this weekend! I have lost a purse and a pillow to the demon boy in the meantime, but there is a plan in place."

I remember crying for what felt like 10 minutes and I couldn't see anyone. Then a man heard or saw me in the snow and stayed with me for what I think was 15 minutes and he was the only one I could see. He stayed about 10 metres away from me and waved for help while I was in the snow. Then eventually a bunch of people turned up and somehow my Dad showed up shortly afterwards and skiied me down the slope. I often wonder what would have happened if that man hadn't showed up.",

I got in a bad habit of my teacher telling me to just watch YouTube and count it like the performer and now I can\u2019t count)\nDo you have any advice for me?

He said someone about \"ok, but they are just sunsettias, you are only attached to them because you dont have much fruit of this quality in your possession\" (to paimon) but he was hinting at the traveller that just as a sunsettia is a sunsettia, his mark is just a mark.\n\n\"when someones pockets are full and their spirit is fulfilled, they dont fall prey to this type of yearning.\" its like telling the traveller that he is happy for who he is (he made friends like amber and eula in the quest who even complimented his cooking) that his synthetic origins (the mark) do not bother him too much anymore, hence he is ok with joking about it. The traveller understands his message at the end. His part about visiting dragonspine was probably just to express how he would miss the company he had. \n\nAlso, at one point in the quest, he asks the traveller if creation or being a gardener? Is an arrogant act. The traveller responds aasking him what it felt like when he disposed of the fake albedo. He said that he felt grief. So since taking away life, the opposite of creating it is sad, then maybe being a gardener isnt so bad. \n\nI also think its worth mentioning that since this is a limited tine event, it would mean that if the albedo in mond is fake and has successfully replaced the real one, then newer players would be confused.\n\nEdit for spelling",

i started to view you in a different light. you weren\u2019t just someone who was there, you weren\u2019t just a classmate to me; you became someone special to me. albeit, i acknowledge it\u2019s definitely a strange way of realizing you like someone but the key word is realize. looking back, i probably liked you, maybe even a few weeks back. i was starting to become more subconscious of you; lowkey\u2014i wanted to hug you, deep down\u2014i thought you were cute, secretly\u2014i dreamt about you. but maybe i was just repressing those feelings, maybe i was just waiting for an actual reason why i should like you.  after all, there was too much going on in my life, and more specifically in my mind.\n\ni really don\u2019t know what started it, but i started to hate going to school. maybe it was because i didn\u2019t like waking up early, maybe it was because i had PE, maybe it was because i was scared for the new semester. whatever the reason it may be, i certainly didn\u2019t have a reason to go to school. so i didn\u2019t. i was absent. a lot. you may or may not have noticed, and maybe i secretly wish that you would at the very least wonder or maybe even be concerned about my reasons on why i was absent a lot. but anyways, not only would my motivation for going to school would go down, but also my motivation for school work. i was scared. this was exactly what i felt when i was in 8th grade. i didn\u2019t want to go back to how it was. so i tried to avoid it all together. i tried to convince my parents to have me attend online school instead, but that never amounted to anything. i\u2019m kind of glad i didn\u2019t end up switching to online school though because if i did, i wouldn\u2019t be able to see you. but i knew this couldn\u2019t last long. i eventually had to force myself to go to school. nothing much changed though, my motivation was still at an all time low and instead of just going to school, i had to force myself to go. i slept late to hopefully avoid waking up sooner, and every time i heard that annoying ring from my alarm, thoughts of \u201cshould i just not go?\u201d and \u201chow much would i miss if i didn\u2019t go to school today?\u201d would fill my mind. it was so hard to resist those thoughts but even when i managed to wake myself up, the morning wasn\u2019t any better. i was grumpy and moody, and i didn\u2019t like feeling that way either but i knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy to get out of feeling like that.\n\nuntil i realized i liked you. the world didn\u2019t actually change, but it definitely seemed different to me. i felt like i changed too. i felt more happier. i felt as if i finally had a reason to go to school. and that reason was you. i felt more energized. i slept earlier, now hoping that i would be able to see you sooner if i slept now. i was obsessed with music because of you. they were one of the only things that could help me convey even 1% of my feelings towards you. i didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to about you so i used the internet as my outlet. i absolutely love the feelings you give me. i love how giddy you make me feel. i love how excited you make me feel whenever we have some sort of interaction together. i love the feelings i get when i recall some of our past memories, even if they aren\u2019t much. \n\neven then, i knew i couldn\u2019t be with you. and when i realized that i felt my heart drop. but i did a bit of reflecting. and as much as i do want to be with you, i know it\u2019s better for both of us. i can still enjoy your presence. i can still enjoy the feelings you give me. i can still enjoy the daydreams and fantasies about you. and if i really like you, then i would let you be happy. the idea of you being happy makes me happy too. so why can\u2019t i just focus on how much you changed me for the better? why can\u2019t i just focus on how absolutely grateful i am towards you? seriously, i really don\u2019t know where i\u2019d be right now if it weren\u2019t for you. so even if we can\u2019t be something more, at the very least, i can look back and remember you as someone i have fond memories of. someone who was important to me at the time, and someone that still is. \n\nso once again, thank you.\n\nyours truly, p."

We had a quite rocky start due to covid lockdowns (long distance relationship) and have been living together for a more than a year now. At the start everything was great, quite usual happy stuff. We shared house chores equaly, went on dates regularly and spend a lot of time together. Everything looked sereous enought, he proposed before Christmas and started to talk about family more. He even mentioned how he would like to have kids together and how we would raise them. He was so exited and happy whenewer he talked about our future. Mind you I was quite sceptical at first but it was nice to see him exited so I gradualy warmed to the whole idea. We even made plans how we will renovate his parents old homestead and what we need to do and prepare in order to have a family later in life.\n\nI think everything changed in spring. We had to move to the new appartment and shortly after that his older brother suddenly died. That was quite sudden, but also hit us with huge financial strain as we basicaly had to pay for all funeral expenses. To make things worse, week after funeral my fiance got into car accident and had to spend the next month and a half on bed rest. Meanwhile I just started a new job in a completely new field of work and at the same time had to take care of my partner, work full time, clean, cook and figure out where to get money to pay rent and buy food cuz all of our saving went to the funeral expenses. Basically, 3 months later I got fired,  cuz I just couldn't keep up with what work demanded  out of me, my partner came back to his job after sick leave of  two months and got send back to unpaid leave, cuz no work to do and we are barely getting by every month. \n\nOn top of that our relationship dinamic completely changed. I tryed my best to support him emotionaly durring the hard times, but I received zero emotional support back. I basicaly have figure out how to pay rent and other expenses on my own. We agreed to pay rent in half, but every month he complains when I ask him to pay his part. I try my best to get my part by doing side hustles while I find decent job again. He complains that I don't cook often enought or don't clean the appartment 'cuz I sit at home all day and do nothing' which is not true. Also, be started smoking weed every single weekend with his drug addict friend. I guess I don't need to explain why I'm against it. \n\nWhenever I try to say something to him what I want him to do or just in general how I feel about things he gets angry and calls it 'complaining'. I basicaly can't say anything to him anymore. I feel so tired and emotionaly drained I can't anymore. Whenever we get into an argument and later make up he promises that he will spend more time with me or that we will go on a date. He keeps telling me how much he loves me and how important I am to him, but I feel like it's just words and don't mean anything. Last week I told him exactly how I feel and how I don't believe what he is saying anymore. He promised that he will show me how much he loves me and will spend some time with me on the weekend. The weekend came, he got drunk with his friend and vanished from the face of the earth again. \n\nI feel like I can't trust him anymore, I can't believe his words. I love him dearly and I still want to mend our relationship, but at the same time I start to think that I should just leave. I don't know what to do.  I feel like everything is slipping away, but if I take iniciative to mend things I'm too demanding and I'm afraid that if I don't do anything it will only get worser and worser."

It's all fun until your socks wear holes in them and you have no tread to mend them or know how to do it in the first place. I agree that no one gonna flee into the nearest fabric shop in an emergency, but natural fibers tend to rot away if kept in poor conditions f.ex. flood happens. It will be super fun to peel socks from some dead guy feet and hope that they are your size. But if you know how to knit a pair of socks you don't have to worry about that and also have a fun activity to do in the evenings or while you sit in your nicely stocked bunker and wait for the end of the world."

It was a cute roller skating game where the main objective was to spray paint anything that didn't have color, because the world turned dull or something. It was pixelated and super colorful, and the game mechanics were pretty simple: you jump when there's a gap, and spray paint whenever you see a grey wall. You could choose from 3 girl characters: one was blue, another was yellow, and the other one was pink I believe, and each had different stats. I'm pretty sure the beginning of the game opened to a lab with the girls, and maybe some scientist looking at a screen where they saw the world all grey. Anyways, this is all I remember from the game, and I know it wasn't a figment of my imagination because my brother played it and I couldn't even get passed the first level lol."

The loading screen had a light baby blue color as the background, and the loading bar was rainbow colored, with the words \u2018loading\u2026\u2019 on top with a cursive font I think. When it was done loading, you would see this eerie looking dining room? It was sorta dark, like a liminal space, and there was a figure that was standing next to the end of an empty hallway that led to the dining room. The figure was pretty creepy, it looked like a witch made out of wood if that makes sense. The figure would then get closer to the screen by suddenly appearing in different areas of the room, until it jumpscared you by popping up on the screen, with wide eyes and a wide smile. And I don\u2019t remember if there was a sound or not. Anyways, I\u2019m kinda hoping this actually exists because it felt very real to me."

I think the show was like a fighting or karate show? It was a cartoon and one thing I distinctively remember was that there was this female character that I liked bc of her character design (and I think she was the only girl character). She had comeplety white skin, and a blue tongue, and maybe a blue double bun hair style? I also remember some random scenes for this show:\n\nThe same female character I was talking about was hoola-hooping at the end of an episode, and I think she cheered or something, bc the screen closes up on her mouth at the very end (which is how I remember her blue tongue). Another thing I remember from the show was that that same character fainted from smelling something really bad, and the main character (I remember him being a short dude with black hair I think) was being all flirty saying he had to wake her up by kissing her or something. Then some old man, who appeared to be like their master or the person who's training them, put a cloth clip on her nose.\n\nI know this info is very strange and specific, but this is all I can remember from the show lol. I tried searching it up a while back but I wasn't able to find it. It might not have even been on CN or Boomerang, but those were the channels I watched as a kid."

So I was kinda angry about that ngl. But dude that\u2019s not the only reason I didn\u2019t like this group. From the very first meetings I remember... \n\nOne member was missing and another member was \u201ccontributing\u201d to the project in his own way. Giving us new suggestions only to then say \u201cidk\u201d when we ask him how we\u2019d go about doing it. \n\nThe president of the group only showed up to 2 out of the 5 meetings we had. (For the second one he showed up late \ud83d\ude02). That\u2019s our President let\u2019s gooo!!! \n\nIt felt like I was carrying the 5 of us, it was a nightmare. \n\nBut there\u2019s an interesting part to this. Our professor let\u2019s us rate each other based off of performance. And maaaaaan... it was like that sonic comic strip where the narrator said \u201cFor the first time in his life, Sonic understands the meaning of war\u201d. \n\nThe way it worked was if people got below a certain number, they would get 20 points off of their essay taken off. Possibly the first time I\u2019ve ever let myself give someone a harsh critique. \n\nThat day, it was only me and one other group member that didn\u2019t get points taken off..."

And... I was hoping that it wouldn\u2019t come down to this but...\n\nMy man... *sighs* I have to chop off some of my own parts. I legit wrote too much \ud83d\ude05but in our group meeting we decided that we would chop off parts *as a group* but since no one has made any changes yet...\n\n(Plus it\u2019s 2 days before the due date)\n\nSo now it\u2019s just me and this essay.

But this is like, procrastination version 2.0 or something it\u2019s hard to describe. \n\nSo yeah, group projects man... they\u2019re not the most fun experiences...

The same applies for habits/hobbies. dont suddenly give up something that you really like doing. take it slow and slowly distance yourself from x hobby. find a better alternative and if you cant find one then leave it as it is and move on to another aspect of your life that needs fixing.\n   also the fact that you question wether your intentions are genuine or not proves that they really are because, deep down you want to please God.\n and if this process of questioning your intentions is getting in the way of your worship then wouldn't it make sense to believe that the sense of doubt is coming from shaitan. (whatever roundabout way he's using is clearly working if at the end of the day you haven't prayed) so imo you should just go ahead and pray under the assumption that your intentions are pure no matter how much doubt there is.\n(forgive my wall of text im on mobile and idk how reddit formatting works lol)",

It\u2019s easier to numb out emotionally and never admit to fault or harm when all you do is take substances and blame everyone and everything else because it means you never have to actually try and improve. \n\nThey wanted to be victimized so bad while actually being the ones victimizing others with their lack of responsibility and constant failure to do the right thing every chance possible, simply because they kept themselves shielded from ever learning because oh ouch my ego ouchie I did something wrong. And god forbid if they did anything wrong, that would mean all the people they\u2019ve talked shit on or hurt are actually not irredeemable or bad, because it turns out everyone fucks up and forgiveness is the only way to have compassion and parent. \n\nBut nah nope alcohol is way easier to chug than learning to be accountable \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

In therapy settings, from psychotherapy professionals, and from self-help types. \n\nSaying that therapy patients are more sensitive/empathetic than other people is super invalidating, IMO. Just as much as calling them \u2018strong\u2019, most of us had no damn say in whether we wanted to be traumatized or not, the options were to endure it or die basically. That\u2019s not strength, that\u2019s survivorship. \n\nCalling victims emotionally sensitive people has extremely patronizing undertones and feels like it implies we must be extra emotional for responding the way we have to trauma. As if the average person wouldn\u2019t do what we do in our circumstances. As if everyone is just walking around with the same experiences and we just happen to be extra dramatic or something, implying things affect us more intensely rather than we are literally going through something abnormally horrible.\n\nI think the worst part is that \u2018sensitive\u2019 as a term was always thrown at me by my family when essentially begging them to stop hurting me, so was drama queen and whatnot.\n\nI know so many men who tie their identity to being the opposite of sensitive because of toxic masculinity, and go fucking figure they don\u2019t seek help out when they have their identity challenged by it if when therapy and self-help is considered by many as some service for \u2018emotional people\u2019. \n\nOn the flip side of that, I\u2019m a woman and since I have internalized misogyny myself I feel so fucking unfeminine when people throw terms like \u2018strong\u2019 at me. Makes me feel like I must look like a fucking burly lumberjack to everyone around me instead of what I see in the mirror.\n\nNot saying those views shouldn\u2019t be challenged because they should, but therapy or admitting to trauma should not be off putting because we have to have stupid comments and labels applied when seeking it out, it makes some of us avoid it. In general I just wish people would stop applying labels at all to conversations about someone\u2019s trauma, validation can simply be acknowledging they were victimized and hurt, it doesn\u2019t fucking mean we\u2019re strong people or soft people. \n\nWe\u2019re simply carrying the burden of what was done to us."

I know that probably makes me sound like some Star Wars character or something, but literally every year since my mom died (2016) I had been so reclused and withdrawn to the rest of my friends and healthy family members who truly do love and appreciate me more than I used to be able to see back then. \n\n\nMy mom was addicted to drugs and overdosed on fentanyl 8 years after my dad overdosed on bleach laced heroin, so naturally these holidays are sorta difficult for me. Everyone has been as understanding as I think they possibly can be, it\u2019s a complicated situation and if I weren\u2019t navigating it myself I don\u2019t think I\u2019d know what to do when I find out it happened to others either. \n\n\nAnyway what\u2019s really helping me now about a decade into treatment for PTSD (started after my dad\u2019s death in 2008) is moving my sad energy and feelings of despair and hopelessness into transformative energy, like telling all my friends and extended family with kids happy Mother\u2019s day and giving hugs to all moms I do know that are healthy people treating their families well. I\u2019m not a mother myself yet but I also am kind to myself today too and buy stuff with the $50-150 I would have used on my mom mom for me because of her abuse and death leaving a gap, that\u2019s my cash now to enjoy and I think of it like that. I\u2019ve also took some money I\u2019d normally spend on my abusive grandma to buy her a \u2018premium brand\u2019 item and donated it to a women\u2019s shelter, got her a card instead :)\n\n\nI\u2019m not posting this as a flex or dab or any shit like that, I\u2019ve really only recently been able to heavily look outside of my own situation and trauma and strengthen my bonds with people who matter, in the past the depression and traumatized thoughts and cognitive distortions would take over and make me shell up. This isn\u2019t advice nor is it me trying to tell anyone to do anything or whatever, I hope you all just find ways to work around a hard mother\u2019s day in any way that helps you if it\u2019s a sore spot. \n\n\nA while ago I genuinely believed recovering from PTSD/CPTSD was a hopeless battle and that I would never be able to reach out and build the bonds and friendships I had missed out on for so long, but this past year has showed me that\u2019s not the case and that I don\u2019t need to feel doomed or hopeless, my life goes on even if those who scarred me did a good job, it does heal and I\u2019m just celebrating today as a victory for how well I\u2019ve pulled it together thus far. \n\n\nTo all moms and not-moms alike I wish you a great day and hope that you take today to really care of yourselves, I hope every last person here finds peace and happiness after whatever situation happened that was heinous enough to inflict lasting mental health effects, each and every one of you deserved way better than whatever that was.

Date who you want, just remember that you are perfect the way you are until you are wronging other people--then you gotta make a change. I (20m) don't see an issue with the age gap; two grown adults should be able to make decisions about what they want in their lives.\n\nAnyways, I think age gaps usually are best defined by \"bracket\". To elaborate, the general milestones one has reached is typically the best indicator of where they are at in life, and age is only a loose indicator (although it is still important to consider). In middle school, the bracket was your own grade. In high school, the bracket was upper classmen (11th/12th) vs lower classmen (9th/10th)--I actually had to learn this the hard way. When I was a senior in high school, I fell head over heels for this girl that was in my extracurriculars, who I thought was drop dead gorgeous, as well as kind and intelligent. As it turned out, she was a freshman (I had previously figured that the youngest she could have been was 10th grade, she looked and behaved more mature than a typical freshman). I decided only to tell some \"friends\" how I felt, but some of them in turned told her behind my back and then everyone found out. I got labeled as one of those guys who has a weird interest in freshmen--even despite the fact that many freshmen made advances on me which I politely turned down. Then, because everyone assumed I was a weirdo, the girl I cared so deeply for didn't want anything to do with me. I understand how it feels to be judged over something stupid and unimportant. **Tangent aside,** the next bracket is \"college years\", so roughly 18-22. Then, it seems to be pre-parent, so 22-31ish (rough estimate), then young parent 32-43ish with maybe a kid or two, perhaps divorced, then it's like old people and then even *older* people. \n\nAs to why there are unnecessary double standards? Because most people are morons, that's why.",

Ningu\u00e9m leva a s\u00e9rio algu\u00e9m assim.\n\nDito e feito, depois de ontem, a direita que nos \u00faltimos tempos se resume apenas ao Bolsonaro (o que em si j\u00e1 \u00e9 um enorme pecado) acaba de se ridicularizar e infantilizou toda uma corrente ideol\u00f3gica s\u00e9ria.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSe n\u00f3s queremos ter qualquer chance de voltar a ser considerados como uma vertente ideol\u00f3gica s\u00e9ria, precisamos agir melhor. Caso contr\u00e1rio acabamos de dar de presente pro Lula mais 20 anos de hegemonia ideol\u00f3gica.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFazendo um TL;DR pra ficar claro: O que aconteceu no domingo foi infantil e qualquer um defendendo apenas age contra o pr\u00f3prio interesse."

This impacts my love life directly and I've been working on it.\n\nIn comes Gigguk's video and I am reminded Katawa Shoujo is a thing.\n\nI did know of it since I was a 4chan lurker since 2008, although not that regular about it and even less so nowadays. Completely fucking forgot it was a thing that existed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI already have plans on playing it simply because from the video I get the impression it could be a catalyst to deal with my own demons. But which path/girl you guys think would be similar to my case?\n\nI can edit this post to delve deeper into my stuff if people feel it necessary to pin the best route/girl for me. I just don't think I need to given there are not that many girls, plus kinda dont want to (but not opposed).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: So, about not beating around the bush with it....\n\nThe name doest really matter, but the issue I've been having seems to be about courage to trust people with it.\n\nI dont have past traumas with trusting people, its just that having a condition can be a heavy thing to bear if you dont have the right mindset. And I seem to almost desperately want to have intimacy enough to trust people with my biggest weakness, but I also wish to make my condition die with me and not let it be anyone's cross but mine.\n\nSo if I have to use one word, I'd say my issue is about acceptance. Me accepting my needs regarding it and me reaching out for someone accepting of it also."

And because enough men suck at pleasing women, the discourse is centred around how to give women a pleasurable experience as a man. I feel like i haven't much heard on how to really really pleasure yourself as a man.\n\nBecause men have been handed a very convenient way to orgasm, I feel there's a lack of incentive to explore their own body and sexuality in a way that feels \"right\" to men. So I'm gonna try to figure out alternatives, and if anyone has resources (like books or vids), please recommend them to me.\n\nAlso I feel like part of the mental block to explore my sexuality has to do with me being the force than the thing that experiences force. Like giving pleasure to women, or violating, or inserting something or giving my cum is all got to do with me happening to someone else, if that makes sense. Pleasing myself feels like Im happening to myself, which is kinda weird. In normal masturbation, I feel like me literally seeing my fluids flow out, which makes it seem like I'm not just pleasing myself, but I am soemthing that happens to things around me.\n\nI've been trying nipple play, and I have gotten better at it via understanding my sexuality but I wanna be able to orgasm through my nipples one day. At first i was rubbing it like how you would rub breasts, but that's like if you stroked your cock like how women rub their clit, it just feels off and less virile. But then I slowly had to change it to a way that feels right for me, and I suggest men to explore their body in a similar way. I feel like knowing men from history or other cultures who have different understandings of masculinity helps too.\n\nSo if you guys know anythin or any resource I can read on, I'll be interested. Or if you found this post resonates or makes you think then that's good too."

It makes sense because the times \"I'm a woman\" comes up online is when they have something negative to say about their own experience. \n\nAnd then the super interesting thing is that it actually happens, they do personally attack men, and I'm like \"hoowie, i was almost vulnerable for a second there\".\n\nI guess if it's useful then it's not a problem, but sometimes it becomes maladaptive. A lot of the times women are normal, and I'm like \"ok should i take off my armour to show my empathy, or will something happen in the future where I need it?\". I take it off, then 5 minutes they say that \"Indian men are creeps\" and I'm like \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab.\n\nI feel like I'm seeing a whole new way to see women now that I'm actually in a relationship (thanks healthygamergg!). Half the world is not a potential relationship candidate anymore. I think I'll speak my mind with women just like with men from now on, since there is no longer a need to treat them differently (heterosexuality creates difference in attitudes). The same amount of tough love I have with men i'll give also to women, with more love than toughness ofc (something people tend to forget). I think I need to unlearn the fear of getting rejected by women, since the fear of rejection ties down to my incel days. I already have someone believing in the best for me, so why do I seek more validation from strangers on the internet by saying shallow niceties? \n\nThanks for reading."

I was mostly successful: I have to do things a bit weirdly, but it's ultimately a win for me :)\n\nI downloaded Bluestacks 5, but then instead of doing anything involving bluestacks tweaker like the guide said, I followed this video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVk5vq\\_0vkE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVk5vq_0vkE)) to root it directly myself.\n\nThen I downloaded the lucky patcher per the guide (via my regular computer browser, not the emulator's browser. It automatically downloaded to my Bluestacks library anyway). Also, PLEASE for your sanity, have an adblock when visiting that website, the ads are horrendous lol. It downloaded an installer which (of course) installed Lucky Patcher itself.\n\nThen I downloaded Voiceforge to Bluestacks, signed up, etc. The app is awful btw, there are ads every couple seconds when typing what to say, and the price for a one-time download changed each time for some reason though it was always ridiculously expensive. Anyway:\n\nI kept following the lucky patcher instructions as much as possible once it was downloaded. I still have to experiment with different patches, but there aren't any custom patches like the guide hopes for. So far, I wasn't able to download the audio file past the paywall. Although, I was able to block the horrendous, interrupting ads, thank god.\n\nHowever, while I couldn't get past the paywall for a download, I don't mind one bit because the tts audio test itself is easily recordable! And that's really what you want. For example, I personally just have Audacity capture the computer audio and bam, basically the same end product!\n\nPro tip: type phuck to get Dave to actually say the f word lmao",

Joelle always hits the emotional impact perfectly, but Rikki always tugs at my heartstrings the most. Revo's and Yuuki's voices are always just gold. And this is just me going off the top of my head for the most popular singers, there are many other one off roles that I'd love to see come back more!

I guess I sort of want to min/max my anime/manga experiences for which I should read vs. watch, though, again, with a personal preference for anime adaptations if they're good enough.\n\nSo, what are some manga where its anime adaptation is so different or clearly inferior that you shouldn't bother with the show and just read the manga? (for example, I've heard people recommend reading Berserk or Black Butler instead, whose anime adaptations I've generally heard are meh compared to their original manga?) \n\nOr alternatively, are there series where the anime is fine and worth watching, but the manga is also uniquely worthwhile to read in addition to the anime?

Do any afabs want/have had top surgery and why or why not? Do any amabs prefer to keep a flat chest or develop breasts and why?***\n\nThe reason and context behind me asking this is as follows: I am an afab demigirl who has no body dysphoria but has never been that interested in how I look aesthetically. I dress more for comfort than style and tend to stick to unisex/mildly feminine stuff. I have a short, skinny, petite body that also has small breasts, and I've not really had any notable misgivings about it. However, even though I'm thankful they're fairly small, I never \"liked\" my breasts and certainly never \"welcomed\" their new sensitivity upon puberty and in general, I'm been utterly apathetic about them. So while my breasts do nothing for me, I'm fortunate to not have any real reason to need any surgery or hormones to fight any dysphoria or feel more comfortable in my body. \n\nBut then I sometimes start thinking \"what if I were to get a top surgery?\" Would I like it? Would it be worth it? Even if it's purely an aesthetic preference or a nitpick that makes me intrigued by top surgery rather than any need? What if I were to regret it? Would I prefer my small breasts or a flat chest without sensitivity or need for bras? I tell myself that it's probably not practically worth it, but every time I see someone post pictures after their top surgery, I feel a sort of envy. I miss the chest I had before puberty sometimes.\n\nNow, in the end, knowing me, I'll almost surely not ever end up actually going through with such a surgery when I consider it practically with money and other life priorities. Even so, you never know, you know?"

The recent narrative seems to heavily imply that David is the villain and everyone else is right to fear him. To me, David is just misunderstood and the path that he is on now was dictated by everyone's distrust in him implanted by the Shadow King.\n\nWhat do you think?"

I used to go on month long wild vacations somewhere in Asia and it was really good for me (letting go of everything, meeting complete strangers  every single day, getting into adventures, trying out things and having lots of fun - in one word all that stuff I normally don't do in my day to day).\n\nOther than that: in my country we did spend about 3 months locked up, which is when I was working from home, but that was at the very beginning and since then I'm back at my workplace. Social gatherings were somewhat limited at some point but it wasn't strict and was soon forgotten, so everyone mixes anyways. I can't say I'm socializing less: it was always just a little for me, and it still is just a little. \n\nWe did surprisingly well with my SO in lockdown, if anything it seems that we got closer spending so much time together when we were working from home.\n\nI also used to worry about catching it/my relatives catching it, but well, all my most important relatives including my SO have had it, luckily all of them lightly  (I haven't), so, since then it's been easier phycologically.\n\nI am very tired of all the atmosphere though. My friends from other countries ask me about how the situation is in mine, and I don't know what to say, because I think at some point my brain just stopped registering information about that.\n\nMy biggest discomfort is about online shopping lol I used to shop a lot online and now lots of shops either don't ship to my country or it takes months and often doesn't even get accepted by the postal service.\n\nAll in all I think I'm among those who have suffered the least from all this and I hope it stays that way.",

                "body": "Falling, falling, falling.\n\nI fell today.\nI fell yesterday. \nI fell the day before, and the day before that.\n\nI have been falling for the past several billion years.\n\nI have been falling for so long that I can no longer discern up from down, moving from stationary, or where I end and the environment around me begins. I\u2019ve fallen so deep that no matter how close I look, even if I place my hand to my face, I can no longer see anything. I know I still have eyes because I can feel them shift around in their sockets when I rapidly look side to side.\n\nI only know that I still exist because I have felt, and at times seen, the passage of time. I am painfully aware of each passing second. Over 31.53 billion seconds in each millennium, multiplied by however many millennia I\u2019ve been falling. In fact, when I fell, the earth on which you are reading this hadn\u2019t been created yet. \n\nI cannot see with my eyes, but I see with my mind. I\u2019ve seen each new planet, moon, star, meteor, and every other physical entity come into existence. \n\nI\u2019ve seen each dimension, each timeline, each perceived reality, and each consciousness come into existence. I feel and see each new soul that is created.\n\nI can see and feel all of these things that no one else can, yet I cannot see or feel myself.\n\nI have been falling endlessly since I decided to get closer to the pit. Why did I do that? Why did I let my curiosity get the best of me?\n\nIn the world, timeline, and position in the time-space continuum in which I originated, my physical plane of existence was quite small compared to the one in which you are on. I think the best way to describe it in a way you may be able to comprehend would be that my entire planet was the size of North America in your world at the time of this transmission of data.\n\nLike your world, my planet was mostly water. The only land mass was a round, disc-like ellipsis with a gaping hole in the center. Most of my kind (we are not at all like humans in appearance nor capabilities, but will be referred to as \u201cpeople\u201d for the rest of my communication with you and your kind, to make it a little more familiar) were innately terrified of the hole. I\u2019m sure if your species were to have one it would be used as some sort of sacrificial or executional device, or perhaps a place to dispose of dead creatures. It\u2019s one of those ridiculous, useless, and barbaric things you humans seem to cling so tightly to in the name of tradition or religion. \n\nI\u2019m not saying religion is bad or useless, because gods (or what you believe to be gods) are very real. In a way, I guess you could consider me a god, but that\u2019s beside the point. I just wanted to throw in a little disclaimer since another odd feature of the Homo sapiens is becoming very defensive and sensitive when it comes to ideas and opinions, especially those which don\u2019t align with one\u2019s own.\n\nAnyways, everyone was afraid of the pit. The few people who did try to study it all unanimously concluded that it was unsafe and whatever fell into it never came out, nor did it make a sound indicating a collision with the bottom.

                "body": "I fell today.\nI fell yesterday. \nI fell the day before, and the day before that.\n\nI have been falling for the past several billion years.\n\nI have been falling for so long that I can no longer discern up from down, moving from stationary, or where I end and the environment around me begins. I\u2019ve fallen so deep that no matter how close I look, even if I place my hand to my face, I can no longer see anything. I know I still have eyes because I can feel them shift around in their sockets when I rapidly look side to side.\n\nI only know that I still exist because I have felt, and at times seen, the passage of time. I am painfully aware of each passing second. Over 31.53 billion seconds in each millennium, multiplied by however many millennia I\u2019ve been falling. In fact, when I fell, the earth on which you are reading this hadn\u2019t been created yet. \n\nI cannot see with my eyes, but I see with my mind. I\u2019ve seen each new planet, moon, star, meteor, and every other physical entity come into existence. \n\nI\u2019ve seen each dimension, each timeline, each perceived reality, and each consciousness come into existence. I feel and see each new soul that is created.\n\nI can see and feel all of these things that no one else can, yet I cannot see or feel myself.\n\nI have been falling endlessly since I decided to get closer to the pit. Why did I do that? Why did I let my curiosity get the best of me?\n\nIn the world, timeline, and position in the time-space continuum in which I originated, my physical plane of existence was quite small compared to the one in which you are on. I think the best way to describe it in a way you may be able to comprehend would be that my entire planet was the size of North America in your world at the time of this transmission of data.\n\nLike your world, my planet was mostly water. The only land mass was a round, disc-like ellipsis with a gaping hole in the center. Most of my kind (we are not at all like humans in appearance nor capabilities, but will be referred to as \u201cpeople\u201d for the rest of my communication with you and your kind, to make it a little more familiar) were innately terrified of the hole. I\u2019m sure if your species were to have one it would be used as some sort of sacrificial or executional device, or perhaps a place to dispose of dead creatures. It\u2019s one of those ridiculous, useless, and barbaric things you humans seem to cling so tightly to in the name of tradition or religion. \n\nI\u2019m not saying religion is bad or useless, because gods (or what you believe to be gods) are very real. In a way, I guess you could consider me a god, but that\u2019s beside the point. I just wanted to throw in a little disclaimer since another odd feature of the Homo sapiens is becoming very defensive and sensitive when it comes to ideas and opinions, especially those which don\u2019t align with one\u2019s own.\n\nAnyways, everyone was afraid of the pit. The few people who did try to study it all unanimously concluded that it was unsafe and whatever fell into it never came out, nor did it make a sound indicating a collision with the bottom. It eventually became off-limits, and anyone who dared to approach its edge was swiftly apprehended and relocated after a lengthy, stern lecture.\n\nI was always a curious, fearless,  and somewhat rebellious child. The pit really drew my attention and I had spent probably the equivalent of 2 whole years of your perception of time being lectured and reprogrammed.
