They have me do the same exact troubleshooting and it gets me nowhere. I am a disabled vet with PTSD and anxiety so this can be extremely triggering for me. The weird part is, this started 2 days ago out of the blue, and besides thunderstorms, and maybe a brown out, I don't see where this is coming from.   \n\nOh, btw.

Would love to be around someone that likes to geek out on most of these subjects and is ok if my background is a bit hazy (I suck in math so I can only calculate and theorize for so long) for some of it. I am pretty grounded overall but love to indulge in 'what if' scenarios, or even the show What If?  \n\nI'd like to have these conversations on a long term bases and have it progress to voice chat or phone calls if there is a connection. Because of this, please be 35+ and single. If our conversations progress to something more, naturally having a wife is a deal breaker. I do love chatting with men with a scientific background or works in a job that directly deals with space. So if you like talking about your work, or theories behind it and want someone to talk to, I am hear to listen.\ud83d\ude0a As a matter of fact, I'll probably get depressed if you aren't.  \n\nDefinitely take a look at my post and comment history to get a gist about me and to understand my perspective about most of the interests I listed.  I am divorced for 4 years, no kids, veteran and homeowner. I supposedly match well with INTJS and Leos, or just introverted and traditional men. If you are still interested please DM or send me a chat.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanky!  \n\nEdit: I just wanted to add, I'm looking only for men, only 35 years or older, only having most of these interests. Not just 1 thing or \"some\" budding interest. I'm looking specifically for these things because I have yet to meet another guy with anything as close. Please have a job in a science field and a desire to talk about it. I am a fan/hobbyists looking for the professional. Thank you again for reading."

It\u2019s a certainty that Ti and Ne are my main functions but in which order?\n\nI am 40 years old which might be important for assessing what I\u2019m writing. I\u2019ve gone through a lot of life experiences which hopefully made me more mature but it makes typing harder.\n\n### Reasons I might be an INTP\n\n-\tThis is the result I get the most often on tests (the other ones being ENTP and INTJ)\n-\tI subjectively identify the most with descriptions of INTP\n-\tI think my demon function is Fi rather than Se (at my worst, I get very unsure of my identity and I used to be depressed when I was younger.)\n-\tI don\u2019t really need people other than my family and am perfectly happy to be alone for long periods of time as I immerse myself in my hobbies.\n-\tI used to be a loner in school, and I was also the \u201cgifted but lazy\u201d kid\n-\tI show some signs of social anxiety, and used to have that even more (feeling extremely uncomfortable approaching people etc). I actually made it into a project to get over that at some point and I somewhat successfully trained myself out of it.\n-\tI do get **very** nervous, even devastated, if I hurt someone, which I often do by accident because I\u2019m not too great at reading social cues - this might be a sign of inferior Fe\n-\tMy first instinct when I\u2019m supposed to go out is to resist, and stay home alone instead.\n-\tI\u2019m energized by alone time and need it to recharge\n-\tI often withdraw completely into my inner world in social gatherings.\n-\tI am absent-minded and clumsy.\n-\tI hate surprises.\n\n### Reasons I might be an ENTP\n\n-\tMy Si is absolute shit. I\u2019ve been unable to follow routines since I was a kid. I\u2019m always late. I can\u2019t recall past events. You get the idea.\n-\tIn fact, my cognitive function results usually go Ne/Ni > Ti/Te > Fe/Fi > Si/Se which is more in line with ENTP (or INTJ) than INTP\n-\tI am a successful corporate manager and I like that job - it\u2019s supposed to be an INTP\u2019s worst nightmare, right?\n-\tAt work, I am good at networking and maintaining informal connections\n-\tI have a ton of shallow acquaintances from various circles but I\u2019m super flaky and forget to reach out to them.\n-\tI\u2019m way more likely than my ISTJ wife to want to invite people over or go meet people - but I often only throw the idea out there and never follow through (or even cancel at the last moment)\n-\tI\u2019m loud and talkative.\n-\tPeople see me as blunt but not quiet, and I can be charming if I manage to turn down the honesty.\n-\tIn my hobbies, I\u2019m full of ideas and I don\u2019t follow through on almost any of them. (At work, I\u2019m often one that suggests improvements but can get stubborn in trying to get others to agree so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s more ENTP or INTP-like)\n-\tWhile I\u2019m not really a debater, I do like provoking people, and I tend to try and see the other point of view. (Often annoying my wife who wants to bitch about someone and I think of all the possible good reasons that person might have had for their behavior.)\n-\twhen I was little - before my anxiety kicked in - I would approach and talk to almost anyone, especially adults \n\n### How I know I\u2019m not an INTJ\n\n-\tI\u2019m definitely an Fe user, not Fi. I\u2019m way more in touch with how others feel and what they want than what I need and want\n-\tMy Te is forced and I am a master procrastinator. I work in bursts.\n-\tI\u2019m more creative than future-oriented and I often adjust my plans as I go. I.e., I\u2019m an Ne user, not an Ni user, I think.\n\nBased on this, what type do you think I am? Or what additional information would help you clarify?"

                "body": "To add to the things other people are saying about Etsy as a platform (which are true, and which you can't really change), I'll try giving you my two cents on some of the things you *can* change.\n\n* There are very few products in your shop, and they are not cleanly divided into categories. It feels unfinished and unorganized and that will not attract customers. I'm seeing stickers, next to phone wallpapers, next to stationary... I would start by creating categories (Wallpapers, Stickers, Stationary, Adoptables...) to organize the products in.\n* I would take some time to create some more designs for each category so it feels less empty, while trying to maintain some sort of visual coherence between the products. That's easier said than done of course, and you're totally allowed to have multiple styles, I just know that personally I like it when most of the products share a similar aesthetic or a similar color palette, and I sometimes end up purchasing several things instead of just one, just because they go well together. Plus, that way you could also sell similar items in sets/bundles (say you make 3 similar stickers, I would create 3 separate listings, and inside each listing add \"set of 3\" option with one of the photos containing all 3 of them).\n* The big \"CCA\" written differently on each picture is really off-putting and adds to that \"messy\" feeling. I would take 15min and design a clean, discreet watermark (like \"\u00a9 CrystalCadenceArt\" or \"\u00a9 CCA\") in a nice font, and layer that on the pictures using always the same size, and a neutral, non-red transparency color (I usually do 50% opacity white).\n* Digital downloadables are in my experience way harder to sell - even as a customer, while I could see myself buying a downloadable print, I would probably never buy a phone wallpaper, or even a sticker design; I could buy physical stickers though.\n* This one is tougher to hear, but please know I mean this in the kindest way possible: perhaps in a way your art is, as you put it, \"not good enough\" to successfully and consistently sell your work - *yet*. What I'm seeing in your shop isn't bad per se, but it does lack polish and visual consistency. The Moondrop design for instance, is cute, but the proportions are a bit off, the linework needs to be polished, the character's position could be more interesting than just them standing there, it could use some shading, etc. I would spend some more time really studying the art fundamentals and a variety of techniques (not sure if you also work with traditional art but I would definitely do that as it speeds up the learning process considerably), and more time simply drawing illustrations for yourself without the intention of selling them. It's a good idea to disconnect your worth as an artist from the fact your art sells or doesn't, take away that layer of useless pressure (since you don't have to depend on that to survive), or you're just going to end up getting discouraged from doing art altogether. Maybe you're not quite \"ready\" yet, and that's okay, simply have fun progressing and letting your personal style develop slowly for a while. I personally have started selling my art 2 years ago (in addition to y full-time job, and I probably wouldn't survive doing just art full time either lol), and I had spent 15-20 years drawing before that. What I did before simply wasn't, in my own opinion, \"sellable\" yet. And that was okay. I still loved drawing for the sake of it. In any case I wish you fun and success on your journey :)",

I started from 181lb and I\u2019m currently 138lb, my goal weight is 120-125lb. \n\nSo since last December, I\u2019ve been playing RingFit adventure (A game on Nintendo where you exercise while defeating monsters and such) at home for about 20 min to help me get some activity in 3-4x a week. But I mostly did it because it kept me in a good headspace and positive mindset. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d actually ever go to the gym but now that I\u2019m living on campus, gym is very accessible to me. I started going to the gym for 3-4x a week and been running/walking for 30 min on the treadmill and then I either do the stair master or the machine where you cycle for 10 min. \n\nSo far, I know that exercise helps you maintain some of your muscles during the weight loss process and that is why I want to keep doing it. \nOne of my goals is to work on toning my arms once I\u2019m done losing weight and I also want to gain strength so I want to start incorporating some strength training now. \n\n\n[THE PROBLEM I NEED HELP WITH!]\n\nI am feeling confused with the information I found online because I feel those are informations for guys trying to bulk? And some informations says that you shouldn\u2019t do cardio and weights on the same day\u2026 very confused. \n\nSo I\u2019m not interested in lifting super heavy weights, I just want to stick to dumbbells and do simple arm exercises that will help me tone my arms and build a lil bit of strength. (Or help preserve some of my muscles as I am in a deficit currently.)\n\nSo my questions are \n1) Is it necessary to have separate arms and legs and cardio day? (Ideally I would like to keep doing my cardio every time I go to the gym ) \n\n2) My main focus is on arms as my legs are quite slender and don\u2019t carry as much fat.Is it necessary to even focus on them? If it is then is stair master and cycling be considered good enough for legs? (I don\u2019t want to completely neglect working on them but I really don\u2019t want to do complicated things.)\n3) If I do 30 min of cardio, how long should I work on my arms or legs for?\n\nThank you for reading! Sorry if it\u2019s long and I appreciate any help that I can get."

Recently however (I would say since a year or so) I started losing complete interest in platonic relationships with both family and friends. Every time I'm in a social gathering I feel like I want to go home and that I'm wasting my time.\n\nDuring my early adulthood however, I liked having many friends and was quite outgoing. I would go to student parties pretty much every week.\n\nNow I'm apathic, people are breaking their contact with me and I don't feel anything about it. Needless to say I still never engage in romantic or sexual relationships. I don't think I'm depressed either as I still enjoy my hobbies and don't feel any despair. \n\nDid any of you experience something similar? I never got a diagnosis for anything."

That being said, most modern bras are made more for the aesthetic rather than practicality. They end up redistributing all the weight of the breasts to 2 straps at the shoulders, and the thin underbust band, which doesn't get rid of the pain as much as it just changes where you feel it. Their function is more so for modesty (covering up nipples) and shaping the breast into whatever is currently desired (in this case, the fashionable shape is an even semicircle). This is why a lot of women who technically don't need bras to help manage their chest weight will still wear them.",

He's a pretty good obstacle, and even though (from the audience's point of view), he is pure evil, it's really cool to see the standoffs between him and the heist crew like Professor and Alicia. I can't wait for his death, but it doesn't make him less interesting as a character, the actor is doing his job if I feel so animated when I see him.\n\nIn the post-Nairobi death scene he was clearly overpowered, but it's a show and they need drama so I'm willing to give it a pass."

But the issue is that there are many other examples like this; one famous example, also in graph theory, is the stable marriage problem (which also happens to reflect the social norm that only men propose to women). On the other hand, there don\u2019t seem to be any examples that promote diversity. This is really an issue that has to be understood in a broader context. (For example, if all our examples when teaching elementary school students involved straight couples, that would surely reinforce the idea that to be \u201cnormal\u201d is to be straight.)",

That is, I recognize that the Beatles were a very influential band, and on a purely objective level, I do think their music is very good. But personally, their music just isn't very special to me. There is no Beatles song that I get super pumped about listening to. To be clear, I've listened to much of their discography, but not in order (like listening to an album start to finish).\n\nCommon wisdom might be to just move on with my life and accept that the Beatles just aren't for me. But I do really want to like their music as I do personally enjoy a lot of 20th century music, of which the Beatles is a pretty defining sound.\n\nEdit: okay so I'm realizing that this is a pretty dumb post, and that this is pretty much a 100% subjective view. And I don't really see myself changing my view of this on the spot since that's not really possible. That said, I would still like to understand why other people may find the Beatles special; given how highly regarded they are amongst music enthusiasts, there has to be more that can be said other than, \"they're special because that's someone's opinion,\" right?"

Also, I experienced my mother having same sex relationship, which led to me to have a respect for LGBTQ+ people, even though I didn't know I myself one of them.\n\nwell, couple of years passed and apparently she no more had a partner, my grandma and grandpa didn't supported that idea and her relationship. So she closeted herself, after, without peace, broke up with her girlfriend.\n\nand now, about me, by the time of 2016/17, I discovered I was bisexual, didn't seem to have any inner confusion about my sexuality that time, but I tried to hide it, because I, that year, was dating my best friend. And, suddenly it happened, I came out to my mother, with a lot of fear.\n\nbut the response wasn't so great. She, furiously and continuously, began to hit me, with the belief that I was too young to know my sexuality and that the world was going to judge me. So, since that day, I started to hide it everything, even things that weren't about my sexuality. My family as a whole, slowly was discovering about my queerness, but I couldn't get to myself have strength to try to come out again.\n\nnowadays, my mother is trying to understand me better, saying things like \u201cI love you independent of your \u2018sexual option\u2019\u201d, yet, even with her trying, I feel I am not able to come out, staying quiet everytime they get on that subject.\n\nnot sure what to do, because she is a very explosive person."

We\u2019ve had procedural generation, but all you get are generic and samey worlds. Generative AI could enable huge worlds where you have humans do concept, art direction, and seeding the various areas and stories, and then AI being used to help flesh out the worlds with detail, dialogue, and assets. Assets could get reused a lot less because it\u2019s possible to just generate more of them, so instead of the same set pieces being reused everywhere, every dungeon and building can be detailed and unique. Every single NPC could have a detailed backstory and daily routine fleshed out for them. You could also get more branching storylines and more choices in the game, as generative AI could be used to help flesh out what happens when the player takes various actions, perhaps even in real-time. I think it could enable a scale of open-world game that we\u2019ve never seen before, and by potentially small, non-AAA teams of devs.\n\nImagine GTA where you can enter every building. Imagine a game world the size of Daggerfall with the rich detail of Skyrim, but where you\u2019re not railroaded into a small number of choices. All with AAA-level assets. And then imagine that an *indie studio* could make those kind of games.",

It doesn't matter what armor you actually have equipped, you will always *look like* you're wearing the override armor.\n\nI released this mod back in 2020 for SE, but it of course broke with AE.

I'm trying to replicate a certain effect where a ScrollView will draw outside of its frame in order for the contents outside of the view to appear  behind another translucent view.\n\nFor example, see this Apple Music screenshot: [https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/03/apple-music-browse.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=1600](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/03/apple-music-browse.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=1600)\n\nSwiftUI is able to give you this effect when you have a NavigationView that contains a ScrollView where you can see the off-screen contents behind the translucent navigation bar. But I want to be able to do this for any other view (like that Now Playing bar in the Apple Music screenshot).\n\nIt's not quite the same thing as an overlay, because when you do an overlay the scroll view doesn't know that the usable area is now reduced. You would then have to add padding to the view inside the ScrollView to compensate, but you still can't fix the scrollbars and there are other things that don't work well.\n\nCompare to Apple Music, where the scroll view knows that the actual usable space excludes the Now Playing bar for scrolling purposes but will still draw there for the purposes of the translucency effect. If you try to fix it in SwiftUI by making the ScrollView frame smaller, the offscreen elements are just clipped and do not show up behind the overlay at all.\n\nThere appears to be no modifier I can add that instructs the ScrollView to draw outside of its frame. So, does anyone know how to achieve this?"

I moved in with him last year and our life together has been wonderful. \n\nFor context, my boyfriend is an IT specialist, he is very experienced with technology and IT stuff. I'm still very inexperienced with technology and I once accidentally download a malware program/virus to my PC that damages it in the long term. I also once accidentally let a hacker hack my account, so yeah, I\u2019m very naive when it comes to that kind of stuff. \n\nI want to be a Visual/UI designer so I use Adobe a lot and it runs very slowly on my old PC. Last Valentine, he bought me a rose bouquet, a pastry, and a $1000 new PC so I can have better use of my Adobe programs. I was very happy and set up everything on the new PC. Then I realized that I need to install Zoom because I'm in University so I need it for my online classes. But I, once again, stupidly downloaded a virus (Trojan) from an unknown program (I naively thought it has Zoom) to the new expensive PC that he just bought for me. When I told him about it, he exploded in a way that I'd never seen before. He checked the PC immediately and reset the whole thing. Then he held my hands and raised his voice at me, \u201cARE YOU STUPID?! Why didn't you listen to me?? Do you know how much this PC cost?!\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, I'm stupid!\u201d as I was explaining to him my mistake while at the same time trying to hold back my tears. He then apologized right away and said that I'm not stupid, just wasn't thinking straight. He was still very angry and lecturing me how to avoid viruses and scammers/hackers, while I kept apologizing repeatedly and was unable to focus on what he said because I just couldn't stop crying. I was so hurt and scared. I felt as if I was a little kid being scolded by an adult, and it somehow felt humiliated. I\u2019d never seen this side of him before. \n\nThe PC is fixed but I was still crying. He tried to comfort me, said that he loves me, said that I'm actually smart, and said that he got angry because he was worrying about my future if I keep making mistakes like this. But I was still very shocked by it. I had a traumatizing childhood that involves people calling me academically stupid and belittling me for my lack of intelligence, so what he said to me really brought me back to that childhood. It felt like everything was repeating itself again; the trauma, the stupidity, the criticism, the insecurity. \n\nA part of me wants to leave him, but a part of me wants to stay with him. I tried to comfort myself that his anger was reasonable and that he didn't mean what he said. I made a mistake and I should've known better. But still, I couldn't shake off the fear that comes with me when I think of him. My feeling for him might no longer be the same after that."

I contacted the IT help desk and they said that my student email had been compromised and that it had been hacked, so they locked my account. They asked me to take a screenshot of my Windows security scan to prove the device has no virus. Luckily, the screenshot showed that my PC has no threat of viruses, and the IT help desk unlocked my student email/student account. BUT then, even though my student account is unlocked, my two-factor authenticator had been disabled so I still couldn't get into my account. It was around 5 pm and the IT help desk and Administration office were closed. I had no choice but to accept the fact that I won't be able to attend my Monday evening class.\u00a0\n\nThis whole incident was partly my fault because I got scammed by someone who pretend to be the SFSU IT help desk and they asked for my email password. That was naive of me to give away my password and email to a scammer. I stupidly gave them the opportunity to hack into my student account.\u00a0But this morning I contacted the IT help desk and they unlocked the two-factor authenticator so everything is kinda back to normal now.\u00a0BUT...\n\nThe hacker used my email to send out bullshit job applications to 399 (!!!) SFSU/other university students and faculties. After that, Microsoft blocked my email so they cannot send any other email at all. But that means I won't be able to send an email either. I had to rely on my Gmail to send an email because my student email is having an error at the moment. The worse is that those SFSU students are sending me emails in regard to that job application and I couldn't send them back any of my emails to tell them that the job application they receive from me was a scam.\u00a0\n\n**If any of you received a false job application email from Anna Pham (my student email), please know that it was a scam!

(Au PIRE une anglais, mais fran\u00e7ais me para\u00eet bien plus pertinent, ne serait-ce qu'en terme de lois)  \nJe caresse l'id\u00e9e de reprendre une petite boutique de CBD (3500\u20ac fond de commerce). Je sais qu'elle couvre d\u00e9j\u00e0 ses frais mensuels en terme de rentr\u00e9e d'argent (mais pas beaucoup plus que \u00e7a, elle a 3 mois, le vendeur(h/21) aimerait discuter avec ses grossistes pour m'avoir ses prix d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but). Il la vend car il aimerait avoir le quick cash (3500\u20ac pour le fond de commerce et se reconcentrer sur sa premi\u00e8re boutique de CBD qui marche d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien, car il a eu une mauvaise exp\u00e9rience avec son premier employ\u00e9, il trouve \u00e7a trop stressant et veut reprendre + de temps pour ses famille/ch\u00e9rie/amis)  \nLa boutique est dans la rue commer\u00e7ante principale de ma ville (si ce n'est pas la seule d'ailleurs, 7200 habitants pour l'instant + une multitude de petits patelins autour).  \n\n\nVu l'accessibilit\u00e9 du prix et le peu de risques vraisemblables, j'ai envie d'essayer, j'ai cependant une appr\u00e9hension, d'o\u00f9 ma recherche de vos avis messieurs, dames les business(wo)men : Il y a une autre boutique de CBD litt\u00e9ralement 500m plus loin. Moins bien plac\u00e9e que celle sur laquelle j'ai des vues. Ils semblent avoir un peu plus de moyens de base aussi.  \n\n\nEst-ce que la ville est assez grande pour nous deux ? Ai-je une chance de couler ? Y a t-il des moyens de me rendre + concurrentiel ? (Il n'y a que ces deux boutiques de CBD dans la ville). Les autres boutiques les plus proches sont respectivement \u00e0 30 minutes et 45 minutes de la ville.  \n\n\nJe vais mettre cette page dans mes favoris comme \u00e7a je pourrais revenir \u00e0 elle pour relire vos conseils si j'en ressens le besoin. Merci d'avance \u00e0 tous ! (PS : j'ai h\u00e9sit\u00e9 entre Ask France et \u00e9conomie, vous me dites si c'est pas bon)"

Chase music different from each killer is a pretty good start. Like a bit of small talks in between survivors when they cross each others or more taunt when killer get someone (STAAAAARS, and stuff like Cenobite) Did you never repeated quotes you like from your favorite video games characters ? I sure did !  \n\n\nThanks in advance to whoever will take time to answer this... I may repost this if this doesn't get enough attention."

It would turn around your head (kinda like a flail?) and the more it grew the larger the surface it covered\n\n**Other details:** Most of the game happens in a castle, I do have a memory where we could were on the top of the castle"

I would say that both of us are mature, but we both have our challenges. We have been together for 2 years. I can immediately say that this has kinda been the most challenging relationship of mine (have been in 3 other relationships before), but probably also the most rewarding. We are both big fans of self development and reflection. We just found out a couple of weeks ago about MBTI and our personality types which has opened up our eyes to the reasons of many of our differences. It was honestly a bit tough for me in the beginning, because sometimes I don't even like my own personality type, and I would sometimes wish that things were easier. But I also appreciate how far we've come and how much we've learned.\n\nI've seen that many posts on reddit that are about INTJ's and ISFJ's in a relationship are very negative, and many people say that this combination is doomed and you should just steer away. Therefore I wanted to make this post, to highlight not only the negative things, but also the positive things, and contribute to more understanding.\n\nSo, if you have any questions about anything, whether it be how we met, how it was in our dating phase, our challenges, the positive etc, feel free to ask.\n\nPS. I'm also HSP, so that helps \ud83d\ude05"

I don't watch anime that much becuz i always ended up feeling too much into it but this one almost had me quit in the middle becuz i was feeling too emotional after watching some episode that it got me upset. I ended up watching it all becuz i want to know the story til the end. The episode about the doctor guy and the real Kyokun got me so nostalgic. I really like the way the stories progress with telling stories about each person and their weakness. It's like telling how every human have their own flaws that they don't want others to see. Man, i am so into this anime. I'm thinking about taking a break for a bit or I might end up watching s2 right away....."

                "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am an 18-year-old male. Since the beginning of my scholarship, I have been described as discreet. That is because I am shy. I am not very introverted, I like talking to people, but I'm too shy. I like logic, programming, math. I love planning ahead what I will do. So I know I'm an xNTJ. But I think my shyness mistyped me for an introvert. In the past, I was a lot of time alone, but not by choice, just by shyness.\n\nI like having control over things and organizing other things like projects. \n\nA possible diagnosis that could impact my stability is derealization, which makes me anxious.\n\nI am a student, I just graduated and next year I will enter an engineering school (I'm very happy). I want to work either as a developer or as an engineer in the army.\n\nIf I spend an entire week by myself, I would play a lot (CoD, Overwatch, GTA, MTGA), read (thus spoke Zarathustra for now). Watch some animes... I would feel good at the beginning but a bit lonely. And also meaningless: I need to work, or to do something that I find meaningful, to keep me busy for at least a few hours. If I don't, I feel bad and unproductive.\n\nI am not good at sports, because I am clumsy. I like Badminton, Football (or soccer), but I'm very bad. I like playing chess with friends, or Magic the gathering.\n\nSince I was a child, I always have been pretty curious. For example, if I see a problem that needs to be solved. I can't stop thinking of possibilities \"what if ...\". My mind is creating small ideas in the background, and then I get an insight. It's like constant brainstorming. My curiosities are about history, science... but can be morbid sometimes. For example, just a few hours ago, I thought: \"what if all people of all races mixed ?\", \"How would these human beings look like\", \"will it end racism and hatred ?\".\n\nI would enjoy a leading position, I think I would be good at it, not excellent but good at tasks managing, organization, etc...\n\nMy leadership would be oriented towards planning and time efficiency. I like attributing tasks to everyone and the time they have to do it for us to finish in time. It would be professional and assertive.\n\nAs I said earlier, I am not very coordinated. I feel like I'm less energetic than other people of my age (just a little less). I don't really work with my hands, except when I play the violin.\n\nI am not particularly artistic, I can draw but just by reproducing other drawings. I really like surrealism, especially when the painting is depicting weird surreal creatures. Or environments. For example, *The fireside angel* and  *La Tentaci\u00f3n de San Antonio.* I don't know how to explain it, but seeing giant empty places or giant surreal creatures satisfies me.\n\nI think a lot about the past, but I think I should only get lessons from the past and then don't think about it, it's finished, I can't change it. So there is no point in regretting things. In the present, I think about what I will do in the future. I deal with the future with a bit of anxiety, except when I have a plan, then I'm confident.\n\nWhen people want my help, I help them most of the time. I have always done that. I do it when I have some time, else I tell them where they can find help because I'm don't have the time. When people are not grateful or treat me like I owe them something, I don't help them. Or if I just don't want to help them (it's rare).\n\nI do need logical consistency, if you want me to do something, I have to know exactly why, and how it will be meaningful and useful. I don't want to do things because \"that's the way it is\" or \"that's the way we always did it\".\n\nI like learning by doing, for example in Math or programing. I also like memorizing, for example, key points, or formulas by logic, by explaining them. I need things to make sense for me to learn them.\n\nI think I am good at strategizing, thinking of every possible outcome, and be prepared for it. I split tasks, create a plan with timelines. I plan meetings to make sure everything is done in time.\n\nI want either to study computer science or military engineering. Either way, I want to create a company and lead it in one of these fields. personally, I want to learn a lot about philosophy, science, and history, to increase my well-being both mentally and physically. I also want to learn languages like Dutch, German, Arabic, and Hebrew. I have an idea, that is \"being the best version of myself\".\n\nI fear losing control over myself, or the situation I'm in. If something goes wrong. It makes me anxious and I feel more derealization. It may be stupid I know, but one day I planned to eat at Subway, but they were closed. I was really annoyed, and I felt like my day was ruined. (I feel ridiculous saying that lol).\n\nThe highs in my life : I am confident, logical, a bit reserved, kind.\n\nThe lows : Stressed, angry/sad, meaningless, mad for anything.\n\nSince I am a child I daydream a lot, sometimes I don't pay attention to people speaking and I nod without listening. When I daydream I'm still somewhat aware of my surroundings. I hate being unaware, so I don't listen to loud music for example so I can hear around me.\n\nIn a blank room : I look around me, and I try to find a way out I guess.\n\nSometimes, people ask me to make a decision quickly, I don't want to. I have to see the pros and cons, and then decide. Sometimes it's quick because I know what I want, but I can take more time to analyze, and I don't like when people pressure me to make a choice. I don't change my mind a lot, because I think I made a good decision. But sometimes, people argue with me, and they give good arguments so I change my mind.\n\nAbout the emotions, I always did this for anger: Someone pisses me off, I don't react, again, again again, and then boom. I let it all out. It's not healthy, but I have trouble expressing my emotions, saying \"I love you\" to people, or explain when I'm sad. I just don't think about it and keep going forward. Otherwise, when I'm sad, I try to find why I feel this way, and kind of fix it. But sometimes it's just irrational, for example, sometimes I have an inferiority complex about physical traits, and I take a few hours to deal with it, after that, I don't think about it.\n\nSometimes I find myself agreeing with people because I don't dare to oppose them, at least that was when I was younger (14-15), but I changed. Now I say what I think. I may agree with someone for them just to stop annoying me or another person. When people are convinced they are always right, we can't reason them, so I stop trying.\n\nI don't break the rules for the sake of breaking the rules, I don't feel good about it. But if some rules are stupid, I will break them. For example, in religion: My religion forbids me to cook veal with milk (Judaism), because it would be immoral to cook a child in the milk of its own mother. But now people avoid mixing chicken and milk... It doesn't make sense, so I don't want to respect this rule. I don't do it often, but sometimes, even authorities have to be questioned.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThank you for reading my post, I wanted you to type me and see if I'm really an INTJ, because it's been a year that a lot of tests tell me INTJ and ENTJ, and I don't know which one I am."

Sometimes in the wrong way or about the wrong thing. \n\nI\u2019m in a lovely relationship with a person I really love and enjoy being around. Everything is great except for our fights. I am critical, he is defensive. Our natural tendencies towards these conflict styles exacerbates our conflicts. \n\nWe have had many wonderful talks and discussions once our egos and emotions are no longer part of our conflict, but when they are, they tend to spiral into a bigger and bigger argument rather than us keeping the conflict in a more reasonable frame for discussing and resolving. \n\nI\u2019m focusing right now on my accountability and how I can make things better in our relationship. I know this will also help me be better in my friendships and working relationships, so I\u2019m very eager to learn how to transform my critical mind into something more useful and helpfully communicative. \n\nFor example: I was discussing why something had upset me. I told him what he had done and how that made me feel. This made him feel attacked. I felt like I was trying to give him a road map that would help him understand. \n\nWhen we got off the phone, I was able to see a bigger picture (after having discussed the issue with him) about how, yes, those actions did inspire those feelings, but that the end goal of how I felt and what would have been a better way for things to happen is the information that I actually needed to communicate. (THIS happened and it made me feel THAT thing, and if THIS had happened instead, I wouldn\u2019t have felt that way). \n\nHow do I learn to see this before I speak? How do I learn how to change the relationship between myself and my feelings and thoughts so that I can use the data I\u2019m collecting to benefit and support my communications rather than undermine them. \n\nThank you Reddit."

I know I searched high and low for reviews before my purchase and there weren\u2019t many posted. Hopefully this helps the next buyer! \n\n\nI bought:\n1 Sofa \n1 Corner\n1 Chair and a Half\n2 Ottoman\nLeather Covers \n\nReasons I wanted this couch:\nAbility to design the couch based on measurements \nAbility to store things under the seats\nAbility to change couch look by buying new covers\nAbility to replace pieces individually if something tore/got stained\n\n\nFirst up: Visuals I love the look of my couch. Dimensions wise it\u2019s perfect for my space and exactly what I wanted. When I walk into my home or around the living room I\u2019m happy with the visual impact my couch has on the room. I don\u2019t think the leather patterning is super nice it looks a little cheap to me but honestly for buying a couch online, I\u2019m happy with how it looks! \n\nComfort: it loses stars here for me. While it\u2019s not entirely uncomfortable it\u2019s definitely not a couch that wows me in comfort. I DID try the chair before ordering and a few people sat in it and I decided it was worth getting the couch. I bought the pieces that I did because the sofa and chair and a half have wider seat cushions than the chairs and I figured it would be better. \n\nThe foam is not all that supportive. You just sink into it wherever you are. The back pillows are more comfortable to me than the seat pillows. It would be nice if the weight distribution was better. I don\u2019t often find myself uncomfortable on the couch but if I\u2019m there for a long time I change positions for sure. \n\nIt\u2019s also not very wide. With the back pillows on the depth is a bit lacking. If I want to comfortably lay on the couch I take the back pillows off. It would be hard and probably not comfortable for two people to lay side by side on this couch. \n\nStorage: it\u2019s small but I knew that. And it\u2019s just the raw material, which I knew but I didn\u2019t realize how messy it is. I have DVDs in the storage so it\u2019s fine. But if you wanted to store extra blankets in there\u2019s I\u2019d say no. You\u2019ll end up with wood flakes/splinters in it. I think it would be both cheap and easy for the company to design a fitted cardboard liner box to allow you to store things safely in the couch. \n\nBuilding the couch: wow. This was a much bigger project than I realized. I have built MANY things in this apt and my last. Shelves and cases and bed frames and dressers and tables... I buy a lot of furniture online or at IKEA and I have no qualms about putting things together myself. This project was a much bigger project than I realized. I\u2019m single and I did it by myself. \n\nFirst off, they provide gloves but no mask. Wear a mask while working on this! (Thankfully were all equipped to do so these days!) This couch is very messy and you\u2019ll have to clean a couple times all the wood shavings and splinters that fall off. I didn\u2019t use the gloves because I have my own leather ones. I suggest you use the same. \n\nFirst of all, several of my boards came broken in my first shipment. That might have been the crappy delivery people who broke it but the fact remains that day one I found I had 3-5 broken pieces and had to have them replaced before I could build the couch. I was obviously very irritated by that. Some of the pieces were also imperfect. You\u2019ll see layers of the wood pressed together to form each piece and some will have chunks just fall off. There\u2019s a 10 year warranty on the frame so I\u2019m not worried about it, and it\u2019s probably what\u2019s in many couches you buy pre assembled but it sucks to look at since it\u2019s brand new.\n\nMy L shape couch was a lot of work getting all the pieces together but not terrible. It felt like the harder part was putting the material on the couch. I have leather so it\u2019s probably one of the tougher ones to get on there. Lining up seams and stretching the material was annoying. I don\u2019t like that kind of finessing. \n\nLastly, I noticed the other day the seat cushion cover of the spot I sit in regularly is pulling away from the stitching. I believe there\u2019s a warranty on the covers which I\u2019m going to inquire about soon. That seems really early to have happened. Not stoked about it. I flump into the sofa but I don\u2019t do it unreasonably imo. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been extra hard on it. \n\nOverall I\u2019d give the couch a 6-7/10. Especially for the price. \n\nWould I buy it again if I could do it all over? \nMaybe. I did research a lot of options and I really am most pleased by the size of this couch for the room I have it in. I\u2019ve fantasized about getting better foam cushions for the couch made to upgrade the comfort but if I\u2019m honest I\u2019d rather buy the couch I really wanted when I move to a place I can have it (I wanted electric reclining sofas which would have taken up ALL the space to use and didn\u2019t make sense here). So I\u2019ll probably just keep it as is and be done with it when I\u2019m done with it. \n\nI hope that helps. Good luck on your couch purchase whichever way you go. I tried to be honest so you can decide for yourself."

Happens all the time. Deal with it.\n\nAs for the tough girl act.. I see it as a problem when writers try to make their characters two or more things at once. 365 Days (which, despite the hate it gets DOES have this popular trope in it) is a clear example. Is she the kind of woman who \"stands her ground\" and \"needs challenges to feel alive\" or is she a (low-key willing) captive lover of a mob boss who's always forcing himself on her?\n\nYou're either one or the other.

My understanding of this whole thing is that Szeklers want to distance themselves from Hungary because they see themselves as the \"real Magyars.\"\n\nWhy would they want to throw off anything related to Austria?\n\nWhat I'm *assuming* is going on here is that the Szeklers view Austrian connections as the thing that separates themselves from those in Hungary.. therefore by \"throwing off the Austrian yoke\" they become closer to what they see themselves as.\n\nBut Idk. I am but a filthy American with a filthy American's education on the rest of the world so.. correct me."

They're designed to push the pop culture image.\n\nHis blind weeb-itude is causing him to spread misinformation and it makes me furious when I think about it.\n\nFunny thing is he swears that he's not a weeb because he actually understands Japanese culture (which, granted, he does very well), but he's a complete sucker for the romanticization of Japanese military history.\n\nDude said that firearms were seen as something for Ashigaru during the sengoku age as opposed to the \"honorable samurai.\" Not sure how relevant that is to this subreddit but just to give you an idea.\n\nOn one occasion I saw someone say that he and Anthony Cummins should do a collab.

Formatiunea in sine este de centru si merge pe o platforma de anti-coruptie si pro-europeanism.\n\nDesi este noua, a luat la ultimele alegeri, care au avut loc ieri, 26%. Ma face sa ma gandesc cum miscarea anti-coruptie de la noi a incetinit de cand cu pandemia si de asemenea noile crize aparute in ultimul timp au pus si mai multe frane. Lumea nu mai vede o prioritate in acest moment lupta anti-coruptie si tari de sub noi pare ca ne iau inainte, avem Bulgaria cu un partid anti-coruptie la 26%, Moldova cu unul la peste 50%. USR+ a ramas practic in urma. Singurul mod sa isi revine este ca pandemia, inflatia si altele sa se potoleasca pana in 2024, moment in care coruptia PSD-PNL poate intra din nou in spotlight. Insa daca asta nu se intampla, miscarea anti-coruptie va fi practic amanata pana in 2028.\n\nMai este problematic si faptul ca USR+ nu mai e practic un partid nou pentru ca a participat deja la guvernare. Motiv pentru care daca AUR isi inteteste discursul anti-sistem si anti-coruptie sunt sanse sa domine peisajul, lucru care ne-ar duce doar inapoi in 2016. Si se va mai pierde un deceniu ca apoi sa zicem \"partidele care distrug Romania de 40 de ani\" in loc de 30. Vor trece 10 ani fara vreun progres sau vreo reforma."

After that, I spent an entire year (2019) on my own watching everything I could in English, and when I got back to the same teacher we mainly focused on getting me ready to take the TOEFL.\n\nSo... learning English was pretty easy. My question is, what should I expect now that I want to learn Chinese? To those of you whose English is also your second language, what are the differences you noticed between the learning process of the two?\n\nedit: due to financial reasons, I cannot get a tutor this time, so I'll be learning on my own."

Like at all. If anything, social expectations only made it worse! Before that, I was primarily hyperactive. So much so that I would sometimes flap my hands and shake my body to get rid of my (seemingly endless) energy.\n\nBut as an adult, I have so. many. autistic traits. For real. I managed to make a document that is 30 pages long with most of my traits (with brief explanations of course). But since my social difficulties were more ADHD related until I got into 3rd grade and I was mostly a sensory seeker, I question myself a lot. Could I really be autistic if these social difficulties only became apparent later on (specifically when friendships became more complicated)?\n\nI am 100% sure this isn't 'just ADHD' or a combo of ADHD + trauma because... it simply doesn't make sense. Many many things would be left out or ignored. I barely included ADHD traits on that list. I have an appointment with a psychologist on Thursday, but I can't help but think... what DO I have? How come I went from just being 'fun and quirky' to feeling overwhelmed when someone has a very expressive face?! Can any of you relate to that?\n\nPS: The reason I care so much is that those traits affect me daily in many areas of my life, so by getting a formal diagnosis maybe I can get some accommodations to help me too."

I do want to go to the psychologist but this and the fact I'm not sure if I have enough money are the reason I haven't done anything yet.\n\nMoving on, I often struggle with talking about my feelings and things that trigger me. My throat literally closes and sometimes (thankfully it doesn't happen often) I almost suffocate. I have a normal life and my happy moments, but I just don't know how to manage the bad ones. This can happen in front of other people but mostly I get so terrified of talking about it that I just involuntarily force myself to look better while alone it would easily evolve to a panic attack.\n\nI swear to god I don't know what's happening to me, I just feel so terrified of talking that I avoid it at all costs. I even considered learning sign language to communicate to a therapist but I realized I'd be uncomfortable in their presence as well because just the idea of being in the same room as the other person when talking about these things feels repulsive. I don't like to feel their eyes over me or to feel strong (negative) emotions in the presence of others.\n\nThis has been happening for years and I often run from my family and from any form of kindness, be it from my mom or a friend because it feels suffocating and scary.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this..?"

Creates inequality which breeds polarization. Combine this with immigration and you have right-wing racism.\n2. Countries we trade with don\u2019t seem to liberalize but they do get richer. Having powerful authoritarian countries is bad.\n3. Makes us more dependent on other countries.\n\n\n\nMy guess, the answer lies in the middle somewhere."

I\u2019m stalled. I have no money. No gems. I\u2019m like 3 levels from king tower 10. And I can\u2019t climb. The only thing I can do is take out my not-mastered-yet, severely under leveled cards and try to get wins so I can get the mastery money. I\u2019ve lost 10 in a row. I have no idea what decks to use or how to use these cards.\n\nIt\u2019s weird because I thought using one deck was the best way to climb with a lower king tower and under leveled cards. That way I\u2019d be super skilled with that deck and my cards would be less underpowered so I\u2019d be able to compete. It\u2019s a great feeling to be able to beat players who have better cards and towers than you. \n\nI guess I was supposed to level my cards evenly in order to get more exp at the expense of my ladder climbing. Feels kinda stupid tbh.\n\nWas I playing the game wrong this whole time?\n\nAny advice on decks using different cards than the ones I\u2019ve been using?"

If you can pay workers with an IOU then that means money is getting spawned into existence via IOU\u2019s. This is because government is the source of all the currency for everybody, the source of legitimacy, and the enforcer of the laws. If it wanted to borrow money, it would be borrowing from itself then promising itself to pay itself through legal contract.\n\nThat seems like it has several problems that only apply if IOU $ can be used to pay people in regular $ (so let me know if this is the case or not):\n\n\n1. A government could just hand out IOU\u2019s forever. Its essentially borrowing $ from its future taxes. So as long as it has a future, it has infinite IOU\u2019s to pay anyone any amount.\n\n2. If the government is giving IOU $ to an entity but it can be used/converted to regular $, that IOU $ is increasing the pool of $, decreasing the value of $ to a real economy, and making all the prices go up for everything in response. IOU $ would be hidden from the economy but still multiplying the amount of real $.\n\n\n3. If this IOU has interest, then all the effects are multiplied and it insures the need to print money since more money would be owed than exist.",

I know I probably still have my own vestiges of my experience that I strive to notice and correct from. I try not to judge how people process through this stuff because there\u2019s some things people just aren\u2019t ready to confront like that, they can\u2019t afford to due to circumstances, or they just aren\u2019t aware of it at all. I think the togetherness and acknowledgement is healing even if it\u2019s in this joke downplaying way and I usually leave it at that. \n\nOn average I believe people trend towards the alleviation from such behaviors. However, every generational line has a different rate and definitely different familial narratives to process through as well.

I don\u2019t know when I got this idea but I used to really hate it and make that problem and the hypocritical nature of people and my own emotions my whole life resentment.\n\nMaybe at 18 this all changed when it dawned on me by a relatively insignificant experience, that the only one I\u2019m hurting being resentful of existence is myself. Everyone else shall smile whether I believe them ignorant of the human condition or not and sitting around being a meme wasn\u2019t gonna change that. However I didn\u2019t realize that I realized that at the time. I though of it more like \u201c\ud83d\ude27\ud83d\ude36 I don\u2019t know anything... \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe Now I don\u2019t have to live with the garage interpretation of reality, I made for myself,\u201d which I find quite humorous.\n\nSo I started to shift my priorities to \u201chow do I get out of this hell hole\u201d and \u201cwho am I anyway? And what is the world really?\u201d For what it\u2019s worth I had always wanted to \u201cUnderstand the world enough to love it\u201d but I kind of misapplied that along the way.\n\nI\u2019d say in the new pursuit of happiness or clarity or escape, I\u2019ve also found that I walk right into new boxes that are often remarkably similar, though different in form. It takes me doing a stupid thing over and over a couple times to realize that I\u2019m probably better off just writing off the operation until some undetermined later date.\n\nAll of that to say, my pursuit of happiness instead of sitting in hatred has given me more awareness about what I don\u2019t want than a real sense of where happiness is or what the hell it even looks like or what I\u2019m even looking for. It\u2019s like throwing away a bunch of old shitty furniture and even photos of them, only to find a silent space waiting for you to do something. At first such a space my be nostalgic because of the past, then exciting because of the future. After using all that excitement to make a new space, you found that with different furniture, you\u2019ve made the same place you lived in before somehow then increasing the scale of change to the entire apartment, then state, then country.\n\nI find it remarkably hard to shift my thinking and decision making off the premise of a problem I\u2019m trying to solve or perfect state I\u2019m trying to reach. How does one make or strive for a goal not fundamentally motivated by lack of the goal? I see myself so much more clearly and honestly than I did even two years ago. Yet this riddle never really gets untangled.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m just fiddling with the wrong bag of skittles. This was nice though. Maybe I\u2019ll do this more often when my thoughts really floor it."

Ive seen so many little manifestation and I know the law is real from so many of those but I kept kind of feeling stuck. It would manifest as feeling uncomfortable with action towards the \u201cbig things\u201d I wanted and a constant sense of confusion about what to do. Whenever Id live in the state of the wish fulfilled, I wouldn\u2019t actually feel the joy and excitement of getting it, especially after the first imagining of it.\n\nSo I\u2019d go back to studying all kinds of people until I feel like I\u2019m ready and Id take one step that would be fine and fun to do. But I\u2019d say \u201chey I did it and I enjoyed it! *Progress*\u201d and go back to studying or imagining. Thus the cycle would repeat. However I just had a breakthrough that I think might help a lot of people.\n\nWay before Neville, I always used to say \u201cI get what I want 95% of the time and the 5% is if I still want it.\u201d Today I reflected on why does that 5% even exist, and I realized that I had a fear that what I wanted wasn\u2019t going to be right for me. I think I\u2019ve wanted things and gotten them only to feel disappointed/stuck with some outcome i didn\u2019t want. So to cope I would just sabotage my success at the end with doubt about if i even wanted the thing or Id lose the thing right at the end. If the most perfect situation, Idea, relationship, or opportunity showed up and was staring me in the face, I would feel perpetually uncomfortable with passing over the finish line to my happiness and enjoying it. In addition, all of my ease and success turned into *progress* towards a perfect life rather than *proof* that I was living that perfect life.\n\n\nWell, I *am* perfect and whatever I *want* is perfect for me. I don\u2019t need to make sure it\u2019s a perfect desire and I don\u2019t need someone to see me as perfect for them. I\u2019ve been perfect the whole time for myself and everyone around me so I don\u2019t need to get to some ideal place (though I\u2019m positive that it only gets better from here) as my perfect desires are sitting all around me every day. I just didn\u2019t go for it because of the old belief. Turns out I\u2019ve been getting 100% of what I wanted all along haha!\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a subtle hang up that I already feel really has shifted my perception of life, so I thought I\u2019d post it for others who feel they really understand the law and know it\u2019s real but had a hard time with \u201cthe big stuff.\u201d It\u2019s only big because you think your small! But you\u2019re literally Perfect. You can want whatever you want!\n\n I\u2019m so excited for all the things I can do! I look forward to coming back and posting some really juicy success stories for you guys! I can finally feel the joy of all the things I\u2019ve been imagining this past year and the paradox between being present in life and living in the wish fulfilled finally makes a whole ton of sense!"

I like to laugh and have fun and share that with others. I ask a lot of questions as I\u2019m naturally curious. I stand up for the people I care about and Im aware of my emotions and very much take responsibility for whatever hurts me.\n\nI want, more than anything, for people (and hence my partner) to feel free to be themselves and feel safe enough to be honest. I never blamed others for my hang ups and confusions. All of these things were very much appreciated and admired in the relationships I\u2019ve been in and I value these relationships for the growth and great times I\u2019ve had with them.\n\nHowever I\u2019ve come to a realization that my easygoing attitude also made me too willing to negotiate with destructive mindsets that other people had and in the end, compromising and working with those mindsets seemed to be the problem that ended these relationships.\n\nHere are some of the not-so-obvious beliefs I\u2019ve come to realize is corrosive to trying to build intimacy with a woman, as a man. They likely apply vice versa and to LGBTQ+ gang as well. I hope that other guys can avoid stumbling into the trap of believing somethings wrong with them (or are weak/unworthy) for not being able to make the impossible work out.\n\n1. The perceived sense that love or manliness (I can\u2019t tell which) is \u201cthe act of sacrificing your happiness for another.\u201d Basically, she only feels loved in Win-Lose situations and only gives love in Win-Lose situations. She believes if you don\u2019t suffer you don\u2019t love her and if you create a win win situation she doubts if you care. She will also point out (to prove her love) that she\u2019s suffered by doing x y z that you thought she did out of genuine love and kindness which also sucks to hear as you\u2019d rather she just didn\u2019t do it.\n\n2. The perceived sense that other people outside of her have a better sense of what is valuable or good for her. She tries to prove your a catch to her friends, she tells you about what her friend\u2019s bf is doing, is easily influenced out of things she previously really wanted or is doing some kind of compare and contrast with you. She\u2019s in a \u201crace for the best life to her friends\u201d, not for her happiness. She will believe you are making her lose her race to no where.\n\n3. The perceived sense that she knows what you think and feel. She\u2019s not gonna ask questions about where you\u2019re coming from and will be reacting from perceptions of you that you can\u2019t possibly keep up with. She either gonna be jumping to action to protect herself from you, jumping into action to punish you, letting distrust and resentment fester, or grow more emotionally distant. Regardless, it\u2019s gonna hurt to even try to change her mind or prove to her otherwise, the longer it goes on.\n\n4. The perceived sense that her happiness and safety are your responsibility. This isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s not in your interest or that you don\u2019t want to add to these things at any opportunity you can. taking initiative on behalf of your partner feels good and is appreciated. However, if she\u2019s dependent on/waiting for you to make her happy when she isn\u2019t happy or feel safe when she doesn\u2019t feel safe, she\u2019s gonna believe it\u2019s you messing up every time she feels like less than her best rather than do what she did before she met you to self-soothe. She will stop taking initiative for her own needs and stop asking for support gracefully (meaning with the acceptance and openness to a no).\n\n5. The perceived sense that your emotions and feelings \u201csay something\u201d about her worthiness, value, or self-esteem. If you feel like you can\u2019t actually express how you feel about things or that your words are being \u201cwatched\u201d for how they apply to her, it\u2019s likely because she takes how you feel about things very personally. You\u2019re not the arbiter of worthiness. It\u2019s nice if she wants to please you but if she\u2019s feels totally destroyed by failing to make you happy, it\u2019s a problem. You can\u2019t dislike or disapprove of anything she does because she can\u2019t handle it. It subtly undercuts your boundaries because she takes all your boundaries to mean something is wrong with her when it\u2019s just a need you have personally.\n\n\nBut to boil all of those down, if she is not responsible for her own happiness and emotional peace of mind in her life, then she\u2019s gonna blame you for the lack of it and leave you for a reason that has nothing to do with you while thinking it is. And if you\u2019re like me, you will believe you were messing up or missing something and try to do it \u201cright\u201d when there was never a \u201cright\u201d way.\n\nIm sure there\u2019s more but these are ones I\u2019ve experienced.\n\nI\u2019ve accepted that no one can *\u201dmake\u201d* anyone else happy. Other people only do things that add to a happiness and appreciation that\u2019s already there. I don\u2019t want to be responsible for other people\u2019s well-being. I don\u2019t want my feelings and desires to be a means to an end to prove she is worthy or to make her feel validated. It\u2019s toxic and really leaves you with no options to help even if you wanted to. I know because despite being very attuned to their emotional needs, their inability to ask for help, meant me being perfect with emotions that weren\u2019t my own and it left me lost and confused about what I needed and what my boundaries were. It\u2019s like being a referee and a goalie for a soccer game.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s the women that need love and reassurance the most that push it away with their beliefs but if you try to give it to them you will only hurt yourself. You have to cut your losses and just leave those girls alone. If she doesn\u2019t love her life in the present moment then she really has no way to love you, authentically.\n\nLook for the girls who feels comfortable in her skin, understand what her needs are, and doesn\u2019t idealize you as some happiness, worthiness, or entertainment ATM. She has to be okay and accepting of outright asking for reassurance or a listening ear or insight if that\u2019s what she needs even if it\u2019s scary and vulnerable.\n\nIf you have thoughts or something to add, I\u2019d love to hear them."

                "body": "Hi! So my name actually translates to 'life' and I'm a bit short 5'2\" to be precise. I was born with tanned skin, dark brown downturned eyes and dark brown hair. I've got a round face and I'm a bit chubby, slightly baggy eyes.  \n\nI'm usually considered extroverted despite being a shy person, I do carry an air of confidence despite my shyness. I'm a very straight forward person because I don't like having two faces towards people which makes me a trustworthy person usually, sometimes I've had no choice but to keep up a persona but I only do this to avoid hurting people. One of the first things people would notice about me is my sense of humor and imagination. I'm also awkward in my way of speaking which is probably why I'm more shy.\n\nI'm into horror and true crime, I also really love fantasy and action adventure video games. I usually prefer to stay home rather than go around too much, I just feel more comfortable and more in my element at home. I recently discovered my aversion towards logical things (math, science, politics) and my preference towards philosophy and art, I used to like science as a kid but I grew to doubt my skills in those kinds of things. I love making up stories and editing to represent my stories visually, I find it better then writing 200 pages or something. \n\nI have a fear of heights, a very irrational one, I'm also scared of the pitch black dark and ghosts scare me probably due to all the horror films I watched. I'm not really an animal person although I love cats, sad thing is that I'm allergic to cats. I also hate having to be authentic or to silence myself when I have a problem with something, I prefer loyalty and honesty then to find people scheming behind me.\n\nTo go into more depth about my personality, I'm blunt and to the point. I tend to be in my own world though I have a strange six sense for gossip, I could hear them even if they were across the room. I'm not that great at reading the room, my friend told me I make jokes but at the wrong time. I'm not really temperamental, usually very calm but I can get aggressive when I'm provoked. I'm also known to be the mother of every group I've been in due to my protective nature.",

Let me explain.*\n\n**The affairs:** *every single affair Zeus has had resulted in a hero or a god such as Hermes, Apollo and Dionysus as an example. He's never had one with nothing useful or good coming out of it at all. Let's not forget Zeus was a god of fate and destiny so perhaps he might have known that all of those affairs would result in a hero? I don't blame Hera for being jealous but I doubt Zeus was really that bad. I don't think Hera would have put up with it otherwise. And no Zeus never got forceful on a woman, quite the opposite they all saw it as an honor, take Semele as an example the mother of Dionysus.* \n\n**Leadership:** *okay you may not all like him but we can't deny that Zeus was a pretty damn good leader. I mean Olympus was a literal mess when Hera, Poseidon, Apollo and Athena plotted a rebellion, without Zeus putting his foot down it gets chaotic. Let's not forget he plays mediator in a lot of situations as well. I don't think he would really keep his title or even earn it if he really were a bad leader but the thing is he simply wasn't. He was also willing to go into measures to keep himself as king probably knowing how much of a mess it would be without him.*\n\n*He's really villanized in modern media when we are all forgetting what time period all these myths take place and how different there values were compared to what we value in the modern age. I'm not calling him a saint because lets be real none of them were but he was never a villain planning to ruin everyones lives either. He just had to be the one to make all the tough calls and carry out the difficult choices to create a better future (cheating on Hera to create heroes is an example). He may not be perfect but he isn't horrible either. Thank you for reading my ted talk.*"

                "body": "I already know my perceiving functions Ne and Si but I'm starting to get confused about my judging because I'm starting to question if my values really are subjective or objective. I'll describe how I use my judging functions as well as I can.\n\nI get most of my values and ethics from my religion and I carry those ethics very strongly. It's not something I would betray. I have had times where I have also tried to encourage people who I know are in the religion to maintain them properly but I'm never forceful about it. Although one thing I found about myself is that I can get angry when someone opposes a value that really shouldn't be opposed such as respecting others or using racial slurs. It may not be my race but I still get taken a back because I learn to respect the external values around me and would never disrespect it. Despite that I did do something that would seem controversial to my cultural values but that was because I was pushed into the decision by my mother who also made me feel like it was a strict rule by our culture rather than a religious rule which made me start to not like it but that stopped and I learned to follow it again because I found evidence that her claims were false and now it's something I really love.  Some values I have are something my culture agrees with but not other cultures out there so I know not to preach about it or force anyone into it because I'm perfectly aware of the consequences and I encourage my outspoken friend who keeps preaching about it in the wrong environment to be aware of that. Despite that I'm not aware of every single social expectation out there in my culture which makes me come off a bit eccentric.\n\nAs for my thinking process I don't really research a lot before deciding to type someone which is a bad habit but instead I just remember what I read before and rule out which theory makes the most sense even making my own set of advice on self typing just based on my own observations and research rather than it being written anywhere. With things like maths for example I always need to understand what is going on and usually I make my own theories and methods separate to the teachers explanation that just make sense to me and usually work. Usually people prefer my system because it just makes the entire thing more easy although my method won't work for every single situation so I can find myself really panicking in exams because the teacher wanted us to practice her specific method so we could use it for harder problems in the exam but instead I just kept simplifying it all unknowingly sabotaging myself in the exam. I did do a lot of reading and research in order to understand MBTI which is what made me think I was a Te user. Although when I hear arguments from people I like to ask where the information is coming from because I feel like the information seems off, like it's false so I ask for the source to confirm what I was thinking which is another thing that made me think I was a Te user. \n\nNow before you type me:\n\nTe: objective logic\n\nTi: subjective logic\n\nFi: subjective values\n\nFe: objective values\n\nAnd be careful not to associate a certain value with a feeling, make sure you do that based on where the value is coming from rather than what the value itself is. Thank you."

                "body": "**Why are you interested in knowing your type?**\n\nplain curiosity that's all. I like the idea of narrowing down my strengths and weaknesses and using a framework despite it being not being scientific it continues to keep me intrigued. I started seeing it as both a hobby and a struggle when I really get enthusiastic. I suspect being an ENFP but I wanted some more external opinions about it though I know everything I say will be taken into account into finding my type which sounds both fun and difficult so sorry for troubling whoever is reading this right now. I always liked personality related things in the past but never really took it seriously until I got into MBTI and started really questioning myself midway through typing, simple curiosity turned into something a bit more deeper and that isn't exactly finding my type but the self-reflection it made me do and analyzing made me see myself in different perspectives I had never considered before which I found very intriguing but I would say that's the pseudo effect of MBTI. \n\n**Do you go to work and/or you in school? If so, what field/occupation/subjects?**\n\nI'm in school and as for my future it's a bit of a long story. It was straight-forward in my younger years being assertive of who I wanted to be and despite my laid-back attitude I definetly was hard-working and ambitious. I had a one-track mind for being in media for a long time and this continues even now to be my goal but I just keep changing the specific job although it's still very similar to what I wanted to be when I was younger. I wanted to be a journalist because I liked the aspect of writing stories in a dramatic way but then I turned my attention to film editing and writing novels instead of journalism. I also have a small interest in law that I know won't go that far which is why I don't focus on it but at first I was just attracted to the idea of logical debate and deduction but then as I got into it I found motivation through wanting the unbiased objective truth in court. Sometimes people are just too biased and swayed into a side just by dialogue when I believe you need to look at the evidence objectively and review it with no bias, that's what true justice is and that's what I love about it. But mainly I'll admit it's usually for logical deduction and debating because I found those things very attractive to me. If film-making or writing doesn't work out for me then I could give being a judge in court a shot because if I want to look at the objective truth than a prosecutor wouldn't be the best idea but a judge who would enforce that order is the type of position I would love. I developed film-making as a child out of idealization but that turned into a passion of showing a message visually. I enjoy making all those little details right though I'll admit I never plan what I'm going to make, the idea just pops up in my head and I go ahead and make it. Well that or I might see something that inspired it. As for writing I like script-writing because I have a very rushed pace of writing and I hate descriptive writing because it feels like very unnecessary details so I prefer to just get to the point instead.\n\n**Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nI definitely did have a religious upbringing but I honored the values that I was taught (the reasonable ones) but I had conflict when I disagreed with anything that feels a bit too much. In terms of structure I would say it had a mix. Although I was never given a single chore which is something I don't like nowadays because it would have been nice to learn how to take care of a house, it would only benefit me in the future when I go out in the world on my own although the structure came in when it came too studies and sometimes religion which again I respected and agreed with most of there requests which is the reason why they aren't too strict with me it's because they trust me enough to not do anything bad behind there backs which I wouldn't do. The worst I've done is leave the house without permission so I really did my best to follow all their wishes. I look back and wish I was given more structure and discipline and not so much freedom because that way I would learn the importance of responsibility and that is an important skill in the future. I ask that of them because I don't want to be in my thirties living in my mothers basement jobless, it's probably my worst nightmare.\n\n**Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nI'm not sure, I appreciate logic and usually want people to be objective but for logical consistency maybe when I'm in class being taught a method I would want to know all the steps for that method so that I can apply it when I'm doing the problem. I can't just use something I don't understand, as for people I don't really pay attention to it unless your in an argument where I probably would need that. I've used this in math classes always questioning why the specific method doesn't work and re-working it into a new method for each case scenario and analyzing what they have in common to make a signal for myself on when to use what method.\n\n**How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about?**\n\nI am very curious always wanting to know extra details in stories in order to envision the whole event and also about psychology as I find it very interesting yet confusing. I get many ideas but I don't usually execute them either by already knowing it won't go that far or just by seeing it wouldn't work after trying to do it. Most of my ideas are just story ideas usually either about fantasy or myserrty and I would say my tendency to want to get things over with fast is a big reason why I never finish books. I get tired of the slow process of writing especially if already envisioned the whole book in my brain so I find no reason to have to go and type it down when I already got my idea. Not planning the plot ends up keeping me motivated because there's no point of writing a story I already know exactly what happens in even though that's what I do when I make story plans.\n\n**If money was not an issue, what career/job would you have?**\n\nI would take either film-making or a judge in court. Film-making would allow me to spread a message that would help me make the world better or just spread entertainment in general although I never like showing my work publicly and get extremely embarrassed when a crowd watches anything I make. People go on about how I have potential with it and all but a proper film-maker shouldn't be afraid of showing there work. That would make the whole job pointless. As for a judge in court I would choose for the sole purpose of coming in and enforcing order and objective logic instead of getting to carried away with emotions. I could be the safety net that hold the court together from chaos or bias. I would also imagine myself being qualified for marketing because I do know how to strategize a practical plan and give the people what they want.\n\n**Are you a free spirit or do you play by the rules? If so, why?**\n\nI would say I'm a rule follower since I'm usually the one a bit more risk-averse and feel a strong sense of guilt when I break the rules I was specifically given but I can be a free-spirit when I find the rule unlawful although I don't know if I can provide any examples. \n\n**If I asked you to take a shot with a football how would that make you feel? Would you be able to do it well? Would you enjoy it?**\n\nWell first I would strategize the angle of the ball, the angle of my foot, which foot I'm using, the distance between me and the goal and the goalie themselves. I usually try to kick from the place that I think would work the most and attempt the angle it correctly most of the time but it doesn't always work. I basically make it into a physics session, I do this all the time in games that involve throwing, if I'm really focused on it. In terms of feelings it would depend on the setting, if you made me do it in live TV then of course I would feel anxious but if it's just some kick then I wouldn't mind. I do enjoy strategy so it makes the game more fun when I get the chance to plan out how it's going to work. \n\n**If I asked you to write me an essay, would you enjoy it? What would it be about? How would it make you feel?**\n\nIt depends on the topic, it would need to be about something I'm genuinely interested in. If I were to choose something it would be an analysis of a character and exploring why they do what they do. Coming with logical reasoning for there actions and looking at them in a new perspective, I would have a lot of fun in an essay like that because it would be about something I genuinely enjoy and I would feel proud if my essay was in depth so I probably would be striving for accuracy the whole time.\n\n**Is it okay to crack a few eggs? If it makes an omelette? Do the ends justify the means?**\n\nI would say it does depending on the context. A detective lying to get a confession sounds completely okay to me and I don't really understand people who get angry over this because whats more important is to get to the truth by any means but when it comes to things that aren't as important I would say otherwise. I don't like to go down those types of routes but I also understand a job needs to be done and I can't let my emotions get in the way of that although I'll admit even though I try to fight my emotions down they still find some way of stopping me from trying to work. \n\n**Do you put things back in their proper place?**\n\nNot usually, I don't really know how I'll go in detail about this but as organized as people tell me I am, I usually disagree because of this reason. \n\n**How do you behave around strangers, acquaintances and friends?**\n\nTo strangers I become very closed off, soft-spoken and polite not speaking unless spoken too so I can go for hours without saying a word to them until I get comfortable around them. I'm awkward with acquaintances not really sure on how to talk to them but more friendly then with strangers but I have a whole personality shift with my friends. I become more expressive, sociable and confident though I still keep that awkward nature of mine, I can act that way with almost anyone if I get comfortable around them but that depends on how much they want to listen too me. \n\n**Do you have exquisite tastes that you would expend effort or money for?**\n\nMy taste isn't like that, I'm definitely picky and have high standards usually but I wouldn't recklessly use my money over such a thing. Money is important for the long term future such as paying bills so I don't want to throw it on something short-term and unless like that. I admit I can get reckless about it sometimes though so I'm not always responsible about it, I just like to avoiding spending too much. \n\n**How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nI first ask myself if I can help them or not and if I can I jump into the opportunity and I would do this if I believe I can actually help you. I always think to myself \"well if it were me I would want this person too..\" so I just put myself in there perspective and figure it out. \n\n**How long do you take to make an important decision? How would you go about it? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nAn important desicon doesn't actually take to long, it's short term decisions that I do randomly such as where to sit at lunch or something like that. I can choose a future career, university and plan a job interview in advance easily but I can't for the life of me choose an outfit to wear when going out because I don't trust my style and taste. \n\n**If I asked you to design a plan of action, would it be easier to work alone or in a group? Do you ask for others opinion? or stick to your own guns?**\n\nI prefer to work alone because that would mean I wouldn't have to chase after everyone to ensure everyone is doing what their supposed to do and end up doing it for them last minute which usually always happens. I usually take charge for that reason unless I see someone better can lead but I still can't help but subtly lead anyways. I do ask for other opinion if I was in a group because they might have considered something better then I did so I give them a chance to say it. I then have everyone diplomatically vote on the idea and goodness why am I speaking as if it's an election. \n\n**A weekend best spent looks like ...?**\n\nA weekend where all my homework is done so I can just relax by myself just in my room alone. Me myself and I is the best company on a weekend. \n\n**My biggest fears are ...**\n\nFailure, I want make something from myself instead of dying alone or pathetic. I've always been competitive and that trait really stuck with me even now. My worst nightmare is being someone who's useless and dependent of everyone else which is why I try to teach myself organisation, responsibility and practicality because they would save me from such a fate. I also fear being trapped in a boring workaholic life with no breaks at all and only work work and work. \n\n**How much do you express yourself and what mediums do you do that through? Art? Writing? Talking?**\n\nI'm someone who expresses herself very subconsciously sometimes in art-work usually although it's very rare to do that. I would probably be stuck in art class and happen to be sad. Sometimes writing all my feelings helps me but I always cringe and delete it right after wondering what was I thinking?\n\n**Generally where do you lean politically? Is it every man for himself? Should people be pragmatic? Does the government need to step in and help people?**\n\nI feel like it's a strategic chess game where everyman is for themselves. Alliances is important because it would expand resources and in war you would be able to have a bigger army. Despite people not liking a government enforcing rules I actually respect that system because there should be a system enforced on people otherwise too much freedom equals chaos.\n\n**Does it matter if something is factually correct for you to believe in it?**\n\nNo, it has to be something correct. That's why I always ask about the sources for things I hear which makes me debate with my friends who have the dumbest theories ever. This is why I don't like those theories because they seem far from reality and just a crazy over thinker. Try to convince that the earth is round and I slap you for deciding to open your mouth in the first place. \n\n**Are emotions/feelings an important aspect of your life? If so, then why?**\n\nI would say they are very important because it makes me human. It gives me the passion to work for success but can get annoying when I'm trying to work but my emotions stop me from it. Their also very good when it comes to making connections with others which is something I am not very good at.\n\n**How attached are you to reality?**\n\nI'm defiantly much more in my head but I'm somehow a realist so in a way I'm a day realist. My realism is usually about how well I will do something and a comfort mechanism if I get insulted by trying to snap out of day-dreaming. \n\n**How thick skinned are you? Are you sensitive to criticism?**\n\nI can be either, I usually encourage harsh criticism because there just more effective than some nice crisitm by screeching about how good the work was."

                "created_utc": 1622213254.0,
                "body": "Thank you for taking the time to read this, I'm mainly suspecting ENFP for myself but I want to consider the other types as well. \n\nHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI'm 15, female and a student working hard for her dreams.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNo\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI definitely did have a religious upbringing and I respected the beliefs my parents taught me holding them closely to myself today. I did have an issue with some demands my father's made for me though but I later came to accept it. In terms of structured they never really gave me the chance to learn to be organized or self-reliant which is what I'm trying to improve in my teen years because I don't want to rely on everyone else and I want to learn to make my own life structure instead of everyone else doing it for me. They made me do some things routinely though such as studying for certain hours which made me hate studying because of how boring they made it for me but nowadays since I'm doing it independently I learned to genuinely enjoy work and exams rather than despise them. My mother gave me a lot of freedom though while my father kept trying to keep me under his structure, I preferred my mothers way doing things because she only gives me this freedom because she trusts I won't do anything reckless which I won't. \n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI'm still a high-school student but I aspire to either be a film-maker or work in law. I love film-making because I'm allowed to take my imagination and ideas and make them into something everyone can enjoy, I also hope to use that career to change the world through film-making somehow and spread an important message through my wacky imagination. The thing about law is because I want to contribute into making the world a fair place and making sure everyone looks at the objective truth and only the evidence instead of trying to read between the lines of the defendants emotional state. I wouldn't accuse someone of murder simply because they hate the person, I would do it based on concrete evidence only. I also got attracted to the logical debate part of all of it which is very fun for me as long as it isn't too heated or emotional. \n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI wouldn't mind as long as I have something to do, I kind of grew up mostly on my own so I learned how to entertain myself so I would feel relaxed but at the same time I would get bored if I can't talk to any friends that whole weekend. Mainly refreshed like in quarantine I was somehow the most happiest compared to my classmates who were desperate for interaction I went a whole year without missing interaction too much because I find I'm most calm when I'm on my own. \n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI usually prefer indoor activities such as video games, writing a plan for a story but never executing it because I already know what happens, swimming is fun when I get the chance, cycling with music and making weird voice-overs and deleting whatever cringe comes up. I'm not a fan of sports anymore because of high competition and people screaming at you over every single thing you get wrong just feels horrible so it sucked out the fun. But I do enjoy football, boxing, dance, swimming and cycling. \n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nMy curiosity is usually asking about peoples reactions to things (when someone tells me that they said something about me to someone I usually ask for that other persons reaction to it) or answering questions to understand a theory better (like MBTI I try to understand the entire theory by answering questions I have about it). My ideas I would say are a little random as I randomly see connections to things which give me weird ideas. I can't really tell if their conceptual of environmental though but I can definitely think of both. I usually disregard the idea if I see I can't really do anything with it or if I come up with something better. \n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI definitely do enjoy playing leader in a group because I know how to get there thoughts organized and I know what we would need to do to accomplish the goal. Although I'm not as pushy with people who I'm not comfortable with but it's the opposite with my friends as with them I push them to get things done in certain times and if I see there not preforming up to my standards I go into \"if people can't do it I'll do it myself\" which I do either way even if I'm not comfortable enough to be pushy I will still probably do your work if I see your not doing it well enough or in time. If I'm good at it or not is more of a subjective thing, I would say I'm decent but I won't take the role if I see someone who is more capable of leading but I definitely contribute a lot. My leadership style is more of delegating tasks to the group and keep them focused on what there given but I tend to catch myself doing there work for them if I see they didn't do enough. I don't like people who are going to do it last-minute. Just do it at the time you were given instead of something lazy in the night before, your laziness shouldn't effect the entire group. I definitely work harder in groups because of the reason that I feel the team needs me to do my best in order for everything to thrive. \n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nWell I only just learned how to be organized after I got worried about failing everything I set out to do because of that lack of organization although nowadays my friends call me the back-bone of organization which I'm not really used to. I'm good at organizing work and tasks but not things like my room. Although I have tried to organize my bags I always find someone ruining my entire system and I get frustrated because my system is just easier. I normally have a messy room but I can still find things when I need them and I don't bother to organize it if it's just going to be messy again. I don't usually enjoy working with my hands but there are things I like such as cooking which is a very hands on thing and I used to like putting things together and diy when I was younger but that interest died out a long time ago. \n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nNope, I really hate art class because I'm not allowed to draw what I want in my own way. I have to use there detailed method and it just sucks out the fun. And I'm competitive so I hate having my art compared to someone who does better. I just doodle whatever when I'm bored which is the closest to me being artistic. I can appreciate art and I love realistic art with oil paint that has a bit of a twist to it like something abstract about it that's just eye-catching and makes you question why its there and I appreciate the visually aesthetic artworks.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nThe past is something I just want out of here, I don't like to look back on it and I barley do because I don't usually remember good things but at the same time when I get to know someone me telling them past stories means I'm opening up to them no matter how good or bad. The present is just the present, I don't have any particular feelings to it other than just live it. The future seems to me to be something I need to prepare and plan for, I picked out which specific university I should go to with my area of interest when I was seven and I stuck to that vision although I started planning back up universities and careers if my first plan fails. I get excited about the future because I find it to be brighter and when I'm actually allowed to go out in the world and be an adult, pay bills, be responsible of my self, have a job I hopefully enjoy. I'm more focused on being a career woman before ever thinking of being in a relationship. Hell I even devoted myself not getting into a single relationship (no dating or nothing) until I establish myself as a career woman with a stable financial plan and I'm in an old enough age. Then I can start to think about settling down but until then my main focus is the harder side of being an adult, I fear not being prepared enough which is why I really push myself in high-school.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI usually hear them out first to see if it's anything I would be able to do, I usually agree to help if I can but there are issues people need to deal with on there own. Although I get exhausted when someone gives me a major emotional problem but at the same time I do my best to help. I usually help them because it just feels like the nice thing to do, I only help when I think to myself 'If I were in there shoes, would I want that to happen too me' which I know seems very Fi of me already. \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI haven't really thought about that so I don't really know...\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nVery, I do slack off I admit it but it is a skill I'm really aiming to improve especially since it will really impact how well I'll do in life. I usually get my assignments done and I made a checklist for everything but this is very recent though. Before I used to be queen of 'do it last minute' but after I started to learn the outcome of not having this skill I don't do any task last minute anymore. Even in vacations I can't really enjoy it anymore because I get eager about doing all my assignments and being ready in advance. I get extremely annoyed in group projects when someone isn't working or doing enough which is a trait I had even when I was a person who usually did things last minute. So I end up doing their entire part angrily while going in a rant about there lack of efficiency. I used to scare my friends whenever I look at there work because they feel like I'm a teacher grading an exam when I do that, I guess my death stare and silence doesn't help either.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI don't really know, sorry\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI really enjoy film-making and writing because I'm allowed to build a story with my own rules. But I enjoy the result of my film-making more than the process and it's when I have to focus on all the little details and edit them to make sure that my story is in my vision. I plan stories but not films, I just work on the details halfway but it all starts with a spark of an idea.\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI really hate classes where I have to memorize a method like math, I'm not against classes that rely on memorization though because I can genuinely enjoy it but the difference is that in math I like finding my own solutions to problem and have my own logical reasoning I develop, it's more fun that way. Memorizing methods on the other hand sucks out the fun especially if their detailed. But subjects my best subject is on heavily relying on memorization and my other two are all about analysis and thinking about things in a new perspective. So I prefer classes that let me explore my own solutions rather than enforcing them on me such as math.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI would say I'm a decent strategist. I tend to improvise in projects but I'm different in group projects. I start giving everyone specific assignments to get the job done faster. \n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nmy main aspiration is making the world have a more fair system and focous on real issues rather than minor things. I don't really like it when people go crazy over minor issues when there are more important things in the world. I want to basically put more emphasis on human rights when it comes to law and making sure to look at both sides with no bias at all. I also wish to make the education system actually teach you to be organized in your younger years to prepare you properly for the world and teach us things we will need as adults like in math I would like to focus on finances because thats how you'll utilize math in the future or in English we should focus on the language itself. For history we could look to see how those methods can be used to help us today. I just want to make the world a better place and become a successful career woman. I would much rather rely on myself when I do all of this because I grew not having the chance to just rely on myself. \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nMy biggest fear is failure, becoming nothing at all and never making it in life. I know inevitably if I never put the effort I may end up like that. Even if I do there's always that possibility in the back of my mind. My reason for fearing failure is because I feel like my purpose in life is success, doesn't mean it's inevitable or I'm destined for it but its more of my drive to live. I'd rather be miserable but successful than a happy failure. It's what drives me to work hard in life, and I learned how to make working fun instead of miserable. I also have a fear of being controlled by people, I have a lot of conflict with people when I feel like I'm being controlled by them. I want to make my own future rather than having people decide that for me. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nin my highest I become energetic usually after hanging out with friends in a fun environment, I get excited when I see good results from hard-work and I really enjoy it when I find myself overcoming problems like when I find myself really good at certain math equations I find myself energized and happy. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nI find myself frantically working and trying to organize my life, becoming a workaholic and uncharacteristically sensitive. Feeling unprepared can really mess me up when it's something I really care for. Sometimes bad memories and reminders of past trauma can make me really low for a little but I get over it fast. \n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI definitely day-dream most of the time but I am aware of my surroundings in a way, but I'm just more focused on my own thoughts as I look at my environment. It might make me look like an Se user because I keep watching everything but I'm not really paying attention. \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nThat sounds like tourture but I would imagine myself reflecting about my life and probably strategizing on ways to get out of that room. My brain would try to entertain me through day-dreaming but I would still try to get out. \n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI actually find I'm very decisive when it comes to important decisions but indecisive with minor decisions like what to wear but I can easily choose a university and occupation.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nFirst thing I try to do is try to ignore it if it's a bad emotion but let myself feel if it's good. I try to keep emotional stability otherwise how would I live a healthy normal life. And also it gets in the way when it comes to my productivity so I try to utilize it as a tool in that context. For example when I need to work on a assignment that's important I basically just motivate my emotions by promising a reward in the end (lunch for example, I did not let myself eat until the task was done using the lunch as a reward...you can already see the lack of Si) \n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nNot really, I actually find rules very important. But I just break rules that I find unnecessary like banning me for wearing a jacket in school but I still wore it anyways because it made me more comfortable and it was cold. I don't think authority should be challenged unless it's actually a corrupt system but usually the law is something people review and fairly place and developed so I tend to actually respect the law and even aspire to work in law. There needs to be a system to stop us from going crazy at the end of the day, like how I view as the financial system being fair because it's not like earth has enough resources to feed eight billion people so if we limit people from buying things like 200 toilet paper a day then it saves more for the other eight billion."

I broke up but i still feel love for her and i dont know if that makes sense.\n\nIt started at a halloween party at her place. I was invited trough friends and she got my attention and we seemed to have a good connection. She was in a relationship though, so i didnt flirt too much bit i guess enough that her partner got jealous and almost started a fight with me, i kept calm.\n\nFew months later i hear that she got pregnant and few months later again the whole friends group is meeting again and she is talking about how she is breaking up with the guy ( she talks about how unreliable he is and he went to a different country).\n\nShe got her child and when we saw each other,we have a connection obviously and her female friend also pushes me to get in contact with her.\n\nI told her from the start that im not interested in a relationship but she insists that she also doesnt want a relationship and just want to enjoy the time with me.

I can send you a great webinar I attended to if you don't want to hire anyone. It only teaches the basics of creating a good website, but it's a precursor to their more comprehensive course. Not sure if I can recommend their course though... havent been in it yet. Still, I find the free webinar to be useful.\n\nTo sum up the webinar though... Use Wordpress then download the Elementor plug-in for the drag & drop. Like what the other dude said... Google domains is prolly better. I find that web domain & email addresses are linked... so it'll be easy to integrate into Gmail ig. \n\nMy focus is more on the fashion industry, but I think this tip may help you. Build your brand identity if you want to build your business image. If you're really not working on increasing sales, it's still a better move to \"connect\" with your audience, like which values do you two share? and stuff like that.

Honestly, you don't need to prove your diagnosis to other people, but of course you'd want to double check on yourself. If you've ever doubt your diagnosis, perhaps it's helpful to ask... \"would other people also feel these symptoms if they were just inspired/happy/angry/sad?\"\n\nEmotions and moods are fleeting, but mood **states** are not as fleeting. You can have a depressive episode even when you're not \"sad\", likewise with hypomanic and mixed episodes. Episodes/Mood states are long (4 days \"minimum\" for hypomania, and 2 weeks for depression, as listed in DSM), intense, and can affect your ability to \"function\" as a human being.\n\nAnyways, if you don't doubt your diagnosis, then great!

(I turn them all off)\n- **Headphones:** The option to wear headphones in normal working scenarios with white noise, lo-fi or similar sounds.\n- **Notes**: The option to take notes either digitally or with a paper and pen in all meetings.\n- **Breaks**: The option to split up my lunch break into smaller breaks and spread them more evenly throughout the day.\n- **Location**: The option to be near a window. As the air conditioning can really affect my focus level if its too hot or humid.\n\n\nThere\u2019s not a guarantee you\u2019ll get all of them, but it\u2019s worth asking, and they still wouldn\u2019t know you have ADHD (if you don\u2019t mention it).\n\nYou can maybe mention how you have a lot more control over these things at home, especially the breaks and window location.",

And there's also the possibility that there exists a completely different mind-blowing explanation that neither you, nor I, nor the police are smart enough to even think of.\n\nLook the probability of your brain materialising with all it's thoughts and memories in a chaotic universe of particles just randomly bumping into each other is estimated at 1 in 10\\^(10\\^69). If you want to talk about 100%, then you have to account for stuff like that, which you can't. Granted in that scenario, there'd be no risk because the guy your sentencing doesn't actually exist but it's just a nice quantifiable example. There would be many many things like that, that you would never even consider because their probability is so small but can completely explain away any material evidence.\n\nTo be clear I'm not worried about these things in practice. I'm perfectly comfortable with such low risk levels, even around killing innocent people. My real issue is that even if you have some intuitive level of acceptable risk, this is not as well-defined as you are making it out to be.\n\nSpeaking in more practical terms, how do you know when you're inside a case that it's one of the ones that really is open and shut, not one of the one's that appeared to be.",

Maybe it was an extremely similar looking person, or a long lost identical twin.\n\nOr, hey if you are looking for non-zero possibility then 1 in a 10\\^10000000000 will do it. So maybe they just guessed completely at random where the body was and it just happened to be there. Maybe the CCTV had some magnetic disturbance which just happened to form what appeared to be an image of the defendant doing the murder.\n\nThe problem with \"100%\" is it doesn't exist in reality. There is evidence that is 99.999%, some may have a longer decimal trail and others a shorter but it stops somewhere.\n\nThose scenarios I gave are unreasonable to consider, they certainly don't fit a reasonable doubt standard. But here's the thing, how would you ever convey a sensible threshold to jurors where it's \"as near to 100% that you might colloquially call it 100%. But also, you know, don't be silly about it\"? If we have a \"reasonable doubt\" standard and that's not enough, then you must have a separate \"reasonable doubt, but really probably have a slightly looser definition of the word reasonable than you're generally inclined to bc we might kill the guy\" and it seems naive to expect jurors to be able to understand the difference between those two.\n\nFurthermore such a high standard, if you could genuinely implement it, would lead to the vast majority of death-sentence cases (i.e. the worst crimes of all) not meeting the evidentiary standard and being acquitted. The alternative is to ask jurors to make two judgements on two proof-standards, one to determine if they should be imprisoned for life and the other to determine if they should be killed. So, in many cases we'd be sending people to jail for life while giving a verdict that \"but we're not completely sure though, they might be innocent\". It's fucked up whichever way you slice it.",

Why is this so much more ok than when it comes to the death sentence?\n\nI think the only reason we are more uncomfortable when it comes to death is because we would have to know the names of some of the people we had done it to wrongly.

We know all sorts of things about what life events might contribute to anxiety disorders, depression, eating disorders, not to mention many non-mental health related medical conditions too. But we don't apply them as diagnostic criteria because the symptoms are enough, they are what define people's experience of the disorder and they are the reason they need help. But with PTSD, even if you have every symptom; chronic flashbacks, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response and the whole shabang, if what happened to you wasn't \"bad enough\" then you still don't have PTSD, so go fuck yourself I guess?\n\nBut what I find most ironic of all is that the one and only disorder we choose to do this with also has one very significant major symptom: lost memories. So basically, you won't remembered what happened, but also you have to be able to say exactly what happened to get diagnosed. And also if your PTSD stems from a period where you were too young to even retain memories that you might at least have a potential of un-repressing e.g. if you were abused as a baby or toddler, then better get ready for a life with undiagnosed PTSD.\n\nIt is so unnecessary, it is so easy to diagnose by symptoms. It honestly makes me angry because it feels like gate-keeping, very easy to get diagnosed if you've been shot at in a war as an adult. Very difficult if you have hazy memories of your parents being cruel to you. Maybe it's my tendency to take things personally, but sometimes it feels like a deliberate effort to gatekeep who does and doesn't get to use the word PTSD based on whether they are seen as worthy."

I have planned the following set up, but I'd love some feedback if there's something you'd recommend changing to make it better:\n\nDemon: Imp\n\nMinion: Scarlet Woman\n\nOutsiders: Recluse, Drunk Investigator\n\nTownsfolk: Chef, Empath, Fortune Teller, Virgin, Mayor\n\nBluffs: Librarian, Slayer, Saint\n\nI was going to have fortune teller and mayor for the drunk investigator's pings and show them as the poisoner to discredit good info. And empath as the fortune teller's red herring\n\nI'm kind of torn on the bluffs. I put in librarian and slayer to give the minion two potential ways to back up the saint claim, but I'm considering switching one out for an each-night (i.e. monk or undertaker) to give the demon a decent bluff if they don't fancy saint."

There are a lot of things that happened to me that weren't normal, but even some parts of my childhood that seem perfectly \"normal\" (i.e. commonplace), at least for the time I grew up in, feel extremely traumatic to me. And I look back at the childhoods that we all had and I think of all the children experiencing the people that they fundamentally relied on to love and care for them deliberately using their bodies to force them to experience physical pain because they had decided they \"deserved it\". And it baffles me that people are ok with that having happened to them.\n\nI asked my therapist \"why is everyone ok?\". She said \"I don't think they are\". I said \"but most people genuinely are relatively fine, most people don't have CPTSD, most people just casually talk about humiliating and painful experiences from their childhood and laugh or at least don't care at all. How can they act like that child that they used to be doesn't matter? Why has everyone stopped caring, and yet I still feel every bit of pain that child felt?\" She said \"it's because you refused to leave yourself behind.\"\n\nI don't know if that resonates with anyone else but it really clicked for me. I always thought that I must somehow be particularly weak because I was more badly affected by things than most people would be and I didn't understand what was wrong with me compared to everyone else.\n\nBut I believe so strongly that that child doesn't deserve to be forgotten. She mattered and she deserves for someone to believe that, even if it's only me. The idea of mocking her pain and joining the side of the people who hurt her so that I don't have to hurt anymore is abhorrent to me. I don't want to leave myself behind, I don't want to say it didn't matter. I want to scream that it wasn't right, it wasn't ok and it never will be."

I always wanted him to feel like it was no big deal, just another clever part of this amazing body that belonged to him.\n\nOne time a couple of months ago I was changing him and it was a major poo explosion that was all over everything and as I was leaning over to grab the wipes I saw out of the corner of my eye his hands going to his penis and I shouted \"no!\" just because I panicked and I wasn't thinking straight. His little face crumpled up with a look of complete devastation and he wailed such a sad cry it broke my heart. I cuddled and cuddled him and told him I wasn't angry and he hadn't done anything wrong. Ever since then he still says \"penis!\" when he sees his penis but then he follows up with \"no touch it\" and when I say \"you can touch it if you'd like to\" he always says \"no\".\n\nFor context, when there is a rule he knows or we've warned him not to do something dangerous, he always reminds us what the rule is when he sees that thing. So \"no touch it\" is also what he says if he sees a plug socket or a knife or a thorny bush etc. It's him letting me know that he remembers what he's not supposed to do.\n\nI wish he would just go back to how he was before. I don't care if he wants to touch it or not, and it seems inappropriate to actively encourage him to, but I wish I could just take back that stupid insensitive moment and let him know that it's all ok."

                "body": "I don't know about you guys, but for me the major problem the game has isn't really the balancing of cultures. It's the lack of \"personalities\" the game has. I'm referring to those persona options that change your character's voice and animations.\n\nThe addition of the immersive names was cool, but I still feel I'm not playing against a \"leader\", mainly because every single one of them talks the same way and say the same things, and to make it worse everything is so exaggerated that:\n1. It seems thet even they don't take what they are saying seriously\n2. They don't have a real personality\n\nI know comparing isn't ideal but, for example, the civilization 6 leaders all have different voices and animations and it gives them the feel of being real. The \"gilgabro\" thing comes mostly from the interaction you have to the leader himself rather than with his empire and is a big thing for the community. Most of the civilization characterization there comes from the leader's personalities rather then the specific civ playstyle.\n\nI think some things that could improve this in humankind are:\n\n1.The addition of new personalities: it says for itself\n\n2. Animation/voice options within the same personality: if, let's say, the \"joyful\" personality had a set of voice lines/ animations/ voice actors that you could choose to further improve your customization\n\n3. Different languages: It would be awesome to choose a language for your leader. Imagine if the personality \"x\" had it's voicelines available in English, French and Maori for you to choose, and the personality \"y\" had Portuguese, Spanish and Latin as voice options. That would give some diversity to the game without having to dubb everything in every language\n\n4. Historical personas with their own personality: Just having event/specific personas that have an entire personality of their own would already a great step into the \"not feeling I'm playing against an empty shell\" thing.\n\nI don't know the feeling of the community about this, as I'm not really used to using reddit, but I got really excited with the new update until I thought \"oh, the exciting politics will be ruined by the persona's lack of uniqueness\". I really love the game and I want it to be better \ud83e\udd17"

                "body": "Well, idk if having 1000 theory about life per week is an ADHD thing, but it's a me thing.\n\nSo there's time in which I'm just the best, I can do everything, talk to everyone ( yes because most of the time I hyperfix myself on how to produce voice, how to talk, my tone, my pronunciation and stuff, which restrein me from talking correctly)\n\nMaybe you can relate to that\n\nSo yeah there's time like that, and there's time like I'm just the dumbest, incompetentest person on earth. And this is the fact that I have no control and no idea on how to switch on my \"super-me\" mode.\n\nBut I did notice, after years of self searching, that I feel a tingly, something in me when I'm in the super-me mode.\n\nAnd I spent years, every day (and I'm not exaggerating: EVERY SINGLE DAY) theorizing on what was that feeling, how was it related to my super-mode... Do other people experience that? If so, do they notice it, do they have it all the time and it's just me who's just a dumbass?\n\nI thought about the fact that it could be awareness, then I thought about energy, and a lot of other things: micro awareness, muscle memory, nerves endings, neurotransmitter sensors, qi, chi, prana, point of pression, MBTI cognitive functions, Mushing no shin....add just thousands of wacky theories to that\n\n (the good thing about it all was all the information I got over this giant hyperfixation, that's surely how I came to conclude I had ADHD, and needed diagnostic)\n\nAnyway, this thing could not be energy, or high energy, I couldn't depend on my energy level just to speak correctly and make friends.\n\nSo today I sat, grabbed a bear, and started to reflect on myself:\n\nWhy? How? What's the common denominator?\n\nWhat's that feeling that allow me to dance and Sing like a rockstar?\n\nThen It hit me:\n\nThis feeling is Life! The very concept of it.\n\nLife.\n\nSomething large enough to englobe everything going on in my life from my actions to the simple control of my body.\nSomething so basic that I use it unconsciously a times.\n\n\nI have to add Life to the sauce.\n\nAnd now that I think of it, teachers did told me to put \"life in my character\" in theater classes.\n\nPutting life into my character, idk if it's true, but I'm just going to test it.\n\nI'll keep you informed (if I remember)\n\nLIFE!"

There\u2019s a lot of gestures I can think of that just show love - asking how your day was, asking if you ate, paying attention to what is going on in their life that doesn\u2019t necessarily relate to you but is important to them, generally just being respectful not just to them but to everyone, spending time together that isn\u2019t just for the purpose of sex. Some guys seem to think it kills the mood for some reason but consent is sexy - it makes me feel loved and cared for when he checks in on me and asks if I want to stop or if what he\u2019s doing is okay. Imo a really gentle, sweet, and caring personality is super attractive - I say fuck the \u2018macho alpha man\u2019 bullshit\n\nAs far as physical things go, a lot of it depends on the individual\u2019s preference of course. Hygiene is a pretty universal thing though. I don\u2019t particularly like big muscley guys and find a more lean and toned look more attractive, but my best friend\u2019s taste is the complete opposite for example. Some of my personal things I find attractive in men are height (I\u2019m kind of a sucker for the idea of the \u2018gentle giant\u2019 lol), nice sweaters, longer curly + more natural looking hair, leaner and toned body type as I mentioned, tanner/more sun-kissed skin, and clean shaven",

Checking device manager the phone shows up as a, \"USB composite device\" and gives the status, \"This device cannot start. (Code 10) A device which does not exist was specified\".\n\nI've tried everything I can think of to fix this issues. So far I've, uninstalled the device driver, checked for updated drivers on windows update, tried different USB ports / cables(2.0 3.0 3.1), tried file transfer mode, PTP mode, toggled USB debugging on and off, restarted both devices about a million times, did all my windows updates. I tried following a guide about deleting high and low filters in the registry but I'm completely missing the class for the GUID in the registry.\n\nAlso, for whatever reason, the phone works fine on my wife's computer.\n\nSo at this point, I'm stumped. Anyone have any suggestions?\n\nBecause it might be relevant, I'm using a Gigabyte X470 MB and the phone is a Moto Edge+ 2022."

I'm having a really hard time deciding because  both of these phones are exceptional in different ways and they directly address the weaknesses of each other. I like the Xperia because  the camera is on a different level and the overall user experience is  great on it, but I like the Moto because the cell/wi-fi reception is fantastic(far better than my old Samsung or the Sony on the same cellular bands) the phone handles the 8 gen 1 flawlessly(seriously incredible cooling on this thing) and the big screen is kind of nice.\n\nTo  summarize my dilemma here in as few words as possible, the Xperia is  more enjoyable to use, but the Moto performs better as a phone. I'm  having a hard time deciding which of these is more important. Neither phone is so compromised in any area that it doesn't work for my use case, but there is a stark contrast between them. The Xperia offers a far better camera and more QOL features, but it's constantly hot and it overheats during extended camera use. The Moto is a much more bland  phone, but it's an absolute work horse and you can flog the crap out out  of it and it just asks for more.\n\n**Which  of these 2 would you guys go with and what do you think is more  important in the long term, user experience or functionality?**\n\nSmall  note, I've bought 2 Motos from Amazon and both were dirty inside the  box. They were both supposedly brand new and sold by Amazon. So I don't  know if this indicates a QC issue at Motorola or Amazon being scum bags  and selling me used phones as new. Either way, it makes the Sony seem  even more premium by comparison. Both Motos have worked fine despite  looking dirty out of the box."

                "body": "I'm sorry if this question has been asked to death(no pun intended) but I'm 21, about to enter college(had mental health complications in HS), and have a tested IQ in the 160s(actual test, not online). I want to help people to the best of my ability and have thought maybe EMT or Paramedic. And while the idea is greatly tempting, I want to help even after death, I figure, people with an IQ comparable to mine have made tremendous strides in the physical sciences, so maybe I could do something good as well(obviously with enough drive and disciple etc).\n\nI want to go into political science to write papers and theses on political philosophy, in hopes that my work may inspire future generations to improve people's lives like John Locke, Plato, John Stuart Mill, etc. and I want to go into storytelling because I believe art is incredibly important when it comes to helping people, I myself being able to get out of a rut due to a work of fiction when countless medications and hospital visits failed. But I'm afraid that won't be hands-on enough to make me really feel like I'm doing anything at all.\n\nI want to go into something that can truly utilize the potential I possess due to my IQ, and obviously any IQ can work any job, but we'd be lying if we said certain jobs are more suited for higher IQ individuals than others(astrophysics, surgery, etc). I thought maybe a surgeon, they are often the highest IQ individuals in the medical field, save lives every day, and often create research papers to improve the field for decades to come, and are quite literally as hands-on as you could possibly get. Sounds perfect, but my hands are far too shaky for surgeon work(they aren't like Parkinsons shaky but they are by no means still), and I've always had trouble just standing for worship in church(about 2 hours for non-Christians) let alone the average 19+ hours a surgeon does, and I don't think I could actually deal with the stress of the job.\n\nWhile I'm willing to go into a field I'm not super passionate about for the sake of helping others, there are of course limits to that, my friend suggested working on alternative fuel sources but quite honestly, chemistry is probably the only academic I really struggled with. If you believe in the whole MBTI thing I should note I'm pretty sure I'm an INFJ(I've looked into the dichotomies, and the type functions and all that and it still seems to fit me best) which are usually more satisfied with things like social work, teaching, or activism, just to give a sort of idea of the kind of person I am.\n\nI know it's kind of a long shot expecting anyone to read this or even give good advice but I figured I can at least try. Whenever I bring this up with others they kind of just blow it off as nothing more than a minor inconvenience for me but truthfully it keeps me up at night and I've been devoting a lot of my time to thinking about this. \n\nBefore anyone says anything about it, I'm not bragging or flaunting my IQ, I only bring it up because I feel it is relevant to the topic. And I know IQ isn't everything, it just covers how much you can remember, retention, and how quickly you can learn new things, obviously drive, discipline, and dedication are what matter most. I'm also not looking to argue about whether IQ tests are effective etc, if you think they aren't that's fine, but I'm not really here to argue that. Just asking for suggestions on careers for helping people.(I'm sorry if this comes off as dismissive or combative, just figured I'd state all that before someone gets mad at me about it). \n\nPlease try not to be too harsh, I'm rather sensitive to criticism"

I decided not to though but i forgot to plug the camera back in. She realized i had unplugged it, and assumed i did so to get alcohol from downstairs. I understand why she thought this, because around this time last year I had drank a full bottle of wine (idiotic i know). I tried to explain the actual situation and she explained that even though she wants to trust me she can\u2019t.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I have to be such a horrible child. I\u2019m so young and I\u2019ve done so many horrible things. I thought I would be better this year but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m sorry, I am 14 and I am not diagnosed but this subreddit is very comforting to me and I feel like I probably have BPD.\n\nI know this part is selfish but what makes it even worse for me is that my FP isnt responding to me right now. I split on them so much yesterday, but before we went to bed we had a really nice conversation. She also talked a bit to me today too. I bet they are probably sleeping right now but i need them. I have so much negative emotions and I literally can\u2019t get them out, its all just bubbling inside me and makinf me overwhelmed and uncomfortable.\n\nHonestly I don\u2019t know why i even wrote this, i wojld really like some sort of comfort to be honest."

I feel embarrassed because of how much I suck at school, guilty for breaking up with my gf, and angry and jealous at the people in my class who seem to be so carefree. How do they just talk to people without feeling anxious? How do they not constantly want to kill everyone surrounding them? I don\u2019t know. I just wish I was normal. I hate having responsibilities. If I could I would just lie in bed all day, but I have my mom to wake me up and drag me to school. I\u2019m grateful for her of course, but sometimes I wish I could just let life waste away. I want life to be better, and if it can\u2019t be then I don\u2019t want it.

He begins trimming his beard and paying more attention to his looks.

                "body": " \n\nThere are several reasons why Shrek is a better movie than Avatar.\n\nFirst, Shrek has a more relatable and likable protagonist. While Avatar's main character, Jake Sully, is a heroic figure, he is also flawed and makes mistakes throughout the movie. On the other hand, Shrek is a complex and fully-developed character who undergoes a transformative arc throughout the film. Shrek starts out as a solitary and grumpy ogre, but he learns to open up and become more vulnerable as he embarks on a journey to save the princess and reclaim his swamp. As a result, Shrek is a more relatable and likable character than Jake Sully, which makes for a more enjoyable viewing experience.\n\nSecond, Shrek has a stronger and more compelling narrative. While Avatar has an interesting premise \u2013 a disabled man is sent to a distant planet to serve as an avatar for a native species \u2013 the story ultimately becomes predictable and formulaic. In contrast, Shrek has a unique and well-crafted story that is full of twists and turns. The movie seamlessly combines elements of fantasy, adventure, and romance to create a rich and engaging world that keeps viewers invested from start to finish.\n\nThird, Shrek has better animation and special effects. While Avatar is certainly a visual masterpiece, its CGI effects can sometimes feel excessive and over-the-top. In contrast, the animation in Shrek is more subtle and understated, which helps to ground the movie in a sense of realism. The character designs are also more detailed and expressive, which adds depth and personality to the film.\n\nFourth, Shrek has a stronger supporting cast of characters. While Avatar has a diverse and talented cast of supporting characters, they are often underdeveloped and one-dimensional. In contrast, the supporting characters in Shrek \u2013 including Donkey, Fiona, and the Fairy Godmother \u2013 are fully realized and play a crucial role in advancing the story. Each character has their own distinct personality and motivations, which helps to create a more dynamic and believable world.\n\nFinally, Shrek has a better overall message and theme. While Avatar has a positive message about environmentalism and preserving indigenous cultures, it ultimately feels preachy and heavy-handed. In contrast, Shrek has a more universal and relatable theme about the importance of acceptance and self-worth. The movie teaches viewers that it's okay to be different and that everyone has value, no matter what they look like or where they come from. This message is conveyed in a subtle and nuanced way, which makes it more impactful and memorable.\n\nOverall, there are many reasons why Shrek is a better movie than Avatar. From its likable and well-developed protagonist to its compelling narrative and strong supporting cast, Shrek is a timeless classic that continues to captivate and entertain audiences of all ages."

It\u2019s just part of your minds adjustment process. Give it a day or two and chances are it\u2019ll stop completely in its tracks, as it did for me.

I\u2019m starting to get lines on my lips and I\u2019m also prone to getting lip freckles. I\u2019m hoping to find a good one that I won\u2019t mind wearing daily and that will hopefully work beneath other lip products. I\u2019m also wanting one that is at least spf 30. Thanks!"

You're letting his boyfriend know, but even if he was \"one of his best friends\"... this is your family! That's different.  \n\n\nThere's a concept in psychology about [circles of closeness](https://www.ldw.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Relationship-Circles.pdf). The people who are closest to the deceased are the most entitled to their grief and being messy. they don't have the spoons necessary to comfort people who are on circles farther out.   \n\n\nIf you have say, one person who is a family member of the deceased, and another who is a long time friend, it's usually very bad etiquette for the friend to show more emotion and distress than the family member. But even if they do feel worse... it's better manners to not mention it, so that the person who is closer or \"higher\" in social status doesn't feel like they are being made to do emotional labor for the other person of lower status.  \n\n\nIt can get murky when there are romantic feelings involved, but I'm pretty sure it was poor form of that friend to mention to YOU specifically that he doesn't want to cry in front of his parents. You are the family of the deceased and you are doing your own grieving, it's not the right time for that person to look to you for ANY sympathy of any kind - you're dealing with your own grief.",

They're trying to scrape through the day doing the bare minimum, but they already came to the job setting the expectations low, being cheerful, fun, social, making people feel good and then just bullshiting on results and trying to fart-arse their way to Friday 5pm.  \n\n\nThe thing is, if you want to drop your technical effort down so that people don't notice, you're going to have to amp up the socialization aspect of your work so that you can suck ass, make people feel really good about you, so that in their minds they just gloss over your lower productivity because you're one of the good ones.   \n\n\nThe reason you get passed over for promotions even though you're killing it on the results is because people hate you for killing it on the results... the people in your workplace hate you for highlighting the fact that they suck in comparison to you. Especially on low wage jobs!   \n\n\nThe next job you take, if it's just a paycheck to you, and you're not actually passionate about it, just act like you're brimming with enthusiasm and suck up to your colleagues and bosses. Then do as little as possible: up to and including jack shit. Don't EVER set expectations high for the benefit of bosses who honestly are fucking lazier than you are.

But because of those assumptions, women aren't just condescended to, they are offered less pay, not respected by their colleagues and distrusted more by customers. you can look at the study that was done into the public perception female pilots versus male pilots for an example.\n\nI would ask that men who care about avoiding unconscious discrimination, ask themselves whether they would respect and trust a man more in this situations automatically, and consciously be more equitable in their mindset. Conversely, I think that male early childhood educators suffer from a similar issue, and because I'm aware that sexism hurts everyone, whenever I catch myself being distrustful of a male early childhood educator, I remind myself that being female doesn't make you automatically better at looking after little kids, nor more interested in it. Nurturing is not an exclusively female trait, and males entering a predominantly female industry is a good thing in the medium term because it tends to drive pay increases across the sector.

But I've just been processing the whole journey to where we are at now.  \n\n\nI remember every conversation ended up being her whining about something. But it wasn't the whining, it was two things, I worked out.  \n\n\na) There was always a looming expectation that if she had a problem, that was somehow my problem: it's my fault or I should fix it. If she feels a negative emotion I have to make that emotion go away, if she wants money I have to give her money, if she has a problem in the house I have to fix that problem, if she has a practical need, I have to be the one to fill that need.    \n\n\nb) It was never reciprocal. I wouldn't mind having to coddled her and comfort and pick up the pieces and babysit her life, if she was doing at least as much for me. I need help and she says \"I'm sorry, wish I could come help you!\" I want her to come to my shows at school \"Sorry, I need to be at home doing other things!\" I want her to pay some of my bills when I'm struggling or help clean something of mine \"Oh, sorry, I don't have money, I'm not available!\"  \n\n\nHow come I have to fend for myself and how come she thinks she can ask me to be her babysitter when the tables are turned? I did get to the point where I did dig myself out of my pit, by myself, and didn't need her for anything any more and stopped asking. Then not only was she whining to me to fix her issues, she was complaining that I wasn't asking her for anything and didn't \"need\" her. WTF????? Why, so you can just have the pleasure of saying no to me?  \n\n\nThree things I did: I stopped telling her anything about myself. I specifically stopped complaining about ANYTHING to her: As far as she was concerned my life was fine, I didn't have problems and I didn't need anything. She would complain a lot about me \"not telling her anything\" but what she meant was \"Not telling me anything juicy so I can lord it over you.\"  \n\n\nThe next thing I did was every time she told me about her drama and problems I would refuse to accept responsibility. If she said \"I feel like you don't love me anymore.\" I would say \"I'm sorry you feel that, that sounds hard.\" If she said \"I'm living hand to mouth I don't have enough for the bills next week\" (Lie btw, she is just terrible at managing money) I would say \"That sounds hard, I know you can figure something out.\" If she said \"Your grandmother is driving me crazy, I can't take it any more.\" I would say \"I'm sorry to hear that. I'll be sending good vibes your way.\" If she said \"My mower broke and I don't know how I'm going to pay for a new one.\" I would say \"That sounds so annoying, that's unfortunate for you.\"  \n\n\nI don't accept responsibility for her negativity.   \n\n\nThe last thing I did was explicitly say I was never going to do her any favours again, and I would not expect any from her again. \"I won't be giving you money, I'm not letting you stay in the house, I'm not coming over there to fix anything of yours, I don't have time to babysit any of your pets anymore. I have my own life and I need to get on top of it and look after myself. I also won't ask you to babysit for me or bail me out of anything.\" She really took offense at that, saying \"I would never ask you for anything....!\"   \n\n\nInsane, because that exact week she'd been asking me another \"loan\" of $100 for cigarettes.  \n\n\nIn the end she's NC'd herself. Now that she has to look after herself, and doesn't get the dopamine hits from whining to me about problems, and I also don't tell her any negative things about myself she says \"We have nothing to talk about... I'm bothering you, aren't I?\"  \n\n\nIf you've got nothing to say except whining and self pity and manipulation and you don't want to hear anything about the good things in my life because it would make you feel worthless... I guess we DON'T have anything to say. She tried a few times to even bring up old gripes about be from the past -  \n\n\nShe started talking about what a terrible handful I was when I was a little kid, how I was always talking to her too much. How all the kids hated me and how my teachers hated me too. I finally snapped and said \"Why are we talking about any of this??? It was thirty years ago, and I clearly am not the same person now. I've already moved on from that stuff, why are you picking at old wounds again? Are you just trying to hurt me for fun now?\" She whined and said \"We have nothing to talk about...\"   \n\n\nYeah, if the only you want to talk about is negativity and having a pity party or gloating about how much better you are than others - I guess we really do have nothing to talk about."

I noticed that there was something about her that she was always all up in her own perspective and her own feelings about things. That she would profess all day and all night how much she loved me, but the reality of her behaviour was that every time she felt picked on or unhappy for any reason, that she gave herself permission to attack and lash out and bully and degrade until she felt better herself.  \n\n\nAnd it didn't matter how anyone else felt about it: it didn't matter that it was going to fuck me up mentally for decades, it didn't matter that I was s toddler and the reaction was way inappropriate, it didn't matter that it wasn't my job to make her happy and cater to her as a toddler. All that mattered was that she only cared about her own feelings and perspective and if the rest of the world didn't bow down to how important and amazing she was, she was going to attack and attack until she felt better. As a form of self soothing.  \n\n\nThat's why when she sent me to my room to punish me, she would deliberately talk down to me a lecture me and hit me until I was terrified and crying, because until she could make me visibly as upset as she felt, she didn't feel happy again. She hadn't gotten her revenge for me \"doing something to her\" to make her feel negative.  \n\n\nShe's living in this delusionally incongruent state where she believes she loves me and everything is great and she worships the ground I walk on... as long as she feels happy.  It feels like gaslighting, but it's not intentional, so much as she's delusional. As soon as she attacks and gets her satisfaction out of making me feel as worthless as possible, she goes unconscious again: I'm happy now, therefore you should be too.  \n\n\nI can't speak for other people's BPDs, but mine is \"I love you, I don't care if you're happy or not, and I'm not going to help you or lift a finger to look after you beyond the stuff I can't get out of. I'm not going to listen to your life, I don't give a shit about it, I'm not going to turn up for you or be there, I'm not going to help you or support you, I'm going to do whatever the hell I want to give me my own emotional happy vibes, and it's your job not to make me feel unhappy either. It's just going to be conversations about me and how I feel and you're here to just listen and validate me. You're just a NPC to me and I don't care who you are or what you do.\"  \n\n\nExcept occasionally when she wakes up, looks around and sees there's almost no one who talks to her any more, close to the holidays she realises she doesn't know a thing about me or my life, and I don't give the remotest damn to try and force her to listen.   \n\n\nJust my life."

My mother, the one hidden in my previous posts, has sold her house, driven 500 miles north to the tropics and has her money, and is now in the process of buying a new house in a retirement village.\n\nI'm going to therapy. \n\nMy mother had said she wanted to call me every week after she left town, and when that fell through and she didn't contact me for three months when it came her turn to call me, she discovered it's much easier to ~~pester~~ reach me through email.\n\nBut I've been keeping it pretty neutral and unemotional in the emails. My mother is the quiet uBPD type, she's a hermit and a waif, but the only time she'll go into queen rages is when I myself lash out in anger at her because she's finally pushed me too far by being passive aggressive and manipulative. I found if I just stay robotic and unemotional, there's absolutely nothing she can pin on me. \n\nHaving said that, I'm still struggling with wanting very much to cut her off completely, and yet her talking to me through email, semi dangling out baits of validation: but not actually. Since she spends those emails 90% of the time, talking about the things I  should feel sorry for her about. If she never asks me about myself, nor demonstrates in her behaviours that she cares when I offer the information, why offer in the first place?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a picture of myself taken when I was about 8 years old. I was smiling with a tight, puffy smile, refusing to show my teeth. At least a year prior to that, I had been jumping up and down and knocked two of my baby teeth out on a hard bench. Mum grabbed them and in her panic, jammed them back into my face. She didn't take me to the dentist until the adult teeth started to come through and the baby teeth wouldn't come out. I had my two front teeth extracted, and spent six months waiting for the new ones to come through. I was teased at lot at school about it. I wouldn't smile.  \n\n\nBut this picture reminds me that my mother and grand father also mocked me about my missing teeth, on Christmas day of all things, and then punished me by sending me to bed without dinner for screaming at them to stop. Never got an apology for that, just excuses that she was in the right. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't love this person. I can't like this person. She disgusts me. I want to be done with her, and even now that she's 500 miles away I still can't figure out how to be done with her, because I wish I had even one parent that loves me. And she'll say she does all day and night, and the evidence says that she doesn't. I'm in therapy. I hope one day I can hold these two ideas in my mind in peace: that she can say she loves me, and I can believe her actions instead, not her words."

I don't know who I am because you are an emotional void, and you hate yourself *because* you are an emotional void. The only healthy thing is for you to find yourself, outside of your relation to me, just as I am doing. Not try to suck the literal lifeforce out of me like an emotional vampire.\n\nBut because I know that's impossible for you, I'm deliberately maintaining emotional distance. I know exactly why that's a problem for you, and I no longer care. You're 63 years old and have been a child your entire life. You made me your caretaker from the age of 1. I won't tolerate it anymore, it's time you were forced to grow up and take care of your own emotional landscape. If you can't do that, buy another dog. Either way, don't expect me to jump when you blow the dog whistle anymore, of indeed, even look up from my phone long enough to cater to it.\n\nIt's not entirely your fault, after a lot of soul searching I realised I have an emotional saviour complex innate to my personality. So I guess I should be partially grateful to you that you, in your desperate neediness, took a child like that, and instead of strengthening them as you should, you made them your worshiper. That's why you've become a corrupt and evil being. But now don't be surprised that the see saw swings the other way. You say \"Everyone eventually leaves me\" Yes. That's true, everyone eventually dies or moves on and who you are left with, is yourself. If you hate the only person left, and you blame the outer world for that hatred, then you will further entrench your position.\n\nFrom now on, don't call me if you want something: attention, love, money, validation, whatever. I'm empty too, and have nothing to give. Fill yourself, then give from your abundance. Such is the key to happiness and contentment. That's what I need to learn, and now I'm breaking you, so you either learn it yourself or lie down. You REALLY wanted me to be your parent, well suck it down, this is what a REAL parent does. Not that you would know.\n\nPeace out.\""

                "body": "So my uBPD is leaving town tomorrow. She pressured me into making a commitment to her calling me at a certain time every week, citing when I was in Big City, I called her every day. Note: I called HER every day, out of my own money, because she wouldn't pay for it, because I was living below the poverty line, alone, depressed and stressed and needed a mother. Not because I wanted a best friend. \n\nBecause she wouldn't help me when I was struggling to survive, wouldn't visit me, didn't even go to either of my graduations and didn't give me any help at all when I was moving back to Current City.\n\nNow she's blown all her money, sold her house because she's determined to do her own thing, never listen to advice. She's still trying to manipulate me into being her saviour, or alternatively enmeshing me back into a co-dependent dynamic. There never really was a co-dependent dynamic, just me being held hostage because I was young and reliant on her.\n\nNow she's gone out of town 500 miles away. She thinks I'm offended she's selling my childhood home. I'm not, I'm a) offended she kicked me out of it five years earlier when I pointed out her dog was morbidly obese from neglect and b) I'm offended she did everything in her power to ignore my help and advice, and yet still insist on sponging off others so she can be a kept woman.\n\nFor all she claimed she was abused by my grandmother (not sure I believe it entirely, but Gma wasn't a very emotionally available woman in her youth, but NOT BPD) she still had no problem milking her and abusing her to the very end, and then refused to give a funeral to the woman who, honestly, did all the labor of raising me. I guess I was her sponging back up plan, now that's fallen though, what does she do?\n\nFinds not only two other friends/relations to sponge off, but also finds a co-dependent (and probably also BPD based on her same relating patterns) replacement daughter she picked up at a local fast food restaurant. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm only useful or not useful to her. \n\nI'm supposed to give her a forced audience at an exact time on an exact day of the week. \n\nI put her number direct to voicemail. \n\nI'm not sure what awaits me now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've got my therapy referral. I need to fax it in, getting mental health care, especially one targeted to abusive childhoods is a complicated process in this country. I get about 10 sessions subsidized by the government. But I need the referral to qualify. \n\nMainly what I feel is a sense of unease, the shadow of not knowing what the future will hold and just wanting to have the right to carve out my space at last and live an adult life without dancing to the tune of the permanently discontented puppet master. She gets her little harem of co-narcissists so easily, I had to unfriend more than a few sponging high school \"friends\" because they got sucked back into her orbit, and not least of which because they themselves have habits which send my warning bells clanging. Can you imagine a mid thirties year old woman coming up to me, reminding me we went to high school together and telling me what great friends she is with my mother? How they talk all the time! (Obviously not about me though, since she didn't know anything about what I was up to, but then neither does my mother).\n\nDoesn't that seem extremely odd? That you tell me that you, my age peer, are close friends with my mother? \n\nNow, why are any of all of them surprised when I act with complete boredom, as if you just told me about some new drywall you bought to replace your old drywall. It's a calculated move unfortunately, to exhaust you of purile attention seeking."

So, to give context to this question, I have social anxiety, which is linked to my childhood trauma & neglect. I have been working a lot on myself and I am a better person for it, but I am still behind on my happiness and social life. My trauma made me a people pleaser and it seems like I maybe am not yet out of the pleasing waters, cause there are still problems with how I communicate.\n\nSee, when I share my thoughts or my feelings with others, I feel like Im not really connected to what i say. Or, in another instance, someone tells me something casual and I cant seem to come to an answer (the exchange stops right there). Yet, I am not sure if I am afraid to be judged by others (so, poor self esteem) by disconnecting from my emotions so their possible judgment doesnt affect me, or if I just have poor social skills, because my parents didnt really have an interest to talk to me (I cannot hold a casual conversation). But maybe, those casuals conversations arent really interesting to me, so I cant find something to say.\n\nAnyway, I am going to ask thoses questions to my therapist later in the week, so I'll have a professional answer, but in the meantime, I was wondering what others thought about this issue.\n\nThank you and have a nice day \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f"

It\u2019s not like a normal burp as I still get those and they don\u2019t feel weird. Normal burps you feel coming and they feel like they\u2019ve come from your stomach and they also smell like the food or drink you had. \nThe other type of burp through is just different. It feels like it comes from the chest and it has no smell. They also get trapped in my throat until they get big enough and I can burp them out. It doesn\u2019t come out with the force of a normal burp either; instead it comes out like as if I exhaled it.\n\nJust hear me out for a second. I ain\u2019t no doctor but I think I know my body just enough to comment on it. I believe this second type of burp is actually air being expelled from my pneumothorax. I still currently have a pneumothorax but it\u2019s less than 2cm and I\u2019m doing walks to reduce like the doc said. Well I\u2019m getting these burps and hopefully when I see him on Tuesday the air will be almost gone. I\u2019m probs wrong cos there would probs still need to be a hole in my lung for air to be expelled and I think that hole has healed up almost completely.\n\n\nBreathing through plastic bag feeling:\n\nThis isn\u2019t a problem but just wondering if anyone feels the same. Basically got a massive pneumothorax last week. I had it for about a month but it was only uncomfortable and thought it would resolve on its own. I was wrong. Got real bad last week and got that feeling I\u2019m talking about. \nMy affected lung legit felt like it was a plastic bag with a hole in it. I got it aspirated and finally could breathe but still felt like breathing through a broken plastic bag especially on deep breaths. After a day it felt like the hole in the \u201cplastic bag\u201d got much smaller. On the second day it felt like I was breathing with an almost healed lung again. I worsen it when I laugh too.\n\nWell just wondering if anyone gets that feeling too"

Ein neues kaufen ist mir \u00f6kologisch und menschlich zuwider (s. Abbau von seltenen Erden, Platin, Cobalt,...) nach so kurzer Zeit.

Manche haben keine Zeit auf den Umtausch zu warten, andere keine Lust oder sind zu gutm\u00fctig. Andere schicken es dann zur\u00fcck und kriegen wof\u00fcr sie bezahlt haben. Wenn das in etwa der H\u00e4lfte der F\u00e4lle funktioniert, dass man eine schlechtere Qualit\u00e4t f\u00fcr sagen wir, 70\u20ac mehr verkauft dann ist das ein ziemlich netter Zusatzgewinn. Warum sollte man es anders machen, vorsllem hinsichtlich der Lobpreisungen vieler Kunden dass der Umtausch so problemlos ging wenn's erste mies war? \n\nDa f\u00fchl ich mich als Konsumentin doch irgendwie verarscht & irgendwie bewogen das Mal hier anzusprechen um zu sehen was ihr davon denkt.\nWie sind eure Erfahrungen mit refurbished Ger\u00e4ten?

My mom of course gaslit me that everyone with a period also has pain. I took matters into my own hands at 17 and went to a doc who found by ultrasound and laparoscopy that I have both endometriosis and, probably related to it, 21 ovarian cysts in total. \n\nHe recommended me the pill and I did go on the pill. It helped a lot, since I was instructed to only go on the \"period\" pause twice a year. He also monitored the cysts and they vanished over time, with a few of them popping and causing me intense pain in between. Last year, in my last check up I had only one cyst left. I decided to go off the pill, because I had issues with it, including water retention, moodiness, lack of motivation and stamina. So I expected the pain to come back but it actually did not. After getting off I bled for a solid month, with lots of pain but since then I've had the averagest of average periods time wise, 3-4 days of bleeding plus a little more residual blood for 1-2 days each 35-42 days. Pain is still kind of strong at 2-3 days from the day before starting the period, like I'd need at least 800mg of ibu to be pain free but I can stand it without using painkillers which is so much less than usual. I feel that could be considered fairly normal, right? It's also getting less each time. It's also more a pulling pain than the usual \"stab me in the abdomen and pour some acid in the wound\" kind of pain that makes you go mad. \n\nI wonder, is my endo maybe going away?

They are about 10cm long, while the rest of my hair is almost shoulder length. \n\nHairspray on a Spoolie doesn't do it, and most products seem too heavy on my easily-greasy superfine but plenty hair. Hair structure is kind of wavy. \n\nIs there a way to handle this? Or do I need a short cut? If so, anyone has a good short cut for a 25 year old, white brunette with a heart shaped, rather oblong face and fine hair?"

In total she laid I think 8-10 eggs and it definitely seemed very exhausting to her! She somehow lost most of her belly feathers in the process and her poor belly is basically naked :( \n\nNow she had a few sneezing attacks where she loudly sneezed several times in a row and has been making short, high pitched beeps once in a while while usually, she is a very silent bird. You rarely hear her at all. \n\nFurthermore she has been making movements just like the \"pressing\" she did while laying an egg and puffes up once in a while, could be laboured breathing. The other bird seems perfectly healthy (despite being an absolute moron). \n\nAside from that she's active, eats normal amounts, also eats from the hand and seems to behave just like always... \n\nThey live inside and only are in the cage when we are out or when they sleep. Otherwise they have plenty of space to fly (~60qm + some forbidden areas where they still occasionally break into) \n\nDoes she have a cold? Should I offer her a heated box or something like that?"

The shelter is in a not so safe, not so pretty city and currently, it's very cold - just for context.\n\nSo I arrived there with quite some stress already, feeling underqualified as I have no job experience working with animals. But I was also excited because I love animals, especially cats. At the same time, a whole car full of hairless cats arrived. They smelled very bad and sweaty. \n\nMy job was to wash the cats and I had to keep a window open because I was retching from the smell. \nUnfortunately, they were very slippery due to being soapy. Imagine a raw chicken in lube. Or those slippery toys, the tube-like gel filled things you could barely hold that were very cool around 2000. \n\nAnd like, half of these 20-30, I don't even know, cats fled. I could not hold them, they just kind of shlurped through my slippery hands. They fucking yeeted themselves out of the window in their glistening slipperiness and I, the tough acting engineer, started uncontrollably crying because I was sure they would either freeze to death or get grilled being mistaken for raw chicken. \n\nSo I kept washing and losing cats and crying and it was definitely one of my worst nightmares ever lmao."

I stayed here for a while thinking I could be helpful to others, but a lot of the time it feels like any advice I give or thoughts I have \"fall on deaf ears\". Understandably. RJ isn't something you just \"get over\", it's pervasive in our lives and even crippling in severe cases.\n\nThe worst thing, I think, is the fact that \"normal\" people don't seem to understand just how hard it is to live with RJ. A lot of the time they think you're just petty or controlling or whatever. They look down on you for something you literally can't control. I've had to learn this the hard way, so please listen: DO NOT waste your time with someone who never tries to truly understand things from your perspective. Sometimes a person will \"try\" to understand you because they like you so much, but there will always be moments where they don't like you as much. Those are the times you're gonna wish you fell in love with an empathetic person, instead of someone who makes you feel like trash for your flaws.\n\nI'm saying all of this because I've seen so many people on here feeling guilty for their RJ. People like us need empathy in our lives. NOT codependency. NOT tolerance. NOT judgement. Empathy. \n\nThanks for all the support. Good luck to anyone who reads this \ud83d\udc96"

I'm one person who only eats once a day (really slow metabolism). I'll usually buy like super cheap food like a bag of tater tots is $2.44 here and that'll last 2 days. Or a box of KD for $2. I only drink 0 calorie drinks (usually water) which I get big cases from Costco. I'm not a fan of bread and I'm allergic to mushrooms. I don't really like dairy and usually buy meat from butchers because they're cheaper (I eat all types of meat). I was hoping to get some lower calorie extremely cheap meal ideas for college students. I spent a lot of time grading/teaching so meals that don't take too much time to make are ideal. I've recently been living off ramen since I can get a 5/pk for $4-5. I don't eat very well since I'm mainly concerned with the cost of things.\n\nAny tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance."

                "created_utc": 1643883876.0,
                "body": "I dont think this post will get a lot of answers or reads but I'm just writing it for myself. I like Kubrik films but I'm not a Kubrik fan. I still haven't been able to finish watching \"Clockwork Orange\" because the rape scene is particularly harrowing to me personally, but I do love \"The Shining\" and love to analyze the themes and symbolism Kubrik added to the film. So I decided to give \"Eyes Wide Shut\" a try and good god, I love it. The movie resonates with me on so many levels it has become my favorite Kubrik film even above the Shining, which I didn't think was possible.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know there are a lot of conspiracy theories that have surged from this film, just like there are a lot of conspiracy theories stemming from The Shinning, but I don't think Kubrik was trying to warn us about Illuminati sexual rituals and stuff like that. Just like with \"The Shinning\" uncovering the violent and white supremacist history of the US, I think the secret Kubrik was letting us in in \"Eyes Wide Shut\" is a lot more insidious because it's hiding in plain sight. We all know that the elites are guilty of sexual exploitation, we know how women's bodies are exploited by the people in power. We know about sexual objectification and sexual abuse of children. But we prefer to keep our eyes shut to those horrible facts because admitting that wE lIvE In a SoCiEtY where our daughters are always in danger of becoming preys to sexual exploiters is too horrible.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI find it very interesting that, just like with \"The Shining\", many of the conspiracy theories create the \"Illuminati/satanic\" bogeyman, which I think is just a scapegoat to avoid realizing that the enemy is actually far less secret, that it might be their boss, or their president, or the rich guy/actor they idolize. Hell, the Weinstein scandal happened just a few years ago, not to mention #MeToo. I also find it incredible how many people ignore the obvious parallels between Ziegler and Mandy (or all the girls of the cult, if we go from the interpretation that Ziegler is the red cloak) and the Epstein sex-ring of underage girls. Kubrik codes that relationship as being one of child sexual exploitation. Ziegler refers to Mandy as \"kiddo\" and looms over her like a disapproving father. He eventually characterizes her as a hooker even though she probably wasn't (the newspaper refers to her as a former ex beauty queen, she was probably a struggling model being sold into sexual slavery to maintain her career) and how he'd rather blame her drug abuse than himself and his sexual exploitation of her. I doubt Kubrik intended it, but the parallel between Epstein and Ziegler is just baffling to me, which is probably why this is one of my favourite films ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne more thing before I leave: Kubrik definitely plays with symbolism in his films. Occult rituals are also something that can be attributed to the symbolism of \"Pan\" or the Devil, the god of basically all hedonistic urges. I definitely believe there's a bit of a conservative streak in how Kubrik represents hedonism in this film because he more or less ends up sending the message that hedonism (especially sexual) will innevitably lead to death or exploitation or corruption, and so staying in a marriage is the best alternative, which.... meh. Dunno how to feel about that one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI would've liked to see more from the perspective of Alice. She's my favorite character. Her sexual nature seems to be completely confined by her role as a wife, mother and housewife. I think the film associates her with the ocean (naval officer, the color blue), and art (she used to work at an art gallery), because those elements represent intuition and creativity and cannot be contained or controlled in any way. Even when Bill attempts to maintain his wife in her role within his house, she's far too beautiful, passionate, complex and intuitive to be constrained in that role, which is probably why she has the urge to laugh at him so much. It's sort of like a mockery of \"oh you think you can put me in a box and keep me there\". At the same time, she is choosing to stay in that box, whether it be because of financial security and stability or because she genuinely loves her husband, I dont know.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat's a summary of my thoughts, I could go on and on, but I think this post will become too long if I do."

Today was the first time we met again and she came up to me and gave me her number. That's great, right?\n\nWell, today was another first: the first time I had a driving lesson with a particular teacher again. There was an interrim period where I had another teacher but now it's back to this one. I had previously always felt like crying after his lessons but this time I went full panic attack.\n\nIdk if you know what I mean, but I was barely keeping it together as I had previously done to find a safe place to break down. This was my first panic attack in over a year.\n\nAnyway, I was in this state, not quite keeping the tears back, and this is when I had the encounter with her. She hugged me twice, gave me her number, and I went inside to surrender to the emotions.\n\nKinda weird though: I have never laughed during a panic attack. This was definitely one of the weirdest cocktails of emotion I have ever experienced. \n\nI'm mostly writing this to vent and process but maybe some of y'all will appreciate the follow-up.\n\nFuck me. Life is absolutely absurd and bizarre. What are the odds of this happening? I have no more words...\n\nAnyway, wish me luck, I will message her tomorrow..."

The question is how to model it.\n\nI have created a widget using the Automate app that logs my recent consumptions (measured in bowls) and from there calculates a high-ness score. I estimated a function of highness over time: f: [0h; 7h] \u2192 [0; 1], following roughly the values I measured for myself of when I reach the stages ([see here](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Weed)), where peak is 1 and rise and fall is linear (I figured the approximation is sufficient and I would rather over-estimate), begin of after effects is level 0.15. For overlapping bowls, the functions are added (i.e. the values at the current time is added).\n\nNow I question the sensibility of this model. Shouldn't I increase a singular value and have it drop with an exponential function if we only care about THC level which afaik drops off exponentially? Or are there other factors that play a role in the quality of the high, e.g. a chain of decomp products that create a different high or something like that?\n\nI could read a lot about the whole process but I figured there are plenty of smart people here, maybe someone can give me a TL;DR or some input about how to model this?

I had never done this before but (get this:) read the wikihow article and it actually helped in addition to just doing what she did.\n\nMy brain basically shut down completely at that point and we were uhm \"dancing\" rather publically.

We found other ways to have fun :) Any of you guys been in that situation?

If this is the case then I can still have the ability to immerse myself into detailed daydreams but I just won\u2019t be dependant on it(like a coping mechanism, which is what it basically is now)\n\nI hope I made my point across, if I didn\u2019t please do ask so I can make myself clearer, sorryyy in advance!

There was like a different race of humanity and they have eyes that are brighter than normal humans and are prettier(?) than normal humans. I don't remember if the boy was one of the superhumans but the girl was. The girl was blonde and blue eyes. And also they had super healing and healed faster. The government was using them to kill(?) People like policemen I think. And the girl then escapes from the facility after one of her superhuman friends does in there I think? And the superhumans don't seem to be as emotional as normal people. And I think they are like dead people who come back to life or something similar  (but they might die when shit in the head I'm sorry I don't remember much)\n\nOne scene I remember is when all the girls were lined up in the government fascility and everyone is beautiful except her because she has such ugly scars on her breast and they were doing an inspection and she wanted to keep her tank top on but the gaurd got angry and forced her to take it off revealing the scars\n\n\nAnother scene I distinctly remember is when the boy and girl are alone in a room and I think they are making out and the boy takes off his shirt and the girl keeps her tank top on because she is embarrassed about her breasts because she has scars and was embarrassed. But he thought she was beautiful and wasn't disgusted.\n\n\nThese two moments aren't exactly important I'm the grand scheme of the plot but I don't remember much else if you can find the book I will be so grateful."

This is when she learns that there are other people like her who get murdered by scientists and wake up the next day like everything is fine. Then she teams up with these kids and they figure out that the astroid is going to kill humanity and they were going to be the only survivors, the scientists saved her and some others by putting a computer into the center of the earth and downloading the kids into it so they can be online. Near the end of the book they are on this online kind of world where the kids have to fend for themselves because only the fittest person can survive and the scientists have had a couple challenges for them.\n\nI remember that this book is made in English and that it is the first part of a series."

Dray must have very fragile masculinity issues if he claims getting punched in the face by another man is embarrassing. It kinda checks out with stuff he\u2019s said in the past about men who cry or show emotions.\n\nSecondly, he made the comment that \u201cI\u2019m not going to go into detail about why I punched him. If I do, y\u2019all will think I\u2019m trying to make him look bad.\u201d All that tells me is that Dray still has some justifications in his own mind for him to do what he did. He made some vague comment like \u201churt people hurt people\u201d or \u201cI need to work through some things\u201d, but if your internal reasoning still deflects blame, you\u2019re not doing any work.\n\nAnd lastly, he seemed way too focused on the fact that the video got leaked while a bunch of other people get away with stuff like that in closed door practices, and not focused enough on the fact that his punch was the real issue. \n\nIt\u2019s getting really hard for me as a fan to keep rooting for this guy."

                "body": "Hello Reddit, this is absolutely pointless but I wish to put it out of my chest. I don't think anyone will read this, but if you do, have fun with my disgrace.\n\nA few months back I (27F) started at a new job in the editorial field. I wanted to be in the translating department, but I was accepted as an text revisor. Okay, modesty aside, I can do great in both English and my mother language, so I didn't complain. \n\nAs I started, only me and a few more colleagues were attending the office in person, most of other employees were working from home. So I had these calm, easy few weeks of boring routine, knowing the other people by mentions or their belongings on their desks. I liked this particular desk with a Pikachu on it, it improved my day.\n\nSome time later, people started to come back to the office (despite Covid being like, as bad as ever, but my employers couldn't care less). \n\nOne day I just arrived all silly and dumb as ever and, as I walked in, I almost collide with this tall, brunette, long-haired, sharp-eyed dude with glasses and an intense glare, wearing a shirt of a franchise I love and also own a couple of shirts of. He's certainly around my age. He says \"sorry\" in his very quiet and deep voice and goes his way. He is exactly my type, even though I've never talked to him. My heart is pounding. I wanna know him better.\n\nLook, I don't have a happy relationship historic. I was decided to not like anyone anymore after troubled relationships that didn't pay off. And I did avoid! I successfully avoided liking other people and was happy on my own for a couple of years. And then this dude appeared.\n\nHe's in a senior in the translating department, so I don't really have a reason to talk to him. He's not a talkative person, too. He sits across the office from me, at the other side. At the Pikachu table. At this point I'm already in disbelief. \n\nSince then, I try not to pay attention to him, but everytime he walks across the room my heart goes bananas. Because of conversations with colleagues here and there, I got to know a bit about him, and the more I know the more I want to know him personally, to talk to him, because I am so sure we'd have so much fun together. He likes a lot of the same things as I do, and he is so, so beautiful.\n\nThe thing is, adding to the fact that he is not really an open, \"friendly\" person, he is in a relationship since forever, apparently. And very serious about it. No sign of it going wrong.\n\nI don't know what to do. It's been weeks now, my friends and work colleagues and even my family can't stand me pining over him anymore. I downloaded these dating apps and pressed X on, like, 700 different profiles. I am looking for the one person that is not in the goddamn app.\n\nI feel like Bella Swan from Twilight, but older, dumber and Edward Cullen doesn't pay attention to her. \nI hate my life.\n\nThat's it."

I don't know if anyone's gonna read this but well, I tried! Let me explain briefly what is happening:\n\nI've been on fluoxetine for years now, treating depression and anxiety/mood swings. It gives me constant tremor but I've gotten used to it. I've taken other medications but in the end this was the best for me. I'm alright, anxiety pretty under control, but I have zero will to live, zero energy do to stuff, I just want to lie down and wait for my demise.\n\nOkay, given that, I went to my psychiatrist and asked him about the energy problem and after a long conversation he suggested Bupropion, to take together with Fluoxetin. Good, great, I agreed. He mentioned that at the beginning I could feel a bit of anxiety worsening, and I decided to try.\n\nWell, here I am on my second day of Bupropion (minimum quantity) and the anxiety is literally KILLING ME. I cannot function at work, my heart rate is elevated the whole day, the tremors worsened a lot... It's pure chaos. I don't know what to do. I'm gonna try and contact the doctor tomorrow, but here it's 10pm now and I'm spiraling.\n\nI literally went up and down my residential building stairs (?) a million times just now to see if it helped. I'm better but still pretty anxious.\n\nSo please please please, has anyone gone through this? What do you usually do? Was the anxiety gone after some days? \n\nThanks in advance!"

I remember it had something to do with a letter from a father or for a father. Or a son, maybe. I don't remember if there was any instruments at some point or at all... If it had, it would give a very acoustic and sad vibe. I remember the sound of wind, maybe? It may break to some heavy thing after, but I honestly can't say/don't remember.\n\nAbout the genre/style, I remember downloading a lot of albums to give a try and was trying with bands like Wintersun and SuidAkra, was a big fan of thrash/viking stuff. I have no idea why but I have this clear image of an album cover that was mostly ice-blue with an equally ice-blue maple leaf (or some similar leag?) in the middle. I think the song was from this album, but I cannot remeber the artist by any means.\n\nThanks a lot in advance for those who try and help me!\n\nEdit: it's definitely from the heavy metal scene, like Thrash Metal, Viking Metal and correlates!"

He whines whenever he\u2019s alone, but even when we\u2019re with him he looks really sad and can\u2019t even sleep. \n\nWhenever he tries to sleep, he breathes really fast and acts very helpless (won\u2019t try to get off the couch by himself, won\u2019t go up the stairs, won\u2019t go outside if given the chance) and stays in a corner or tight spaces, once he\u2019s outside he does like to chase me but I suspect it\u2019s because everything outside is new and I\u2019m the only thing he\u2019s mildly familiar with, he also licks my hands and feet a lot \n\nHe likes the pets and praise but won\u2019t accept treats.

I\u2019ve gotten a lot better at managing it than when I started and I\u2019m not high all day like I used to.\n\nNow I only use it as a pre-workout before I got to the gym and it helps A LOT, now I\u2019m able to push myself to limits I had never gotten to before using cannabis since my pain is decreased and I can focus on other things in my head ignoring my fatigue and pain, I thought I could use an actual pre workout to replace this but caffeine also doesn\u2019t play nice with stimulants.\n\nCould it be that the stimulants alone are good enough and I don\u2019t need any of this? Before I would get bored and focus on my pain which wasn\u2019t good for motivation. I want to keep losing weight too because it\u2019s helping me a lot. \n\nI also eat an edible every once in a while but I figured I can still get high once or twice a month on my days off the med like my psychiatrist said I could do with alcohol \n\nAlso should I tell my psychiatrist that I consume cannabis? It\u2019s legal where I live\n\nThanks"

I wasn't told this on the face, they just sent me an email introducing me to the recruiting firm and to arrange a meeting. Since our company offers managed services (OnSite) I thought it was for a position like this. So I agreed and met with them.\n\nFor some context, for the last 11 months, I have been working at this consultancy in the Midwest, USA. I was hired because their CTO thought they were going to get more  Angular/React projects from their clients. But in the last year, I have yet to work on any modern frontend libraries or frameworks besides Bootstrap with this company. \n\nDuring all this time, I only worked on exactly 3 small projects. One of them lasted 4 days in total. According to my supervisor, this is because we haven't had many projects for development and most of the projects we get are for the consultancy side of the business. The rest of my time here I've been idle. Meaning I still get paid to train and get certifications while we wait to get projects in the door.\n\nMy supervisor and CTO  both told me I had nothing to worry about and that my job was secure because \"we strongly believe we're moving in the direction of getting new clients that request projects with your skillset\". So I took advantage of this and trained as much as I could bear before getting insanely bored.\n\nI didn't look to move because I thought I could take advantage of this to take it easy for now while I buy a house which I recently did. But now I am a little worried I'm going to go time without a salary right after buying a house.\n\nShould I worry that I will be laid off at any moment now? \n\nShould I go straight to my supervisor or CTO about this?\n\n Or is this an HR decision? They also didn't reach out about this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously, I'm applying to jobs and getting my name back out there since I was told about this now but I was certainly not ready for this.\n\nEdit 1: added location"

Of course you are giving your opponent a foot in the door to beat you, and this is a totally stupid way to play pickleball, but if DUPR wants people to value and trust the ratings it gives, then presumably they care.  DUPR wants you to care enough to win all the points you can (because there is a difference between beating someone 11-9 vs. 11-1), but don\u2019t beat them 11-0 because that is too good for the algorithm.\n\nThis is truly stupid both for the game of Pickleball and for DUPR.",

I couldn't even buy Endgame tickets with cash -- you had to have a cell phone with a chinese phone number (it is like they use phone numbers like we use email here in USA for identity and account recovery).\n\nChina doesn't support eSIM, so it makes sense to move my regular USA T-mobile line to my eSIM, and free up the slot for a Chinese SIM card, should the need arise.  (Note:  You still need to unlock the phone in order to do add a line with the physical SIM!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Potential Downside(s)**\n\n* **Not officially supported for postpaid.**  T-mobile representatives in store and on phone claimed that there are problems supporting it.  (Fast forward:  I have eSIM enabled and it is fine, but disclaimer -- you do this at your own risk)\n* **No Physical SIM.**  eSIM is basically a software SIM card, so it is tied to your phone.

So if you drop your phone in the lake, you can't take out the SIM and put into another phone, you would need to go through some hoops to enable eSIM on a different phone or ask T-Mobile to move you to a physical SIM in the new phone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Background**\n\nT-mobile officially only supports eSIM for prepaid accounts and has support for it in a special app.  Postpaid accounts are the \"regular\" accounts where you pay a monthly subscription fee, such as for T-Mobile ONE or ONEPlus.\n\nI have had problems trying to enable eSIM by phone and in-store.  They said that they only support eSIM on prepaid accounts, and there are problems with enabling it.  Interestingly, when I went to the store, the people in front of me asked the exact same question, and given the speed of the response, it was clear that they get this question a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Attempt**\n\nI used the chat support on the T-mobile app and told them directly what I wanted.  I wanted to move my T-Mobile account from a physical SIM to my \"digital SIM\" (also known as eSIM, but when you go to Settings > General > About  on your iPhone, it says digital SIM).  I wanted to be clear but avoid saying \"eSIM\" in case that was a keyword that results in a no.\n\nThere was no pushback.  I gave them my digital SIM number, but they didn't want that.  I then gave them my EID number and she put it through.  There was a text to confirm your identity, and once you do that, you reboot the phone and you are done!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Summary**\n\n1. Go to your T-mobile app\n2. Go to chat support on T-mobile app\n3. Tell them that you want to change your SIM on your account from physical SIM to digital SIM (eSIM).  You may want to try saying digital SIM instead of eSIM, and you may or may not want to give them the reason (my China example above).  They were generally super supportive.\n4. Give them your 19-digit EID (Settings > General > About > EID)\n5. Confirm that you want it activated as your main T-mobile sim number\n6. They will send you a confirmation number via SMS that you give to them to confirm your identity.\n7. Reboot your device\n8. Go to Settings > Cellular to make sure you activate your plan on digital SIM and remove the link to your physical SIM.\n9. Done!  Now you can remove your physical SIM, reboot and retry everything before you throw it away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/VJx6CED](https://imgur.com/a/VJx6CED)"

On the other, I don't really need foie gras to survive, it is clearly an indulgent type of food.  So would the stoic eat it if available, not eat it if not available, and doesn't really care one way or the other about the geese?  Would a stoic have any misgivings about being a foie gras farmer?  I would imagine no, the only question I have is about the indulgence of the stoic eater and the lack of temperance for the suffering posed by the stoic farmer.  \n\n**Abortion**:  Probably the most controversial of the topics, but from a stoic standpoint, I would imagine that this is the easiest.  If one needs to abort a pregnancy, do so.  \n\n**Affirmative action**:  I would imagine that one the one hand, the stoic believes that men/women should just people on ability if the purpose of the judgement (getting a job, being accepted to university, etc.) is to identify the best person for the job.  Ultimately, they would want the process to be fair and transparent.  However, if there is bias in the process (e.g., clear discrimination against one class of people), that should be eliminated from the process practically.  But I don't think they would mandate a certain allocation of minority or underprivileged groups of people.\n\nHave I thought about the these topics as a stoic would?"

My friend just gave me two separate words in a dictionary and mixed up one of the lines. But 10 years of using that name for everything online, I just resolved to keep it.

When the transfer valve closes, it isn't opening back up, and the compressor pumps itself down until it trips an internal safety switch, but it takes about an hour for the pressure to build enough to close the valve all the way, and up until the valve shuts all pressure and temperature measurements read normal.\n\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\n**TL;DR:** Everything behaves normally for about an hour (current draw,line pressures,line temps all normal. capacitor, contactor, thermostat, and reversing valve solenoid all tested normal) then the compressor overheats & shuts down while everything else remains operating (heat pump fan and inside air handler continue to blow, logic board continues showing normal operation through its diagnostic LEDs, voltage is still supplied to everything else properly). After the compressor shuts down the normally cold suction line at the compressor gets too hot to touch while the line feeding it on the other side of the reversing valve remains cool. I wanted to blame the reversing valve being stuck in the middle of its travel and not fully sliding over, but that's starting to make less sense seeing as the suction line only seems to get hot after the compressor shuts down. Any ideas?\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\n**Details:**\n\nLocation: South Louisiana (hot, humid)\n\nUnit: Residential HVAC, specifically the compressor (Copeland ZR34K3) in the outside heat pump (2002 Lennox HP26-036).\n\nProblem: After an hour of cooling, the compressor (and only the compressor) shuts off, the suction line at the compressor gets too hot to touch.\n\nWhen the unit starts up, there are no problems. The suction and discharge lines on both sides of the reversing valve behave properly. The suction line on both sides of the reversing valve is cold, the discharge line and copper muffler at the compressor and through to the outside coils gets quite hot. Everything stays normal like this typically for as long as an hour, sometimes more, sometimes less.\n\nEventually the compressor shuts off, I am assuming it's overheating and throwing a safety switch monitoring it's internal temp. The pump's fan is still running, the logic board shows normal operation, the air handler inside is still running, but the suction line at the compressor gets too hot to touch for long, the suction line on the other side of the reversing valve is instead still cool, and while sometimes the discharge line & muffler at the compressor is barely warm (pretty close to the outside air temp) other times it can remain just as hot as the suction line is now. Most of the time if the system is left on and the fans are left blowing room temp air, the compressor will eventually (2 hours?) cool off and start pumping again for another 15 to 30 minutes before getting hot and shutting off until it cools down again.\n\nI called an HVAC guy who didn't get to experience the problem. After an hour he got tired of waiting and left, the problem occurred about 30 minutes later and because it was already the end of the day for him he wasn't willing to come back. However, for that hour he did monitor the system and everything remained normal. I noted the pressure values, ~209 psig for the liquid line and 77 psig for the vapor line (installation manual shows that's normal range for the 90\u00b0F outside temp), I didn't see the temperature values but the HVAC tech said they were normal too (and I felt the lines, suction was cold, discharge was hot, nothing abnormal). He also measured the amp draw between the capacitor & fan + the compressor & logic board and everything was 100% well within normal tolerance. Of course, 30 minutes after he left the compressor shut down like we were waiting for.\n\nExtra info: the capacitor is new and was tested, before posting this I tested the solenoid on the reversing valve (receiving 24volts both before and after the compressor shuts down, and confirmed has a very strong magnetic pull when supplied voltage), the HVAC guy reviewed the thermostat's wiring inside and outside and reported no problems, he looked at the air handler and reported no problems, and lastly: while the problem is occurring.. if power to the compressor is cut, there is about a 5 second hissing sound coming from the direction of the heat pump (i.e. I hear it when I flip the breaker to the heat pump off through the panel inside the house, which is 4ft away through one wall from the heat pump).\n\nI wanted to blame the reversing valve being stuck in the middle of its travel and not fully sliding over, but that's starting to make less sense seeing as the suction line only seems to get hot after the compressor shuts down. What am I missing?"

It was clearly deliberate abandonment since whoever dropped him off broke the cheap lock keeping the fence closed to lead him in. I have about a half acre separated by chain link fence into a front, back, and side yard.\n\nDue to pending rains I built the little shack in those photos out of the cheapest particle board I could find (yes, the heat-reflecting coating was the cheapest in the store), and when he tried eating the particle board I wrapped it in tarp and he's left it alone since. No one I know keeps live stock, and until someone answers the local advertisements I am resigned to taking care of him as best as I can.\n\nGoogle has barely helped in terms of specific needs; I've bought goat feed to supplement what grass he eats from the ground and leaves from the crapemyrtle trees in that side yard, and I am changing his little water pail three times a day just to keep it clean. I still have specific questions and my local vet basically has given me all shoulders besides scheduling for vaccines and preventatives.\n\nI have noticed this sub doesn't answer questions super readily so I won't hold my breath, but if you recognize this kind of goat, consider yourself well-versed in goat care, and are willing to give me a few minutes of your time please get my attention. Thank you."

The designated individual would have some time to think for a bit and would then be asked to make one single and final proposal. All without deliberating or discussing how it should be spilt with his/her fellow participant. \n\nthe second individual would then either accept or decline the offer. \n\nHere\u2019s the catch, they were both instructed prior that if the the second individual declines the offer, BOTH PARTICIPANTS WALK AWAY WITH NOTHING.\n\nNow, from an economic perspective - person A should ask for $99 and person B should take the $1 because, well, $1 is better than nothing and it\u2019s completely out of their control anyway so, yay, free money. Right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThey found that individuals would decline the offer if it were on average lower than $30 (this seems to be a standard number across other experiments as well, the second individual needs at least a 30% cut to accept)\n\nWhat this experiment highlighted is that people are willing to incur VERY significant losses just to spite a deal that they feel is unfair. \n\nHumans psychologically and economically forfeit their own welfare for the sake of justice,, and they do so to a shockingly extreme extent..."

My takes are always unpopular (not in the \"based hot take\" way, more in the getting swarmed way). My posts keep averaging lower and lower whether it's a meme, a political opinion, or a random thought.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI had a weird realization today. The average active twitter or reddit user is like 14-18 years old. I'm 24. Of course I don't share the same thoughts and ideas about things as a bunch of teenagers. I used to, but like most people, my worldview has changed and matured over time. For example, I remember my 15-year-old self wanting to abolish prisons and decriminalize everything. Obviously, that's not a realistic thing that would go well, but back then I was hell-bent on convincing everyone around me that no one deserved to be in prison. It reminds me of kids now who think abolishing police is a practical idea.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's not just politics either, it's everything. I get annoyed by the dismissive \"unbothered\" culture that I see especially on twitter. I get downvoted on reddit for my thoughts about games, shows, and music.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow here's the rant part. Where tf did my age group go? I genuinely feel like every place on the internet is geared strongly toward either teens or boomers. And I've been spending the most time on facebook lately because I'd rather see shitty boomer memes than \"sksksk and that's on PERIANA [nails emoji] this you??? and i oop- maybe if you stanned (insert pop artist here).\" And I'm tired of hearing \"lol educate yourself you edgy shitlord, ignorance is a choice\" from literal 16 year olds who have barely any life experience. Like, literally, where do people in their 20s and 30s hang out online? Do they just... not?\n\n&nbsp; \n\nThe feeling of being \"too old\" for something is so weird. A part of me feels like I haven't changed at all since I was 18, but I guess I really have. The change was just slow and not very noticeable until now. Still, I feel like a boomer."

I'm thinking about Be Enchanted.\n\nThe description sounds a little vague, but I like floral smells and I *love* when just a hint of fruity fragrance is added. The idea of frosted florals and pomegranate sounds like something I would like. Plus I'm obsessed with the packaging.\n\nThere's one thing I'm worried about though. I've heard that this fragrance has musk. Musk is either a hit or miss for me. Sometimes I absolutely love it (like in Warm Vanilla Sugar and In The Stars) and sometimes I don't like it at all (Moonlight Path and Cashmere Glow). I want something that smells bold and pretty, but some of the musky scents remind me of perfume that an older lady would wear.\n\nIf it helps at all, some of my all-time favorites are Hello Beautiful, In The Stars, Sweater Weather, Live Fresh Seaside Breeze, Snowflakes and Cashmere, Cherry Blossom, and the smell of the Shea Butter hand cream. Is Be Enchanted anything like any of these? If it doesn't sound like I'll like it, is there a different one that I should try instead?"

I made some progress my freshman year by making some friends and finally starting to unmask and come out of my shell, but when the pandemic hit, everything just went to shit, I was trapped at my parents\u2019 house for 2 full semesters, my friends had all moved on with their lives by the time I came back to campus, I was never able to fully rebuild my social life, and I developed addictions to Twitter and porn to cope with the isolation.

                "body": "Any avid player of New Horizons has probably obtained, or at least seen, one of the many musical instruments in New Horizons. One might observe how revered the recipes to these instruments are, and how expensive they often are when occasionally available at Nook's Cranny. Seriously, the instruments can range from a few thousand bells to a whopping 260k bells in price. These aren't your average furniture, and you would think they wouldn't be treated as such. However, interacting with these instruments only plays a random notes that rarely even harmonizes with the game's music. I have an idea for an overhaul of this feature in favor of something still somewhat plausible, but more worth the price tag:\n\nUpon pressing A in front of an instrument, the music registration screen shows up, like it would a record player or a stereo. Likewise, all of your registered tracks would show up too. But when you select one of these tracks, you will play a small rendition of that song's melody on your respective instrument. This sounds like it would be a lot of work but it really isn't. Town tunes already show that simple melodies are not only programmable in New Horizons, but can also switch between a huge number of sound fonts (for each villager / NPC). This would essentially be that system, just with a slightly longer series of notes and a sound font for each instrument. Ideally, there could be a simple animation of your villager playing it, but I could give or take it.

I\u2019m honestly liking this stuff so I figured I\u2019d write a review. \n\nLooks: I bought smalls and honestly these aren\u2019t really that small at all. There\u2019s a few little bugs, but a lot of them are medium sized. The buds look really good. They\u2019re a nice mix between bright green and orange, and they\u2019re very frosty. Only complaint is that the buds are a bit on the dry side. \n\nSmell and taste: The smell kind of threw me off at first. It\u2019s definitely one of the stinkier strains that I tried, but it has a very unique smell that I could really put my finger on at first. Then I remembered that the strain is called thin mintz and realized that what I was smelling was mint lol. It kind of smells like a freshly picked mint leaf, with a bit of a skunky smell with it. I\u2019ve never had weed that smelled like this before and I kinda like it lol. The taste is pretty similar to me but not super strong\n\nEffects: I really enjoy the effects of this strain. It\u2019s potent and has nice hybrid effects that makes it suitable for any time of the day. It\u2019s relaxing but doesn\u2019t put me to sleep and has a nice euphoria. It\u2019s a good strain for partaking in leisurely activities or doing creative things. \n\nI\u2019ve only tried like 5 cult strains so far but I think this one is my favorite so far. Like I said I haven\u2019t seen a lot of reviews for this personally so I\u2019d love to hear what other people think of this strain.",

I get a lot of small cuts on my hands from my cat so maybe it came from him lol. Anyways I\u2019d say about a week ago I noticed redness and swelling around the wound. I figured it was infected and would probably heal up on its own since it was so tiny.\n\nThe initial swelling and redness hasn\u2019t spread or gotten worse, but it hasn\u2019t gotten better either. To be honest I shouldve covered the wound and used some antibiotic ointment or something but I kind of just left it be and forgot about it. It doesn\u2019t hurt or produce any puss. Anyways, I noticed today that the scab has fallen off and there is a black spot under the skin that\u2019s new. Is this normal? I know that black could be a sign of necrosis which has me spooked. I should also mention that I work with saltwater aquariums so my hands are probably exposed to more bacteria than the average person, but I wear gloves and always wash my hands after I\u2019m done with the tanks. I can go to urgent care after work, but I figured I\u2019d ask here first since the wound is so small and insignificant, I don\u2019t wanna waste their time if it ends up being nothing lol. Here\u2019s a picture, and I can post more if needed. Thanks! \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/p6kNDkD"

Nothing against newer bands I just feel like they sound a bit different than older ones, with some exceptions of course. Older dream pop bands like Cocteau Twins, Lush, and A. R. Kane all of have a surreal and psychedelic sound that I feel like you don\u2019t hear in a lot of new dream pop bands. \n\nI\u2019ve listened to bands like Men I Trust, Beach Fossils, and Alvvays and they\u2019re not bad bands or anything, but they\u2019re a bit more down to earth and I like it when my music makes me feel like I\u2019m in a damn fever dream lol. All of the newer dream pop bands that I\u2019ve listened to just seem to sound closer and closer to regular indie bands, just with more reverb and wispier vocals. I could just be listening to the wrong bands so if anyone has some good suggestions for new bands that fit that experimental and washed out 90s dream pop style lmk."

I began meditating and also had a reader who spoke to a female spirit guide of mine; she said to break free of the chains I have placed on myself, and to do what is best for myself, without having fear of the unknown. This, along with many other things she said about me, were EXTREMELY accurate to my life and situation. \n\nWhen I was meditating last week (post reading), something in me told me that the theme of August (my birth month) is transformation. After the reading, it really did help me rev up my inner engine and stop feeling like I am dragging my feet in the sand, and letting fear keep me at a standstill.\n\nMy main question involves my 25th birthday occurring the same date as the solar eclipse this year (August 21). I don't know much about in depth astrology, and would love to hear any insight if this may have some significance. Anything is appreciated. \u2764\ufe0f "

If the speed boost is on wearer and just while active, using a shotgun turns you into marginally faster scout with more than double the health and heavy melees at the cost of his double jump and just a 15% damage penalty. The speed boost should be lowered and there should probably be some form of survivability penalty added.",

This attachment could apply to an experience, our relationships with people, circumstances, even even to our own thoughts, emotions, choices, beliefs, health and even to conceptual things like time.\n\nWhen we have a strong expectation of how something should be, we create resistance. And what we resist, persist, resulting in suffering. For example. If we strongly expect a relationship to be a certain dynamic, when it isn't, we will experience resistance to the presented dynamic, which makes experience feelings of suffering, which makes us act in a way which only further pushes the person and the desired dynamic away.\n\nAngel numbers, finding the meaning and seeking lessons to put an end to your suffering are all forms of attachment. Attachment to the idea that there is an external solution to your suffering, which only furthers the suffering.\n\nBut the paradox is that it's when we truly give up on finding answers, when we let go of our attachments and expectations, even spiritual ones, that we then start to experience true spirituality, which is practicing non attachment, full acceptance of each and every present moment and all its dynamics, emotions and substance, without the need to change anything, we then cease suffering.\n\nTo put it simply. When we stop trying to end our suffering, we actually stop suffering. Because suffering is the result of the trying.\n\nWhen we stop trying, the suffering will slowly cease. And the more we can remain unattached and free from desire, the less we suffer and more at peace we are. It starts with intention, then becomes an action, then a habit, then a practice, then second nature, then who we are.\n\nThe beautiful thing about all of this and spirituality in general is that its not requiring us to do more. It's actually to do less.",

In this case I don't think it's right to treat them as a person and give them your guilt. It's a group and an entity that comes together to make profit, if one person in that group messes up it's just calculated into the system and turns up as profit loss, you didn't hurt them as more as you hurt a tree when punching it. Of course an employee can be reprimanded but the profit they lose talking to the employee during their hours far surpasses that one mistake they made.\n\nIf you game the system however and start doing something like that more and more that's when it turns against you and you should feel extremely guilty, that would be messing things up for every customer as the company is forced to put restrictions in place.",

                "body": "Across different generations we seem to pass on undocumented behaviors that are incredibly important culturally, this interests me and perhaps it allows me to tie them to problems we are having here.\n\nOne such behavior is engaging in a way that makes someone else feel good, if you were asked, \"what makes a woman feel good?\" or \"what makes a man feel good?\" You would have a difficult time making a list and even more so because everyone is different some approaches could achieve the opposite.\n\nBut even though this seems an impossible feat, there are many observations where I notice people doing just that, and successfully across multiple relationships , if there was such a list it would be changing constantly as you move through life meeting new people and learning new information about them. Even then it would still be hard to write this list down. \n\nSo what I think happens is that this is spread subconsciously. Have you ever just been around a person for a long time and started adopting some of their behaviors? I have.\n\nThen what happens when it doesn't get adopted, for example with people who isolate themselves, there are multiple behaviors that they're missing out on just by not being around.\nYou need practice too, both are very important.\n\nI feel like this generation has a lot of novelty to deal with, you're constantly moving and thinking and calculating and playing and watching and the stream of entertainment, the stream of work, the stream of information never ends.\nThis doesn't leave a lot of time for you to absorb other sources of information or even hang out paying full attention to your friends.\n\nThis leads to older generations being more aware of the emotional needs of another person, some of those old farts are still socially inept but many of them weave into their conversations a degree of charm that validates women they come in contact with without them sounding creepy, and this while saying some of the most inappropriate things.\n\nI don't really want to say it's about the generation someone was born in because it really isn't but we seem to lose a lot of that now because we have more distractions, and it also fits this subreddit where some of us do isolate ourselves and exacerbate the problem, I hope this was in any way helpful.\n\nAlso, don't let anyone tell you you're lazy, if life gives you lemons, it's okay to become sour, but go ahead and make lemonade anyways."

Whenever someone asked me how I felt I never had an answer ready and just said \"I dunno\" at the time I didn't even think about it it was as if they weren't actually there (my feelings). I also didn't really care about other peoples feelings and looked at them as childish and useless but ever since I struggled to connect and the desire to connect to people forced me to doubt myself and my actions.     \nthis self doubt led me to take other peoples words more seriously to the point where I now get into a sort of deciphering state picturing all the possible meanings that they may have meant, it's exhausting but interesting, you kind of start to notice that we often use words that fit two or more different meanings and both fit, aside from sarcasm and irony.    \nThe more you gain awareness of that the more you are in awe of how humans work.    \nI don't think any human is capable of being dumb, we either specialize in other areas and tend to fail in the ones we don't care about or we've been able to lead our life dependent on other people to provide intelligent decisions, a person who is good in social situations has intelligence that we shouldn't underestimate because once you lose that ability to charm someone or to make someone smile you've lost something more valuable than you would if you forgot how to do math.    \nI've come to respect feelings and now I notice how weak I actually am, nowadays I flinch when a bird flies past my window, I get anxiety when someone calls my name, and where before I could survive on nothing but bread and water for weeks, suddenly now I tend to require the food to be tasty or I literally can't eat it anymore. The amount of effort that goes into keeping your feelings stable is insane, a dessert after a meal does so much to my mood and if I don't buy myself something extra once in a while my head starts to ache.\n\nIt's so annoying, its just easier to shut the feelings out, it's not like I've made much progress connecting to people either, while I am able to predict how they feel and they tell me I'm correct, I don't really know what to do with it, being too caring towards them is weird and they don't really want you to always treat them like lambs either."

The DLC free roam areas felt large.\n\nCharacter outfits and hairstyles were the best so far.\n\nWhat they failed at:\n\nPaths are way too linear and narrow. Caves are so boring and forgetable. This overal makes the region feel tiny. If you want your world feel bigger, players need to get lost sometimes. That is one reason why in my experience Sinnoh and Kanto felt huge, because there were places where you may need an escape rope to get out.\n\nRailroading and handholding. Pokemon has been pretty bad since the beginning about railroading, from blocking a road with Wooloo, Psyduck, Fighting Pokemon, and a collapsed old drunk man. But Gamefreak has become tighter handholders like helicopter parents in their past few generations of games. I know they want more story and less sandbox, but when a game lacks story like Sw/Sh, its not as needed.\n\nThe storyline was a so boring, and the BBEG felt so sudden. Like they completely forgot to put in a bad guy, and his reason for sudden action made no sense.\n\nThe inclusion of places you cannot explore. Its just terrible game design. When you leave Motostoke city from their western gate, you see a factory you cannot even go to.\n\nAn incomplete national pokedex. I was very disappointed when some of my favourite pokes did not make the cut.\n\nWhat I can forgive:\nHigh Quality Animations. Enough said. Pokemon was never about the Quality graphics anway.",

Are there any moves/skills like Agrias' Holy Blade moves or Gaffgarion Sword moves or Dark Knight move that I can give to Denam? This is my first playthrough so I'm pretty naive about class/skills."

I also played Triangle Strategy, Fire Emblem games, and Persona on Nintendo platforms. Booting up my Switch while lying on my bed after a long day of work feels easier.\n\nIt only works for some JRPGs tho. Fire Emblem Three Houses required me to play on Dock to match the games' epicness in certain chapters, like Final map in Golden Deer route. Does Tactics Ogre Reborn have epic battles that I should keep in mind and play on Dock\\other platform to elevate the experience? Triangle Strategy doesn't seem to have those despite being in the same SRPG genre.\n\nI know it's subjective, but does Tactics Ogre Reborn feel \"better\" on other platforms such as PC, PS etc.?"

There\u2019s obviously the \u201cbasic\u201d anime style which really doesn\u2019t differentiate that much or even at all and I totally get it if you don\u2019t like that style, but there are many diverse art styles that you could give a go!

Your daughters have DEADLY eating disorders. They are NOT healthy, they\u2019re sick! They\u2019re puking their food out which destroys their gut, stomach, teeth and mind. They\u2019re afraid of eating food, so afraid to the point that they don\u2019t eat. That\u2019s not healthy!! So many people die because of eating disorders. Not only because they\u2019re mentally ill, but their body is failing them. Nobody dies because they eat cake for their birthday or maybe biweekly eat pizza. Those kids are happy and healthy, you, your husband and your kids are not. Literally everyone is telling you that what you\u2019ve done to your kids is cruel and sickening, why are you so stubborn? Why is it that psychologists, school counsellors, your parents and hundreds of people on the internet are in the wrong and \u201cunhealthy\u201d, when your behaviour gave your daughters eating disorders? You have to be delusional to still believe that what you\u2019ve done was okay. Your kids are sick because of you, YOU did this to them.",

If you recommend hard to drive headphones, i would also appreciate the recommendation of an AMP (this doesn't have to be included in the budget!)\n\nHow the gear will be used - Open Backs, WIDE sound stage. I will use them only to listen at home for flacs / mp3\n\nPreferred tonal balance - I am not sure. I want them to be very detailed. I like bass so if they're bass heavy - wouldn't be a problem.\n\nPreferred music genre(s) - Vaporwave, Ambient. If you're not sure what i mean by that, you can just look up \"\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u65e5\u306e\u8a95\u751f\" on youtube. This is my favourite album and manifests most of the instruments you will find in the music i want the headset to play.\n\nPast gear experience - Well, for travelling is use Sony's XM4 ANC Headphones, i like them, but they don't sound 'wide' and are extremely bass heavy. I have 0 experience with open backs, but i believe they have to have a wider sound stage from my past information gathering.\n\n\nThank you guys for the help in advance. I also will not be buying them straight away, but I already want to settle on something when i have my money ready for it."

Hei\u00dft im Klartext Dinge wie: ich trage gerne sehr, sehr enge Jeans und habe einen Instagram und Twitter Account, auf denen ich sexuelle Dinge poste, soweit es die Richtlinien der Plattformen eben erlauben und so weiter.\n\nNun kann es jedoch jederzeit sein, dass meine Accounts trotz Vorkehrungen entdeckt werden oder schon wurden. Und auch mein sexueller Style f\u00e4llt mittlerweile auf. Fr\u00fcher war man noch j\u00fcnger und enge Jeans, Shirts etc. waren auch bei M\u00e4nnern in Mode. Jetzt ist aber wieder weiteres mehr in Mode. Ich hab im Prinzip einfach Angst, als eine Art Perversling gesehen zu werden. Ich hab zum Gl\u00fcck recht viele Freunde, bin auch sehr freundlich und aufgeschlossen. Sozial habe ich keine Probleme. Aber die Angst ist da. Und klar, sexuell anziehen tun sich einige. Aber dann noch in Kombi mit dem Rest?\n\nNat\u00fcrlich hab ich auch schon versucht, meine \"Bed\u00fcrfnisse\" zu verdr\u00e4ngen und eine normale Sexualit\u00e4t zu haben und auszuleben. Funktioniert nicht, da es mir dann schlecht geht. Ich habe auch schon versucht, meine kinky Seite nur mit Partnern auszuleben. Aber das \u00d6ffentliche geh\u00f6rt irgendwie mit dazu.\n\nIch bin nicht 24/7 horny oder so. Auf gar keinen Fall! Ganz im Gegenteil. Aber es gef\u00e4llt mir einfach, mich zum Beispiel so zu kleiden.\n\nIch hab auch schon \u00fcberlegt, ob das was pathologisches sein k\u00f6nnte. Ich war aus anderen Gr\u00fcnden bereits in Therapie und habe das Thema mehrfach angesprochen. Da konnte man mir allerdings nicht wirklich helfen.\n\nVielleicht bekomme ich hier ja ein paar Anregungen und Ideen."

I'm a pretty attractive guy and very friendly. People like me a lot. So I feel like I have a lot of bonus points, but it's scary.\n\nSometimes I also wonder if it's just something pathological. I don't know. My sexuality is completely out of balance. Sometimes I feel no sexual desire for weeks and weeks and then it all comes up again, so fucking intensely that I can barely control it.

I was interested in modern methods of healing and progression and also interested in older and more alternative methods. I've started to meditate before it was cool, haha! Just kidding.\n\nAnyways. My very deep involvement with my spiritual journey lead to me neglecting the real world. It came to a point where I had to make a choice. Do I want to focus on material goals or do I want to focus on spiritual goals? Unfortunately the material world sucks SO MUCH energy from me. I'm going to university and I'm also working a job. I also take care of my social life. I'm basically being an adult. \n\nSadly I feel like doing that sucks all spiritual energy from me, though. And it's more than that: I don't feel much at all anymore. I'm pretty dumbed down. The material world is just too much! \n\nI remember that as a child I always thought that I never ever want to end up like most adults - empty, no soul left. Just rare moments of laughter, joy, connection and closeness. \n\nBut now I'm the same. Functioning in this world and that's what everyone always wanted from me. That's what everypne promised me would be the best way. But here I am. Empty, lonely, no soul left inside of me. Rare moments of joy and awareness and connection. But that's it. No progression. This is the machine of capitalism. I'm in it. Finally. \n\nI want to get out again! Lol!"

                "body": "Previously, i was living in china, during my highschool years i suffered horribly. I couldn't sleep, sometimes I'd sleep too much, I was an asshole to my friends and family, I'd lash out horribly, I avoided most if not all my responsibilities. In fact, I passed highschool due to the pity the teachers had for me. I did a lot of research about mental health and illnesses, I came across bipolar disorder and most of what I felt and experienced seemed to line up perfectly. I didn't believe in it because it's a very small percentage of people that have it, I thought I was just depressed and had anger issues\n\nJust before I graduated, a series of events led me to see a psychiatrist, they took a brain scan or whatever it's called and concluded that I had bipolar disorder, something about how structurally my brain is \"normal\" but my hormones are way out of wack. So i got prescribed a mood stabilizer and anti depressants. Kept taking them for the next 2 years\n\nMy mom (who's a doctor but hasn't been is the field since I was born) came to me one day and said that she's worried that the medicines are hurting me because she's noticed that I don't necessarily have mood swings but more often than not I procrastinate until it's too late and then I have a major mood shift. In the end, she concluded that I might have some sort of ADHD\n\nAnd for the most part, I believe it, what I've been feeling and experiencing lines up infinitely more with ADHD than with bipolar disorder. The only thing I can't understand is my insanely high libido\n\nSee, ever since I found out how to orgasm I've had the issue of being insanely horny, when it was at it's worst I would have to masturbate at least once every 2 or 3 days just so I can quit being so horny in my day to day life. If had friends with benefits and sexted people I shouldn't have due to it. But with the medicine, my libido lowered insanely, now I can go weeks without even being horny! I worry that if I go off my medicine for an extended period, my libido will be so high to the point where I can't function without jacking off constantly. Obviously, I can't confide in my mom about this, especially since she's very christian\n\nI don't live in China anymore, and I live on my own with my partner. I just got a new job and would love to go to a psychiatrist but it's insanely expensive and I'm overdue on my bills, I won't have enough to see a doctor, let alone buy the medicine for at least another month. Thoughts?\n\nTLDR: I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder, got medicine for it. Mom thinks I have ADHD, I think so too except I get incredibly stupidly horny when I'm off the medicine. Thoughts?"

Feels like coming off a high now that I'm done with the final book.\n\nLooking for similar books so, here's some things that I loved about Riyria.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The endearing positive characters.** Now, I love Royce, but there's plenty of brooding characters like Royce in fantasy. There are also enough characters who would be considered good because they do the right thing technically. But it's really rare to see characters like Hadrian who genuinely cares and connects with everyone in such a warm and friendly way (it's not merely about the big picture good with him), and Myron, the sweetest and most insightful guy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The female characters.** Arista is personally one of my favourites. People seem to have mixed opinions about her, but I loved her journey and thinking. I also liked that she and Modina didn't have to be warriors in the literal sense to be strong female characters. Don't get me wrong, I love the Lenare Pickerings of fantasy, but some authors make it seem like that is the *only* way to be \"strong.\" When really, there's different kinds of smart women, and it's obvious that in a patriarchal world like Arista's, you'll find all these other kinds of interesting women more often. So they should be written about too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The strong bonds and friendship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Slow and subtle romance.** So romance is often a miss with me. I'm really not a fan of obsessive love, insta-love, triangles etc, or when it overtakes the main story. That being said, a subtle amount can definitely make a story much better if done well. I like it when it's taken slow, so you can see the genuine reasons why and how characters come to care for each other. The one in Riyria *definitely* grew on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The satisfying end.** I read fantasy to escape and I like escaping to something that I can take away good things from. I really don't mind dark journeys, but at the end of the day I like some positive themes, something that ends on a good, hopeful note.   \nNothin' like a book that leaves you smiling, and Riyria left me with sooo many good feelings.\n\nSo yeah I'd really appreciate some recommendations based on this. Goodreads suggested a few but they all seem very Grimdark/mature. I'm looking for something that has Riyria-like levity.\n\n(I've also read everything by Sanderson, and I know of the Chronicles.)"

Does the Swarm plan on killing Afriel, instead of _absorbing_ him?\n\n\n2 ) Wouldn't framing the sentence like, \"I'm glad I _didn't_ absorb you, I would've missed _our_ conversation\" make more sense? Cuz if the Swarm absorbed Afriel after the conversation (\"won't _have_ to\") it wouldn't miss the conversation anyway...?\n\n\n3 ) And why do the creatures start killing each other before taking Afriel to the _defense protocol parasite thingy?_ They've could've just floated up to him and grabbed him, why kill the other creatures?\n\n\n4 ) What did the creatures mean by \"food giver give no food\" or whatever, after which Afriel tells them to take him to her (I'm assuming the other lady was the \"food giver\"), what was the point of that bit of dialogue?\n\n\nGreat episode (probably the best of the ones I've watched so far, alongside \"Bad Travelling\"), but the dialogue was kinda confusing at times."

Does it just prevent chip damage while blocking, or does it also prevent chip damage from attacks that deal chip damage if you don't perfect parry (Eg, Owl's slash after he throws firecrackers, Corrupted Monk's upward slash)?\n\n.\n\n2. Does the charm even prevent damage from perilous attacks while I'm blocking (thrusts, sweeps)?\n\n.\n\n3. And since I'm currently playing through the game for the very first time, does that mean I'm basically doing a charmless playthrough or is Kuro's charms effect permanently activated (and you get the feature to turn it off after reaching NG+)?"

I also remember every time you completed a level you're character would ride an escalator to the next level, and the music that played in the background is still burned into my head to this day. the rest of the soundtrack was also good probably but it was something about the escalator soundtrack in particular that wormed its way into my head. \n\n\nI also remember the game being massive (like 36 gigs I think) and downloading it, at least on a PS4, took forever. the game was also incredibly difficult, at least for me, and I died often. i'm not quite sure how popular it was but i remember at least the niche gaming circles on tumblr i was a part of really liking it. at least for a few months until it seemed to fall completely into obscurity and i haven't heard anyone talk about it or any news on it since. if anyone knows the game i'm talking about, and i swear at least some people do, please let me know. and if you happen to have also been keeping track of it be sure to update me about where its at now, because i'd like to know."

While i frequently watched their content, all i really remember from their videos in particular is they were always narrated using Microsoft Sam, they were most likely edited in Sony Vegas, there was one particular video i remember where at one point they made an honestly really shitty ableist joke about people with downs syndrome only to immediately reprimand themselves afterward, and i also remember one day their content seemingly just disappeared completely.\n\nwhich brings me to the potential lost media aspect. To be honest, I don\u2019t really think people will find this persons content. As far as I know, I\u2019m the only person who remembers this channels existence. I don\u2019t think even my older sibling, who I would often share videos with, remembers this. Although I won\u2019t discount the possibility that there are reuploads or archives of this Persons videos somewhere, it\u2019s highly unlikely, as I\u2019m pretty sure no one cared enough to preserve this stuff.\n\nHonestly, I just want know for sure that this channel was a real thing that happened and that I didn\u2019t just hallucinate it one day or something."

Unless when it's Christmas and there's something fancy happening in the church, but then it's more of an attraction rather ten religious visit of church. And I believe noone serious in politics is there to propagate religion, nor any head of church is important in politics. And any organised religion is dying out in here. There are people who are agnostic about that maybe some powers exist, and there isn't that much people into astrology or crystals or maybe afterlife, but again, I wouldn't call those exactly religious",

                "body": "Those are some valid arguments against breeding certain breeds, like pugs and bulldogs, but also generalizing breeders into one group is a huge over-simplification. The majority of the so-called \"breeders\" will do anything to earn a quick buck, and this includes inbreeding, which was popular when the breeds were just being created, but no reputable breeder right now would ever do. The big advantage of having a purebred is that you know what you can expect - in terms of character, needs, health etc. This can be very useful because people can get a dog that suits their lifestyle and possibilities, whether it's time, money or activity level. Taking a mutt is more of a lottery, as you don't know the size it might grow into, you can't anticipate and try to prevent diseases as well as with purebreds and, if you're adopting from a shelter, you often have to accept the additional difficulties like traumas, being fearful, having trouble staying alone, lack of proper socialization and so on. \n\nI'm not trying to discourage adopting mutts and dogs from a shelter, but from my experience, a lot of people seem to think of it as no different than buying from a breeder (aside from the cost difference). I just want to remind you, that whichever you chose you need to be prepared. Taking a purebred? Make sure you did your research on the bread and go to a certified breeder. Taking from a shelter? Make sure you are ready for any unexpected needs the dog might have. That's it",

It may also come down to your mood, energy and amount of sleep, illness and anything that might help or decrease your focus on any given day. \nOverall, the way you've written this post makes me imagine the author to be an intelligent person, and I don't think you should pay too much attention to tests like these.

Now, I know this is not uncommon - I'm in a very privileged position to even be able to apply to such a school from where I live. It just sucks because my whole life I've been the black sheep in the family, I've always barely passed classes, went most of my life on C's and most teachers I had kept telling me and my parents about their disappointment in me, about how I'm lazy and inconsistent I am.\n\nAfter years of struggling with anxiety and depression, I finally learned to dream and set my own goals, I finally gained the motivation to things, I became optimistic about my future. I managed to go from C's and D's to B's and A's. I spent a year making drafts of my personal statement, I started doing projects outside of school, I genuinely started feeling alive. And now I got an offer and it just feels like a slap in the face.\n\nI go to a very expensive high school thanks to a scholarship, which is only important for the context - all of my classmates have multiple vacation houses in different countries, they get cars for their 18th birthdays, money is never the problem. As much as I am happy when they also get into their dream schools it just sucks that I'll have to watch them study there, no loans, no debts, no anything, while I stay here.\n\nI'm feeling really depressed and frustrated, that's all I meant to say. I hate that people believe we live in a meritocratic system. This year I gave my all, my blood, sweat and tears and I feel like it was all for nothing.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or thoughts that could cheer me up a bit? I really need it right now."

EM \u201csuspects that one of the kids has behavioral issues\u201d but isn\u2019t diagnosed and doesn\u2019t plan on getting kid help. The kid is fine with everyone but her. The younger kid is starting to become just like the \u201cbehavioral one\u201d. Kids are about 6 & 9.\n\nAnyways, these kids run alllll over the neighborhood. They\u2019re out at all hours, and she has no idea where they are. They leave garbage in people\u2019s lawns. They ring my doorbell randomly, stomp my plants, and rip out/destroy my lawn decorations. They\u2019ve gotten hurt before and no one even knew it, leaving me to deal with her crying kid. \n\nOne day, I\u2019m coming down my stairs and my kids are at the window. The windows are open with the screens in but my kids are talking to someone through the screen. I\u2019m almost downstairs to see who, when I see the kid punch through the screen and start trying to CRAWL INTO MY HOUSE. My husband sees at the exact same time (kinda hard to miss a 6 year old army crawling through your window) and says loudly \u201cHey! No, Stop! He then says in a normal voice \u201cKid...I think you need to go home now\u201d. \n\nA few minutes later I get a message from EM accusing  my husband of screaming at her kid and its just a little kid and kid didn\u2019t mean to do it. She claims she heard husband yelling at the kid and the kid is super sad and doesn\u2019t understand why. I was next to my husband the  entire time. He was loud enough to get the kids attention but definitely didn\u2019t yell.\n\ntl;DR Kid destroys my screen, it\u2019s our fault that my husband tells kid to stop and go home."

                "body": "Part 2:\nOverall, I feel like I should have a better grasp of who the seekers are and why the dogs are running from them by now. For such a high-stakes opener, your prose isn't selling it for me. Especially if you want me to believe you're writing from the perspective of a dog. I'd recommend playing with choppier sentence structure and sharper wording to create a faster pace. \n\nWhen the narrator starts lamenting their disloyalty, I don't pity them or sympathize with them. I'm just confused. I never realized this dog had any loyalty to begin with, other than referring to the others as their 'pack' (which seems like a lose word considering they don't even realize they're speaking to an outsider). \n\nWhen you're opening in the middle of the action like this, I usually expect some time where the reader can 'cool off' and figure out what's happening. I thought I was getting this when the MC and the guard dog started talking. But I still don't know who the seekers are, or why they're chasing the MC. And now the MC is getting kidnapped? Overall, you aren't giving the reader much of an opportunity to catch up. \n\nI'd be very interested to see how the theme of individuality vs loyalty develops throughout this piece. But I believe it needs some edits, both on a line and content level. I'd recommend doing a bit of research on dialogue formatting.",

                "body": "We start off with a chase seen. Dog MC is running from the 'seekers'. \n\nEven if you were writing from the perspective of a very sentimental human, I'm not sure whether the prosw here matches what you're going for. The sentences are long and winding whereas action scenes tend to run choppier and more direct. \n\n**\"The pitter-pattering of paws tapping on wet soul could be heard...\"**\nYou say 'could be heard' instead of 'I heard' or 'we heard', which immidiately pulls the reader a little further back from the action. I'm not sure if distancing the reader from your narrator is what you're going for here. It could be; I don't know.\n\nI'm interested in the omniscent usage of 'we'; it seems to connotate a bit of a dog pack hive-mind which I can easily buy into. But then there are mentions of an 'I', too? A part of me wants you to pick a lane.\n\n**\"Everyone, follow me!\"**\nAs soon as I hear the voice, I'm thinking that this is a human. These dogs don't seem like talking dogs from the way your first paragraph opens.\n\n**\"My heart was racing along the pack only to be...\"**\nMore long, borderline run-on sentences that detract from what seems to be a high-stakes chase scene. \n\nKind of bothers me that the dogs call it a \"butcher's knife\". The connotation of the knife being used at a butcher's shop sounds like something the dog would understand if a. they were directly a part of human culture (which they obviously are not) or b. they spend an insane amount of time at butcher's shops. Option number 2 seems unlikely. \n\n**\"A stinging sensation in my back leg was felt...\"**\nAgain, your writing here is detached. 'Was felt' as supposed to 'I felt' connotates a degree of separation between the narrator and their story. It's not giving the in-the-moment rush of a chase scene, as I've mentioned before.\n\nAlso, this is a dog, right? Where's all the smelling? I imagine if a dog notices anything at all while they're running for their life, it's the smells around them. \n\n**\"I lifted my head against the leaves and peered my eyes...\"**\n'Peered my eyes' could definitely be rephrased. Not much else to peer with. \n\nThe following paragraphs, in which the chase slowly comes to a stop, have much of the same issues as those above. I've also noticed that your paragraphs are quite long for a scene like this. There's no punch to them. Also, since you're writing in first person, I don't know if italicizing thoughts is neseccary. \n\n**\"...piercing stare of a cobra..\"**\nHas this dog met a cobra before? This cuts down the range of where the story is taking place. Pretty sure cobras mainly live throughout  Asia?\n\nThis could be nitpicky, but dogs sweat only from their pawpads. So when the MC is waiting for their sweat to fall... I don't think it really has anywhere to fall. Then again, these are talking dogs, so there are bigger biological inconsistencies haha.\n\n**\"That was quite the strat there, lad.\"**\nWhen one character speaks and then another, their dialogue should be separated by paragraphs.\n\n**\"... aren't you the largest one in the pack...\"**\nWhen you're talking about a pack, it's generally assumed the dogs know each other. Considering this dog is considered the largest one by the MC, I imagine the MC knows them well enough to compare sizes? But the MC doesn't seem to know anything about them (ie their name) other than the fact that they're a guard dog? Maybe dogs in this world don't have names. But they know how to speak, so I'd imagine that names are a thing? \n\nAre these escaped farm dogs? That's what the distinction of guard dog makes me think, as somehow these dogs already have assigned roles. \n\nThere's an interesting contrast between the MC as an individual and the 'hivemind', as pointed out by the guard dog. This is an interesting theme to explore, especially with an animal protagonist.\n\n**\"as he elegantly danced around open grass..\"**\nI'm having trouble picturing this. By 'dancing', I imagine he's bounding around? How does he do this elegantly? \n\nAgain, you need to separate the dialogue by paragraph when the speakers switch.\n\n**\"farmhouse...\"**\nAh, okay, so they really are escaped farmdogs. And MC here is a herding breed of some sort (sheep herders do tend to be faster runners than typical 'guard dog' breeds, but that's pretty nitpicky for a story about talking dogs, I know).\n\nAre the seekers the farmhands who are trying to get their dogs back? I'm still confused why these dogs don't know each other if they worked at (presumably?) the same farm. \n\n**\"I suppose it's better to make friends than enemies in such a situation...\"**\nI've been enjoying the discussion between the MC and the guard dog and the theme of hivemind vs individual. But by now, I feel like I should have more context into what's happening. We were thrown right into the center of the action and I still don't have any background info other than these are escaped farmdogs, and somehow they don't know each other yet they're running as a pack. The seekers want to get them, for some reason.\n\n**\"A pack should always stick together...\"**\nWe're getting a completely new side to the MC before. I never got a sense of loyalty out of any of their previous internal monologues. When the other dogs were getting hurt, I never got the sense that their injuries were having a large emotional effect on the MC. They never seemed to even consider taking a leadership position. I almost feel like the voice speaking and the voice narrating are entirely different.\n\nI'm still a little confused on how they escaped the seekers but the other dogs are going to die. Did the seekers all run past them? The seekers seemed to be everywhere in the field, so I'm confused why exactly they believe so strongly that they're safe.\n\n**\"I never wanted anyone to entire the forest, you know?\"**\nSo this guard dog comes from the forest, not the farm? I'm getting kind of confused on who is talking as the dialogue is formatted oddly.\n\n**\"Before I could even process...\"**\nAlright, so the plottwist is that the guard dog is working with the seekers? And he was luring this dog out of the crowd to capture him? Or maybe he isn't working with the seekers after all but some other organization that wants these escaped farmdogs out of the forest...\n\nSo why does the MC refer to this strange dog as a guard dog? They consider the other farmdogs their pack, right, so how come they don't question the fact that they're talking to a complete stranger?\n\nBeing a dog, I'd also imagine that they would smell the person behind them's approach.",

                "body": "Overall, you've got a great start here. Strong characterization and a fantasy with a cool, interesting hook that manages to feel familiar and new at the same time. This feels marketable.\n\n**\"But his father taught him that a real man was a hunter, so that's what he would be whether he liked it or not.\"**\nThis line is definitely continuing the established tension between Conrad and his father. However, I almost feel as if it's telling too much at once? It seems as though manhood and Conrad's struggle with it is a major part of this book. So saying right away, \"Conrad struggles with the concept of manhood,\" feels like too much too soon. The theme already comes across well in subtler ways.\n\nI'm having trouble placing the time period here. They ride on horses, use muskets, etc. But the language feels modern and the mention of the Mississippi rainforests with zoo animals being from ancient times seems to point to a speculative setting. \n\nWhen it comes to the \"manhood rites\" and the title of \"alpha male\", it kinda feels like too much. I get it. They're proving their worth as men. Maybe it's the influence of popular trends in werewolf fiction, but the title of \"alpha male\" feels pretty fanfic-y. \n\nI wonder if it would be possible to cut down the number if boys travelling with Kal. There's Kal, the tall kid, and Duncan. Usually, especially when a book is just opening, I'd prefer one-on-one conversation instead of so many voices interjecting at once. As it is right now, it's pretty hard to follow who's who. Maybe two of the boys could be passive background characters, but only Kal speaks?\n\nI also feel as though more internal narration from Conrad could be beneficial to break up his argument with the three boys. \n\n**\"Those ice-blue orbs glittered...\"**\nHere, again, I'm getting a sense of fanfic-y embellishment. Personally, the use of orbs as a synonym for eyes takes me out if the story and I've heard others feel the same.\n\nOnce Conrad returns to his village, I feel as though I'm getting introduced to too many characters too fast. Focus on the really important ones. I don't think it's important to know Felix's name yet, or that he's a few years younger than Conrad. Same with Sable. It's still the first chapter, so you should stick with introducing a small handful of characters that make an impact on the reader.\n\nOf all the characters introduced in the last few pages of the sample, Mendi is the only one whose name feels important enough to know just yet. Maybe Maurice, too? They'll be time to introduce the others later if they matter to the plot.\n\nThe conflict between Conrad and the other villagers is super compelling. He used to train for the rites despite his handicap, then he stopped. It makes me wonder why (his brother's rite seems to have ended poorly... this probably factors in). While I don't understand the proper nouns just yet (ie Initiation Day), they're scattered enough that they don't pull me out of the story. Nice work.",

                "body": "Hey! First time leaving a critique so hopefully I'm doing this right \ud83d\udc4d\n\nYour opening works well for me. It establishes a troubled MC with moral qualms and a complicated family situation. Love to see it. \n\n\n**\"Turning themselves in...\"**\nThemself instead of themselves? There's only one prisoner.\n\n**\"My sweat glued clothes to skin and the steering while numbed the pads of my fingers, forcing my hands to take turns.\"**\nI've got two main problems with this sentence. The first is that I had to reread it a few times to understand that \"forcing my hands to take turns\" means the MC was trading off which hand they steer the car with. My second problem with this sentence is that it's very detached, from \"my sweat glued clothes to skin\" to \"forcing my hands\". It's like hearing the narrator talk about themself in the distant 3rd person. I'd recommend finding a more personal, clearer way to rewrite this. ie; \"My shirt was plastered to my chest with sweat and my fingertips felt numb. Every so often, I switched which hand held the steering wheel...\"\n\n**\"The dusty Nevada road... There hadn't been another car...\"**\nThese sentences feel better suited for a paragraph above. As soon as you mention the woman being fused to the asphalt, I started skimming this description to get to the part about the melted woman.\n\n**\"Sweat drenched her lilac blouse to royal blue...\"**\nThis may be clearer as lilac-to-royal-blue blouse? Otherwise, I think the structure of this sentence could use editing. Usually when there's a list like this, people use what they call parrelel structure -- \"John had his (adjective1) (noun1), (adjective2) (noun2), and (adjective3)(noun3).\" Right now, the clauses about the blouse, jeans and hair are all structured very differently.\n\nMaybe try rewriting as something along the lines of, \"Sweat drenched her lilac-to-royal-blue blouse, dark jeans, and tangled black hair sprawled across her face\"?\n\n**Her hands looked like Sabrina's...**\nThis sentence is throwing me off. It tells the reader a lot at once. First, the woman's hands look like Sabriana's. Second, Sabrina's hands look like such-and-such. Third, Sabrina and the MC used to... y'know. Love the puzzle piecing hip imagery, but it may be too much to cram into this sentence. Also, no matter how much the MC misses Sabrina, I'm not sure their mind would go directly to hip puzzle-piecing after seeing a melting woman on the asphalt. \n\n**\"I could still sketch out the way Sabrina's lips told me to leave...\"**\nLove the way you write this flashback. But with all the tag-free dialogue and minimal description leading up to it, I feel as though it could use more grounding. You set up the scenery beautifully, but now I'm starting to get white-room syndrome. Just a little bit of description could remind the reader of the setting at hand before jumping into this new flashback; ie \"Even staring at the woman melting into the roadside, I could still sketch out...\"\n\n**\"Whispered my nightmares...\"**\nConfused by this phrasing. \"Whispered my worst nightmare\", maybe? Since Sabrina was smiling, I assume their breakup was at least fairly amicable. But at the same time, I imagine she knows that the MC has nowhere else to go, so it's pretty cruel to kick them out without warning as part of an amicable breakup.\n\n**\"I had to turn myself in...\"**\nI believe this is a reference to the prisoner metaphor from before? Since that was mentioned so long ago, this throwback lost me. I'd recommend tossing on a \"to my family\" at the end so the reader remembers.\n\n**\"My destination was faint inages of retold stories, like...\"**\nI'd recommend breaking this up into two sentences after 'retold stories', so that it isn't a run-on. I really do enjoy the depiction of the narrator's detachment from their family. \n\n**\"I wish I could go home.\"**\nHere, as with the following dialogue, my problem comes up again with grounding. We're switching from flashback to dialogue to flashback without any description to keep the reader in the scene. It's kinda like late-onset white room syndrome.\n\n**\"... a missing Christian poster, a missing sister, a missing heterosexual, a missing second daughter experience, because...\"**\nI had to reread this sentence. Shouldn't it be, \"A missing Christian poster, a missing sister poster, a missing heterosexual poster, etc?\" Again with the parrelel structure, it gets confusing when each clause isn't structured the same way. Also, I think you can break this sentence  into two starting at \"Because...\" to keep it out of run-on territory.\n\n**\"My ex and I spent nights...\"**\nNo critique for this paragraph; I just wanted to share my interpretation of it to see whether it matches what you were going for. The MC knows two worlds - their repressive family and rough, sexual relationship. Although neither fit them, like Angela they want both at once - the freedom of being with their ex and the comfort of a family.\n\n**\"What time is it?\"**\nAgain with the grounding thing; I would like some description to cement me back into the scene before returning to dialogue.\n\n**\"I missed my old life, so I followed this road last night, and that's how I ended up here.\"**\nNo critique here either; I just wanted to share my interpretation. Both the MC and Angela are returning to their old lives, and in the process they must lose myself... in Angela's case she has physically lost her autonomy, while the MC is losing their freedom to express their identity.\n\nThe last line, in my opinion, packs the punch it should. It's tear-jerkingly hopeful and emotionally resonant. \n\nOverall, I love this piece. I think it's beautifully written and it tells such a compelling story in so few words. My main qualm is that I wish it were more grounded in the scene; there is some late-onset white room syndrome trickling in. A couple run-ons and structural issues here and there, but it's minor stuff, really.",

After Brie demonstrates her ability to speak to bugs, an intrigued Macy takes her under her wing. When Macy\u2019s creepy neighbor threatens to expose Macy\u2019s drinking-and-partying habits, the duo starts their own (mostly fake) witch\u2019s coven.\n\nAs long as Macy keeps her neighbor convinced that she\u2019s a witch, he\u2019ll be too scared to snitch to her already-disappointed parents. But it\u2019s all just a charade. Despite Brie\u2019s reluctance, Macy wants real witchcraft \u2013 not just cloaks and masks from Spirit Halloween. And she wants revenge against her neighbor, her parents, and everyone else who ever made her feel like a disappointment. \n\nWhile sneaking out and getting high, Brie finally feels as though she belongs \u2013 supernatural talents and all. She even enjoys crafting ominous letters to keep Macy\u2019s neighbor in check. But as Macy pressures Brie to explore her power\u2019s darker side (will beetles cast hexes if she asks nicely?), Brie\u2019s insect-manipulation proves surprisingly deadly. She must decide how far she\u2019s willing to go to appease Macy\u2019s whims, and who she\u2019s willing to hurt.\n\nTold in alternating POV, BAD INFLUENCES features the eerie, humor-ridden mystery of Sarah Glenn Marsh\u2019s THE GIRLS ARE NEVER GONE and Isabel Sterling\u2019s THESE WITCHES DON\u2019T BURN. \n\nAs an LGBTQ+ author, I\u2019ve always longed for characters who I can relate to not only because they\u2019re queer, but because they\u2019re human (and because they secretly want to summon demons).

I have been very intrigued by the Turkish nationality as it is one of those that I believed really encapsulated the ambition of the nation-state (in the sense that it was creating an identity that made sense but also was malleable, with a universalist ambition).\n\nMy father would often use the French expression \"fort comme un Turc\" and so I always had this image of them as muscular, stocky guys. It was very interesting to see the differences between the Western and Eastern parts of the country and the depth of its influence on Muslim history. It is the bridge between Europe and the Middle East and there is a sort-of of ambiguity about this nation that has always felt poetic to me. \n\nI have been worrying recently about the worsening diplomatic relations between Turkiye and France (and the EU in general) and I wanted to state that I am sorry to see a more radical and fundamentalist political resurgence in the country. I think it is possible and necessary to recompose the discourse about national pride and ambition. There is no point in being overly ashamed or overly dishonest about your history. And there is also no point in disregarding the achievements and awfully complex nature of the Turkish national ambition.\n\nI understand that some discussions and conflicts are particularly hard to resolve, but if Turkiye is facing these difficulties it is, in my point of view, completely their own fault. An ethnic nationalism is simply a broken nationalism. So I like Turks a lot, more as an idea and ideal, and not as much as a strict ethnic reality.",

On ne sait pas par quelle sagesse ni de quel danger l'empirisme de nos traditions nous aide et nous d\u00e9fend. Nous ne sommes pas les justiciers d'un monde qui nous est \u00e9tranger. Nous fran\u00e7ais avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu cet orgueil de croire nos valeurs sup\u00e9rieures en allant \"civiliser\" l'Afrique. Laissons-donc les gens se civiliser eux-m\u00eames et tracer leurs propres chemins humanistes. Je n'ai aucune appr\u00e9ciation pour les europ\u00e9ens qui pensent intervenir \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger au nom d'un id\u00e9al culturel et social dont ils sont rarement critique ou analytique. Rappelons nous de la violence de notre propre chemin et comprenons que nous ne sommes ni unis ni clairvoyants. Nous sommes juste puissants. \n\n5) Un boycott inefficace, pour des principes peu l\u00e9gitimes. \nUn boycott sportif efficace c'est celui ordonn\u00e9 par un \u00e9tat qui emp\u00eache toute sa population de participer et qui a un impact \u00e9conomique, ou alors celui qui interdit un pays de participer. En fait celui qui ne regarde jamais les matchs qui d\u00e9cident que \"cette-fois ci\" il ne les regardera pas non plus, \u00e7a ne se remarque vraiment pas. Cela ne veut pas dire qu'il ne faut pas boycotter. Boycotter pour le principe cela peut tout \u00e0 fait se comprendre. Mais si le principe c'est la justice social dans le monde eh bien pour toutes les raisons d'au-dessus, \u00e7a ne convainct pas trop. Et le boycott individuel ne marche que s'il est li\u00e9 \u00e0 une baisse de consommation. Je n'ai pas encore rencontr\u00e9 une seule personne qui boycott la coupe de monde qui aime le foot. Et au contraire l'\u00e9norme publicit\u00e9 d\u00e9nonciatrice aux US semble avoir au contraire fait na\u00eetre un int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le sport. Donc... \u00c7a m'a l'air contre productif en plus d'\u00eatre inefficace.\n\n6) La coupe du monde a un bon impact sur la justice et la paix social dans le monde. \nLes joueurs de l'Iran et des USA qui se prennent dans les bras. Les chinois qui se rendent compte de leur emprisonnement gr\u00e2ce aux images de la coupe du monde qui montre la libert\u00e9 des autres peuples. Le moment d'un jeu o\u00f9 les r\u00e8gles du jeux sont les m\u00eames pour tous, et o\u00f9 m\u00eame des pays et des peuples tr\u00e8s d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s peuvent finir au sommet du monde. Cela va de pair avec le fait que l'origine des joueurs est souvent prol\u00e9taire ou d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e. C'est l'id\u00e9al de l'enfant des bas quartiers qui atteint le sommet de la tour d'ivoire. C'est un sport du peuple, de tous les peuples. C'est un sport qui offre une ar\u00e8ne ou les h\u00e9ros ne sont pas les plus riches ou les plus forts. C'est un \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui permet l'amour de la nation et l'\u00e9lan patriotique, sans morts ni bless\u00e9s, sans haine de l'autre. C'est un moment de rassemblement humain fort et sinc\u00e8re. C'est un moment qui rend fier et qui r\u00e9conforte. Pour moi, certes, mais aussi pour des milliards de gens autour de la plan\u00e8te.\n\n7) Que faire alors sinon que vivre ? \nC'est dur. C'est un casse-t\u00eate. C'est le probl\u00e8me de notre g\u00e9n\u00e9ration et de notre \u00e8re. C'est peut \u00eatre un probl\u00e8me humain. C'est un autre d\u00e9bat. C'est tous les d\u00e9bats. C'est peut \u00eatre une question mal pos\u00e9e. C'est peut-\u00eatre une question qui ne se pose pas. Quitte \u00e0 mourir et rejoindre l'abysse \u00e9ternelle, le paradis ou l'enfer un jour, autant vivre le plus grand des spectacles avec les quelques amis que l'on s'est fait, autant vivre un moment humain. Ce n'est peut \u00eatre pas bien, pas juste, pas malin, pas durable... Mais c'est un moment, et c'est de la vie.\n\nSauf si on s'en branle du foot et que \u00e7a saoule.\n\u00c7a c'est l'argument que je trouve le plus solide en fait. \"le foot fait chier\". Bah \u00e9coute, t'as pas tort ni raison, t'as bien le droit d'en avoir rien \u00e0 foutre en tous cas. Et les autres trouveront un autre moment humain \u00e0 c\u00e9l\u00e9brer avec toi, c'est certain. Il y a le rugby, les JO, ou \u00e0 part le sport il y la musique, les festivals... Y'a pas de mal \u00e0 avoir tes propres go\u00fbts.\n\nTLDR : Le boycott esth\u00e9tique oui, le boycott moral non. Changer soi m\u00eame et faire de l'autocritique avant de se croire l\u00e9gitime \u00e0 critiquer l'autre. Proposer une vraie alternative plut\u00f4t que d'affronter les pierres qui tombent de l'\u00e9difice dont nous sommes en grande partie les architectes.",

Je suis au courant de l'effet d\u00e9vastateur en terme d'\u00e9mission de CO\u00b2 de cette absurdit\u00e9. Et il se pose en effet la question de comment s'assurer que cela ne se reproduise pas. \n\nMais! Quand on se plonge de mani\u00e8re un peu s\u00e9rieuse dans ce projet on se rend compte de la complexit\u00e9 de l'initiative, pour une grandes quantit\u00e9s de raisons. \n\n1) Des fran\u00e7ais sont responsables, mais intouchables. \nAvant d'aller faire justice \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger il faut d\u00e9j\u00e0 se rendre compte que les fran\u00e7ais n'ont m\u00eame pas eu le bras assez long ni unanime pour retenir l'influence corrompue de leur propres compatriotes (Zidane et Platini), et que l'aura de gloire qui entoure les plus responsables sont exactement ce qui a attir\u00e9 les Qataris \u00e0 chercher leur soutien. Ces gens l\u00e0 ont un r\u00f4le positif en France au del\u00e0 de leur h\u00e9ro\u00efsme sportif, notamment parce que l'\u00e9quipe de foot de France est un grand atout pour la paix social et la bonne entente entre les fran\u00e7ais \"black, blanc, beur\". Critiquer Zidane c'est critiquer entre autres un symbole cl\u00e9 du mod\u00e8le de l'immigr\u00e9 devenu Francais profond et \u00e9minent. C'est un mod\u00e8le du projet de l'assimilation \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise telle que l'aime tant de politiques et penseurs puissants. \n\n2) Un probl\u00e8me d'hypocrisie historique et \u00e9conomique. \nLes \u00e9normes projets mortels, il y en a eu un paquet et dans tous les pays, et le boycott par des europ\u00e9ens appara\u00eet de mani\u00e8re \u00e9vidente aupr\u00e8s de ceux qui ont subit leur domination comme une hypocrisie malicieuse, et ne convainct donc malheureusement pas. Le canal de Suez, de Panama, les d\u00e9placements de populations, les travaux forc\u00e9s par l'empire fran\u00e7ais, les exploitations des ouvriers europ\u00e9ens dans les mines et dans les usines... Tant de souffrance accept\u00e9e par les europ\u00e9ens pour en arriver \u00e0 se d\u00e9velopper nie leur l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 \u00e0 critiquer des pays en voie de d\u00e9veloppement qui ne font que les imiter. C'est les europ\u00e9ens et les am\u00e9ricains qui ont d\u00e9finit les r\u00e8gles du jeu de ce monde, capitalistes et expansionnistes. Les Qataris ne font que jouer \u00e0 un jeu que nous avons invent\u00e9, pour notre propre b\u00e9n\u00e9fice.\n\n3) Les Qataris sont face au mur\nIls ne repr\u00e9sentent \u00e0 peine plus de 10% de la population pr\u00e9sente de leur propre pays. Le p\u00e9trole a \u00e9t\u00e9 une sorte de cadeau miracle qui cache un pi\u00e8ge maudit. Leur p\u00e9trole va s'\u00e9puiser mais il a attir\u00e9 une foule de migrants. Le Qatar n'est pas seulement in\u00e9quitable parce qu'il est cruel, mais parce que sa richesse explosive et son immigration sont toutes les deux extr\u00eamement jeunes. Comment transformer ces p\u00e9trodollars en richesse durable et en d\u00e9veloppement du territoire ? Comment faire pour ne pas s'\u00e9crouler sous le poids de cette richesse, comment ne pas s'\u00e9crouler soudainement apr\u00e8s son \u00e9puisement ? L'Ouest tout entier prend ses cachets via ses ing\u00e9nieurs, ses industries, ses conseillers \u00e9conomiques et ses architectes, ses universit\u00e9s, mais comment le Qatar peut-il faire pour ne pas finir en crise profonde compte tenu de la nature de son \u00e9conomie, de sa d\u00e9mographie, et de sa g\u00e9ographie ? Ils ont fait le choix des m\u00e9ga-projets, du tourisme, des clubs de foots, d'une ville hub et du transport a\u00e9rien qui br\u00fble du p\u00e9trole et ce en ayant pris des conseils venus des sp\u00e9cialistes Occidentaux. D\u00e9sastre et fiasco ? Oui c'est bien possible. Mais ne nous moquons pas d'une situation dont nous profitons et que nous n'avons pas \u00e0 vivre ni risquer\n\n...",

There is lots of knowledge in traditions to be explored, and we first need to learn from them before giving them up for something better, or we might lose precious information and know-how. \n\nBut otherwise sure, I agree.\n\nMy comment was more based on the point that meat is still a huge food source and that giving it up wouldn't lead to much plant crops, and that right now we would just be losing an enormous amount of food production and we can't afford that. But we still can do a lot to transition entire societies to have a different relationship to meat and food consumption, which includes of course to eat less meat.",

She knows this and is okay with it. However, her insecurity makes her feel unattractive or rejected by me sometimes due to the fact that I don\u2019t experience sexual attraction the way most others do. \n\nHer (quite clever) solution to this is that I tease her more, but sort of boss her around with it and tell her she\u2019s not allowed to get \u201cexcited\u201d. She\u2019s given me lots of other hints that she may be wanting to explore a sort of D/S style relationship with me, and I\u2019d love to try it out because it sounds like something I might enjoy. \n\nMy concern is, we\u2019re both very inexperienced sexually and have zero bdsm type experience, and I have no idea how to say these sort of Domme type things without getting embarrassed or sounding silly. I can walk the walk but I very much do not know how to talk the talk. I\u2019m autistic and tend to take things seriously, and I could take it as a theatrical exercise, but she is a bit giggly and I can\u2019t keep a straight face (pun intended) if she can\u2019t.\n \nTl;dr how do I speak as a Domme without making a fool of myself and how do I do it without taking it too seriously?

In fact, it seems like the more excited I am the more stress it gives me when things go slightly different than planned.\n\nIt makes me feel really guilty, because I\u2019m really upset when she hasn\u2019t technically done anything wrong, and on one hand I\u2019m trying to be reasonable but on the other hand sometimes it\u2019s just too much for me to handle and I start crying or negative stimming (such as SIB) and it\u2019s slightly distressing for her but she also doesn\u2019t know what to do about it because she simply can\u2019t manage her time to my preferred schedule whatsoever, and she can\u2019t really comprehend why her type of scheduling is so unpleasant for me. It\u2019s a cultural difference, too, so I really don\u2019t want to push my preferred schedule on her, so I just don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nDoes anyone else experience things like this?"

I have almost all magazines, I have all Bobbleheads, and so when I go to my stash to grab any kind of aid out, I am scrolling for what seems like forever. Can they either go to the bottom of the regular stash (since we can grab them from the display cases if need be) or a separate tab be made for them?\n\nI just think the stash could be organized a little better. \n\nApparel should be Armor + Clothing in separate tabs. I think this should be apparent for player vendor camps as well. You see 20 pieces of \"armor,\" go to the player's camp, and you are met with everything but armor. Halloween costumes. Spacesuits. You name it.\n\nAid should be Chems, Food/Drinks, Bobbleheads/Magazines. That would help as well with the whole display case thing. \n\nI'm also confused as to why Stable Flux are Junk and Serums are aid in inventory (rightfully so) but appear as \"misc\" at player vendors. Not as necessary but some consistency would be nice, yes?\n\nLastly, and maybe this has changed since I tried to do it, why can we not put Jangles the Moon Monkey in a display case? I went to do a space themed display when the feature first came out and, alas, Jangles was not an option."

Many people are giving the argument, \"how will you recognize racism if you are colorblind.\" Well, if universities, for example, made it twice as hard for red-heads to get in, people would recognize it and this would be very unjust. It's the same case with colorblindness. People aiming to follow a color blind ideology can obviously still recognize if people are treated differently based of race, and they'll be ardently against it. "

Honestly, I can usually spot the kids who have a lot of screen time almost immediately. Yes, some of those can be educational for kids, but I\u2019d rather my kids get their education elsewhere, especially since half the \u201ceducation\u201d put out these days is not education I want my kids receiving at the moment. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s no place for technology at all. Of course there\u2019s plenty of great ways to use it, and we\u2019ll have to adjust and figure out the right balance as the kids get older, year by year. Right now, though, our favorite way to bond in our house is reading books together. We read literally all the time and they all learned to love books while still infants. To me, the love of reading and learning is the most important thing for the success of a child.",

Just simply being, while looking around and breathing. What I've learned is that this actually how our brain & subconscious process emotions as well as what happened to us. We need to do something physically demanding while our mind is just in idle. This gives us time & space to process our emotions. Which is probably why a long hike or a long walk without any music or audio books or other distractions can feel really good. Scary emotions and thoughts come up, a lot of them I haven't had a chance to process. After those hikes with my best friend, I feel like I had that clear of mind away from former nstepparent to be able to process some of the things that happened to me. It made things easier for me to dispel the \"fog\" that had blinded and binded me for so long. \n\n\nI think that a lot of scary things do come up because our experiences were extremely scary and violent. It gave me a lot of perspective and just time to breathe. I was able to relax and just be. That's what I feel is taken away from us when it comes to being narcissistically abused. We don't have time and space for ourselves to just be without the fear or the distractions of a narcissists' attempt at getting nsupply from us. At 2 years after my escape, I need so much time and space for silence. Cleaning the house without any music or distractions does this too. Just some tips for you all, I know it's hard. Stay strong."

If you've ever wondered all the crazy-making & drastic things your nparents/nfamily does after you extricate yourself from them & their control by going NC[no contract], there's a name for it. It's called **post-separation abuse**. It's a way for them to regain & keep control. This is why it's so difficult with nparents after leaving. This is what they do to regain nsupply[aka validation of their worth & existence] from survivors. Be aware of it. Even if it's used more in context of divorce or partner separation, it happens to us too. Control is a way to get nsupply for nparents/family. Look into it, you'll see that it's all the tactics that nparents do. Prepare yourself & add the info into your escape plan. Understand that post-separation abuse is coming. Find peace in knowing that you're going to know their playbook because you can prepare for it. \n\n\n[Post-separation abuse info in divorse situations](https://www.highconflicteducationandresources.com/post-separation-abuse)\n\n[Common examples of Post-separation abuse](https://sosviolenceconjugale.ca/en/tools/sos-infos/6-forms-of-post-separation-violence)"

I used 220 grit before primer, just to make the case's surface rough so that the primer adheres.\n\nAfter primer and in between the colour coats, I used a high grit sandpaper, about 1000 or 1500 grit. I only lightly used sandpaper in between colour coats, but if I did a bad spray paint layer like I did for the primer and sorta the second last colour coat, I went over it with both the 400 and 1500 afterwards to smooth it out afterthe spray paint was touch dry.\n\nI also removed the sanded off paint by using a dry cloth to make sure I dust it off before spray painting a new layer. \n\nI did this for almost a whole day, from afternoon to evening, then dried it for 24 hours.\n\nHope it helps \ud83d\ude01",

So essentially I went from dark to light anyway \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nWhat really matters is that you sand the surface of the case carefully and have the first layer (etch primer) fully coat the case until it's opaque. I did about 3 coats of this and drying time in between as directed by the spray can I used, and it was fine.\n\nThen after drying for 24 hours, I spray painted with a light pink spray paint and also did 3 light coats of this, drying and sanding in between then drying for 24 hours.\n\nI didn't end up doing a clear coat because when I tested it, it turned the light pink slightly yellowish so left it matte as is. I think if I chose a more vibrant and deeper shade it would have worked out, but I preferred the matte look.",

I sanded with different sandpaper grits before primer, and also in between spray painting steps when coat was dry. Then spray painted even coats and again waited until each coat dried then sanded it.\n\nIt is a time consuming process though, wouldn't recommend if you don't have time and/or patience to wait for coats of paint to dry as this process cannot be rushed.",

I find if you narrow it down further this way, you can at least make a better decision in choosing a cooler based on your needs. It might be helpful to look up some reviews online, or even searching in reddit so that you can make an informed decision, then come back here once you have it narrowed down to about 2-3 choices.\n\nPersonally, I would stick with well-known brands that have a history of making CPU coolers and have been used succesfully by other people without any issues. I commonly see Cooler Master and be quiet frequently mentioned in buildapc, so maybe have a look at those and see which ones you like best out of them.",

People also note my distinct skill at developing seemingly crazy analogies that actually work.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nWell, I don\u2019t really *have* any diagnosis, but I\u2019ve had an infamous past of anger issues. To put things into perspective..\n\nI\u2019ve opened a very fast auto-clicker macro,\n\ninfiltrated a Garry\u2019s Mod server,\n\nspawned in hundreds of thousands of nukes,\n\nand crashed my friend\u2019s games.\n\nbecause I was accused of being too loud, and annoying in a discord group call. \n\nThis was 2 years ago and I\u2019ve improved since then, but that\u2019s the best example of my anger issue, soo... it\u2019s staying here.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nMy upbringing is a weiiird subject, but I guess I\u2019ll *try* to summarize it. Essentially, I\u2019m in a military family that\u2019s surprisingly laid back, and they had a structure for me and a curfew and things like that, but they weren\u2019t very strict about it. My parents are Christian, but they didn\u2019t try to force those beliefs on me. With all that open room to be myself at home, my upbringing became more prevalent in areas outside of the house. The most significant location I\u2019ve \u201cgrown up\u201d at is actually school. See, I didn\u2019t really have the best childhood; not because I had a bad home (quite the contrary), but because school was a personal hell. That is the place my anger issues really developed, and it was **bad**. I was such ticking time bomb that I was often nicknamed \u201chulk smash.\u201d I was one of the biggest troublemakers in elementary, to the point where I\u2019d kick someone in the jaw for teasing me during tag. As time has passed though, it\u2019s got much better, and the only person that changed me, is *me.* I chose to change my attitude around the time of high school, because I slowly realized what I was doing to others, and that it was extremely selfish. In school, I\u2019ve made a radical shift from an antisocial asshole, to an eccentric smile-giver. It\u2019s weird how things work out that way. I\u2019m glad I eventually learned and overcame my toxic mentality, because when other people are happy, *I\u2019m* happy. \n\nOh, and uh, outside of school I spent most of my childhood inside my house on a computer in a single room. Forgot to mention that.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI currently lack a job, because in all honesty I\u2019ve just kind of been a bit lazy; I admit to it. The reason I *am* lazy though is because getting a job just, feels inherently scary and intimidating. It isn\u2019t doing tasks that I hate, because I\u2019ll willingly do work if it occupies me and keeps time passing. The problem lies more in how I perceive other people in the workplace. I can\u2019t for the life of me take criticism without *also* taking it to heart. I\u2019m afraid of being judged, and even if people aren\u2019t, I know they could be internally chuckling about mistakes I make. It drives me into a brick wall of paranoia whenever I mess up in front of people, and it\u2019s been the reason I\u2019ve avoided the unknown for a long time. \n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nWell... It depends. If it\u2019s been a long day, then going home and just relaxing will feel much better than hanging out more. Once I wake up I\u2019d feel refreshed and ready to talk to people again. The problem lies in that once I\u2019m refreshed and *not* worn out, activities alone feel odd. Every time I\u2019m gaming on my computer with no one to talk to on discord, the world feels much smaller and emptier than it once was. There\u2019s just something about being able to rebound quips to another person as I play, that feels more full than talking to some random sheep in Minecraft, yknow? Friends give me meaning in an otherwise meaningless world. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m *social* though, blegh.. I need alone time, I just find people fascinating I guess.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI prefer indoors activities since I\u2019ve been acclimated to PCs for pretty much my whole life, but that doesn\u2019t mean I hate outdoor activities. In fact there\u2019s one inparticular that\u2019s meant a ton to me over the years. Marching band. It\u2019s made me a much better person overall than if I didn\u2019t do it, and it\u2019s given me memories I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. It\u2019s given me so much friends, and more personal meaning than a computer ever has. *Plus it\u2019s a huge time killer, so I spend less time lounging around wondering why I\u2019m so bored.*\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nOf course I\u2019m curious when I want to be. I only am when I choose to be though. If I don\u2019t want to know something, I tune it out foreeeverrr. I get a ton of ideas that are conceptual, and often the only way I\u2019d ever be able to execute the ideas are through roleplay. Often my thoughts will loop and I\u2019ll end up thinking about the same situations over and over until I eventually seeped it of all its worth. I\u2019ve never been one to switch from a subject I really want to talk about. It\u2019s made me a bit of an acquired taste. \n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI do enjoy a leadership position, and I think I would be good at it. I wouldn\u2019t want to be like those bosses you see in the crummy 9-5 jobs though. I\u2019d want to be a leader that is assertively kind, giving solid direction with tact. I\u2019d aspire to be like what I see in band directors. Meticulous, yet big picture, and able to direct people in a way that is bigger than our sum, while still being able to make it fun all the while.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nWell, yes but actually no. Naturally, calling me coordinated is like taking the white from snow or the three from stooges. As my truest self, I am **not** that coordinated, and working with my hands has never been my forte. However, because of marching band, I\u2019m more coordinated than I\u2019ve ever been. Of course I still get tunnelvision and sometimes I forget stop signs exist but I\u2019m doing better now. \n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI guess you could call me artsy fartsy, but not in a visual way. I\u2019ve always wanted to draw but I never got around to learning it. Despite that, I do make chiptune music on my free time, and music is art in its own right. I\u2019ve always enjoyed chiptune because of its charming limitations. I also enjoy listening to artistic pieces of music, and really feeling the emotion behind it. I prefer classical, and jazz.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI like to think my opinion on the past, present, and future are rather balanced, but the truth is I may or may not have a love-hate relationship with my past. I love it because I have a lot of fond memories and it\u2019s the reason I\u2019m me, but like... *I was a piece of shit* back then so, like.. eh..? I kind of despise it and kind of love it. \n\nThe present is a fascination of mine, and I enjoy sometimes saying \u201cfuck it\u201d and doing something crazy, but other than that I kind of suck at being spontaneous. \n\nThe future is where my mind rests typically, and I\u2019m usually thinking ahead about what I\u2019m going to do, whether that\u2019s short term or long term. I find the future the *most* interesting, because thinking about what could happen is really fun. \n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI\u2019ll **always** be willing when others request my help. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is, I love being a help, because it makes their day easier and mine more enjoyable! *...Most of the time..*\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI mean.. not really? It\u2019s fun to engage my *\u201dlogic\u201d* once and a while, but I don\u2019t live and breathe it. I love making analogies, I guess, and I overanalyze things a lot. Those are *kind of logical* right..?\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s on my D tier of priorities. I just kind of, get OCD sometimes and that\u2019s the most efficient I get. I am not productive unless I\u2019m at my best. I don\u2019t *like* being unproductive, but I can\u2019t really help it. I think a lot more than I do.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nSometimes I accidentally do it. Often if I want something my way, I\u2019ll aaaccidentally emotionally sway them towards what I\u2019m favoring. It just, happens. Sometimes it\u2019s guilt tripping and sometimes I just make what I want to do sound more fun. Things like that. I try to not do it though.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nMy hobbies? Hmm... well, I play very specific games on my computer like Team Fortress 2, Minecraft, DS ROMS, and Garry\u2019s Mod. I stick to the games I\u2019ve known for a long time because I always find them to be the gifts that keep on giving. I roleplay because testing out unlikely scenarios as a character is fun. I also make chiptune music as I\u2019ve said before, because I just, love music. It\u2019s simple as that. \n\nOh, and is talking a hobby?\n*nervous laughing..*\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI enjoy classes involving creativity, such as symphonic band, and I\u2019m enthusiastic when project assignments give me the opportunity to present it through any forms. Often I\u2019ll take the opportunity and make a crazy video with lots of **wacky editing.** I do it mostly to get laughs out of people while still portraying the project. Other than that, I also prefer classes like math because it\u2019s relaxing to think in a system like that, I\u2019m indifferent with memorizing,\nand I really suck at learning with my hands, like.. **really** suck. Just ask my interior design teacher from sophomore year.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nWell, this is a thin line we\u2019re standing on. People tend to plan, *or* improvise most of the time. Probably why it\u2019s a question in the first place, but I tend to be on that thin line. I usually make a generalized, undetailed plan, and the rest unfolds as I go. As long as I have an idea of what I\u2019m doing, and I conjure up key things that need to be done, I am fine. I can\u2019t work within the limits of organized plans, but I\u2019m overwelmed if everything is in the air. I need a balance between them.\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nProfessionally, I aspire to be 1 of... a couple things. I either plan on majoring in music, literature, or.. well, IT as a backup incase all goes wrong. I\u2019ve also been told I would make a great teacher, so I\u2019ve kept that as a possibility, regardless of major and such. I don\u2019t care too much for the paychecks I get, as long as it\u2019s good enough to pay the bills. If I can be happy at work and at home? I\u2019ll be at peace professionally.\n\nPersonally, it\u2019s a bit more complicated. Because of my... **regrettable** past, I can\u2019t help but aspire to a kinder, more tactful version of myself, and I\u2019ve come a long way! I just wish I was able to keep my anger in check better.. And trust me, every time I have an outburst and ruin my friend\u2019s moods, I have a mental and emotional breakdown and think I\u2019m a monster who should rot in the bloody depths of hell. My self improvement is a biiiiit rough right now, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m all for personally. Self improvement, whether that\u2019s physical, mental, or emotional! *Or all of 3!* I just have to learn to appreciate who I am currently, which is a hard task. I consistently struggle with horrible self-worth.\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nThe easiest one to answer is what I hate. I hate self-centered people, I hate stubborn people (also includes me soo...), I hate mindless drones who thrive in stereotypes, I hate politics because it\u2019s full of lies, uhh.. I hate many things actually. There is so many things I absolutely despise it\u2019s actually kind of ridiculous. I guess one of the things I especially hate, is.. me. That changes once and a while and I\u2019m content with who I am, but as of right now, I hate who I am. **oh!** And fuck people who lie. *Yeah, I see you Matt. You know who you are*\n\nI absolutely fear things such as the unknown, and failure, which go together and tend to brew a whole new kind of disaster whenever I\u2019m forced into new activities, especially socially. I also fear that everything I\u2019ve believed in was wrong. I would say I fear bugs, because I do, but that isn\u2019t really the point of this question.. so...\n\nThings that make me extremely uncomfortable are gore, and conflicts between people. Whenever I see even a drop of blood, I tend to breathe hard, I tend to sweat and feel nauseous, I tend to panic a lot. For example when my sister cut one of her cockatiel\u2019s nails a little too deep, I heard the bird yelp, and when I saw the blood, I practically got PTSD there and then. I can\u2019t handle it well, I felt that birds pain. Those are 2 hours that could\u2019ve felt tolerable, but I felt consistently horrible for a long while. I was out of it, and I was in like... phantom pain. I also hate people arguing because it has the same effect on me. I am mental disheveled whenever discord occurs (like, the word not the app.. or the character). Oh, and my own anger makes me feel uncomfortable. You could already guess that though.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nMy highs in my life are when I finally don\u2019t have a care in the world, and I can just let loose and have fun with my friends and not overanalyze for once. I love it when I can just joke around and have a good time. Sadly these moments don\u2019t occur often, but other highs can also be when I finally vent my creativity into something and make a personal gem that I\u2019ll remember. Most of them come from school projects. Awkwarrrd-\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n...Umm.. Do I *really* need to answer this? I think you can gather what the lows are if you read the previous questions.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI am the ultimate daydreamer, and can space out in the middle of a conversation. The world disappears once I go down the rabbit hole of contemplating something. It\u2019s like a bottomless pit. I won\u2019t be escaping it any time soon. The only thing that can snap me out of it is if I am able to fully comprehend what I\u2019m contemplating, or something in the environment actually manages to get my attention, whether that\u2019s something, or someone.. heheh.. *I space out too much..*\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nWell, I can\u2019t guarantee I would know exactly what I think about, but I can give you a pretty general answer. I\u2019d be contemplating something very deeply. Usually it\u2019s pretty out there, I\u2019ll be thinking about something deep. Like finding my own meaning in life, or what happens when I die, or hell, universe theories and likely future scenarios of the world and all this other shit. I can\u2019t answer completely because I\u2019d be thinking about so much. If I didn\u2019t starve to death or dehydrate I\u2019d probably sit there for a while, like.. weeks. occasionally I\u2019d realize I\u2019m in a blank room, but usually the blank room would just be merely canvas of my endless and restless mind. It never stops.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIt takes me a long time to make an important decision, because I have to consider everything before deciding what the best decision is. Once I make it, I may stick to it if I truly believe in the decision I made. However, sometimes I may regret the decision, seeing a more ideal, and superior option afterwards. As they say, you can always look at situations with perfect vision, **after** the fact.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nEmotions have practically been integral in my development as a human being, and I wouldn\u2019t trade anything for them. Feeling sad sucks, but it\u2019s what makes feeling happy good. However, often I won\u2019t understand how I\u2019m feeling and I just need a lot of time to really unravel my spaghetti bowl of emotions. If I fully comprehended my emotions, I would\u2019ve fixed my mental instability years ago. Doesn\u2019t make emotions any less important for me. I\u2019ll take a philosophical meaningful conversation over small talk and debates any day.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nOhh boy... constantly.. I can\u2019t help it! I have to keep the conversation going, and I space out too often to warrant listening to them all the time, I need some way to help them realize I actually give a shit. I tend to be a bit of a bad listener sometimes..\n\nOh, and sometimes I don\u2019t care but I wanna seem like I do, so there\u2019s that.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI break them whenever authority steps out of line, and when it\u2019s pretty agreed upon that it\u2019s stupid. For example, my band teacher makes us wear bell covers in class (because covid), so we can play in class. That\u2019s fine and all but... I play *french horn* in that class.. \n\n**HOW DO THEY EXPECT ME TO TUNE?** HELL, the spit comes out of the **tuning slides** most of the time.. **NOT the bell.**\n\nNeedless to say I broke that rule and the other French horn player followed in my footsteps. Basically, screw stupid rules.\n\n\n\nAight, have fun typing me! Seriously, like... that\u2019s a lot of information, I know. Sorry about that."

The instructions are very clear. \n\nIt was nothing like the negative reviews you see, and I understand there are case by case scenarios but tbh\u2026there\u2019s another side to the story and remember someone is getting into YOUR car with YOU driving and they don\u2019t know you at all. They can\u2019t be chatting you up and asking you your life story. Would you not be nervous to hop in a strangers car that doesn\u2019t have their license? No. You don\u2019t know how good they are. \n\nEveryone in the facility is just a regular person doing their job and even if I failed, as long as the instructions are clear and questions are answered I\u2019m good to go. They cannot *not* do their job, they\u2019d have their jobs on the line. If you don\u2019t meet the standard it\u2019s a fail. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t like *you* it\u2019s that they are doing their job. \n\nMake sure you look with your head and just adhere to the speed limit. Check your mirrors and don\u2019t do anything illegal.\n\nBut yeah, don\u2019t fall for negative reviews there\u2019s definitely another side to the story. Don\u2019t let it scare you, you\u2019re gonna do fine :)"

The speed limit is 80! \n\nNow, we have to use situational awareness and think about what the smart thing to do in that situation is because driving slow is a hazard and I don\u2019t want the examiner to feel uncomfortable and I also want to pass. \n\nThe smart thing to do would be to pass them, but you can\u2019t just pass them unless the instructor asks?

I started low at 5 mg and I have progressed to 30 mg.\n\n\nAll to say, I have yet to feel any benefits. It\u2019s hard to not let it get to me, as 30 mg is the cut off for what my insurance will cover, so any higher dose will be out of pocket. \n\nAlso, I thought surely 30 mg would be therapeutic. To me, it seems like a lot but maybe I\u2019m na\u00efve. The only advantage I\u2019ve been able to notice is that I have an easier time waking up in the morning and don\u2019t feel sluggish in the afternoon (I\u2019m taking extended release), but that\u2019s it. My mind has never \u201cquieted\u201d and that\u2019s the main symptom I was hoping to treat. \n\nI feel helpless/frustrated because I see so many posts with people prescribed lower doses talking about how amazing it felt to finally not have a bazillion lines of thought at once, that they could actually concentrate and were able to feel motivation to work past their executive dysfunction\u2026\n\nNone of this has been the case for me thus far. I\u2019m not giving up, I understand that some of us need a higher dose in order for the medication to be effective. I guess I\u2019m just here to vent my frustration over it and wishing I could see benefits because taking medication in general is one of my least favorite things to do and so it\u2019s hard for me to stay motivated when I don\u2019t see the results I was hoping for.\n\nTomorrow I see my PA again and she will likely up my dose to 40 mg, based on what was said at my last appt. Here\u2019s to hoping I get on track soon, any words of encouragement or advice are welcomed."

I was initially prescribed me 5 mg IR to make sure I didn\u2019t have negative side effects, then was bumped up to 10 mg IR but I felt no change. I have now been prescribed 20 mg XR, however, I couldn\u2019t immediately have my prescription filled due to it being out of stock\u2026\n\nWith all this said, I decided to take 20 mg IR in the meantime - please don\u2019t shame me - which was only 2 days, but I also felt no change between the 20 mg IR and my lower doses. However, today is my first day taking 20 mg XR and I can actually feel a difference! It\u2019s not a huge difference by any means but at least I can actually feel some change/improvement. I\u2019m happy but at the same time rather confused by these results.\n\n**Anyways\u2026 to my question:**\n\n*Does anyone know why the same mg of Adderall is effective for me in extended release form vs the instant release form which has seemingly no effect?* \n\nI am trying to learn more about this medication to understand how it works and aids me, but I am having a difficult time finding information in relation to my question.

And who initially reached out to Gretchen and Elliot to try and get help from them?\n\nThat was all Skylar, doing what she could to help her family.\n\nEven more significantly, while she was *extremely* pregnant and in no shape to be working, she went and got a job to help support her family (hate Ted all you like, but her affair with him was definitely *not* her initial motivator in going back to work). She got the job because at the time she didn\u2019t know about Walt\u2019s meth money so she was doing what she could to pitch in. Again, while *about to have a baby*. No woman in her right mind should ever have to do that. Yet she did, because she was trying to provide for her family. A bookkeeper\u2019s salary might not be much, but had Walt still been teaching, her salary added to his would have likely made an impactful difference to their financial situation.\n\nAll that to say, it is unfair to Skylar to make the argument that \u201cWalt was just a good innocent man doing what\u2019s best for his family\u201d while completely disregarding her initial efforts to do so as well, specifically in seasons 1 and 2. She was doing her best to provide for the family, and initially, in a much better way than Walt was.\n\nNote: before everyone starts bitching at me about what happened seasons 3-5, chill out. I\u2019m specifically talking about her efforts at the beginning of the series to provide for her family."

After all, it doesn\u2019t make sense that the droids would be given personalities - that makes for a much less efficient army.

As i looked over the circuit board, i noticed there was a white residue around one of the smaller resistors. I am not experienced at all when it comes to electronics, but does this mean the resistor is blown, or is it indicative of something else?\n\nThe amp goes into protect mode from the getgo, but every 20 seconds or so, it quickly switches on and then back to protect mode.

What I am confused about is how exactly other devices know where to send a packet through the internet. If they send a packet to my public IP, how does my router know specifically which device to send that packet to?\n\nI imagine this scenario like the private LAN being an apartment building and their private IPs are each rooms suite #. If I mail a letter to the apartment building street address (public IP) how do they know which room to forward that letter to?\n\nI am sure I am just totally missing something basic so I would really appreciate some help!"

The fact that it still bounces around between 107-110\u00b0 is a little concerning to me, do you think this is something I should continue to look into?

Recently I\u2019ve gotten interested in building big-spell decks for Mage and I thought the Dragon package had some potential in Cobalt Spellkin, Dragoncaster, Malygos and Kalecgos so I decided to try to build a deck around big spells and dragons.\n\n\nI realized that going highlander was probably the best route for the archetype for extreme value, especially since new Alexstrasza is a card.\n\n\nSo here\u2019s what my list looks like:\n\n\n### Big Spell Reno Dragon\n# Class: Mage\n# Format: Wild\n#\n# 1x (2) Dirty Rat\n# 1x (2) Mad Scientist\n# 1x (2) Zephrys the Great\n# 1x (3) Brann Bronzebeard\n# 1x (3) Ice Block\n# 1x (3) Zola the Gorgon\n# 1x (4) Kazakus\n# 1x (4) Polymorph\n# 1x (4) Twilight Guardian\n# 1x (5) Arcane Tyrant\n# 1x (5) Barista Lynchen\n# 1x (5) Big Ol' Whelp\n# 1x (5) Cobalt Spellkin\n# 1x (5) Dragon's Fury\n# 1x (5) Malygos, Aspect of Magic\n# 1x (5) Zilliax\n# 1x (6) Blizzard\n# 1x (6) Dragoncaster\n# 1x (6) Emperor Thaurissan\n# 1x (6) Evasive Wyrm\n# 1x (6) Meteor\n# 1x (6) Reno Jackson\n# 1x (6) Reno the Relicologist\n# 1x (7) Firelands Portal\n# 1x (7) Flamestrike\n# 1x (8) Power of Creation\n# 1x (9) Alexstrasza\n# 1x (9) Dragonqueen Alexstrasza\n# 1x (9) Frost Lich Jaina\n# 1x (10) Kalecgos\n# \nAAEBAf0EHk3AAckDxQTsB/cN1hGJFMMWhRejtgLYuwLfxAKWxwKb0wLb0wLX4QLD6gKggAO9mQOgmwOKngP8owOSpAPwrwPnsAOBsQOFsQORsQPhtgMAAA==\n# \n# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone\n\n\nI have a bunch of questions that I would greatly appreciate answers to:\n\n\n1) What is the optimal number of Dragons to run, and which ones? Take into account the fact that I don\u2019t run Netherspite Historian since it tends not to discover something relevant.\n\n\n2) Are Tortollan Pilgrim & Puzzle Box of Yogg-Saron worth running? I am aware that Tortollan Pilgrim has some negative synergy with Polymorph & Meteor, while Puzzle Box is a very unreliable card. I\u2019m also considering Rolling Fireball but it\u2019s new so I\u2019m not sure about it.\n\n\n3) Is Dragoncaller Alanna a worthy craft for this deck? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too slow and doesn\u2019t present *that* much of a threat for its cost.\n\n\n4) Should I run another Secret alongside Ice Block to make Mad Scientist more consistent? My aim of running Scientist is to get Block out of my deck as soon as possible to prevent the lowroll with Dragon\u2019s Fury, so I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m comfortable pulling Ice Block and leaving Ward in my deck sometimes.\n\n\nThat is all and thanks for reading! I hope to hear your responses."

From is less sci-fi and more mystery but \n\nFor Sci fi  comedies, I think you'd like Mythic Quest (it's about a game company). Uploaded is great - for me it was like a comedy version of Severance. \n\nWestworld got worse over time but I'm yet to watch the last season. \n\nAmerican Gods, The Good Place, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Sense8 were pretty good in different ways. \n\nHaunting of the Hill House and it's 2nd season)are also very good at mystery and story telling. But no Sci-fi elements unfortunately. \n\nDirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, Preacher, Legion are in the more strange/weird category. \n\nI've watched about 10 episodes of  Mr Robot. But for some reason I don't feel like watching more eventhough I know it's pretty good.. \n\nAlice in Borderland is much better than Squid Games if you're into that. \n\nSo far my favourites had been Dark, Counterpart, 1899, American Gods. I'm a dev in profession and for some reason a good Sci-fi is really hard to come by. Please make a post if you make a list out of all the suggestions if possible. \n\n(TBH, Dark raised the bar so high that it's really hard to have low expectations and watch Sci Fi anymore)",

So this new plot is already far better, because the clone idea really is a poor retcon and overdone, just the only thing I could see work. But you're right, embracing AU will give me freedom to make a much better story, get rid of poor plotlines, yet still keep some of the themes and ideas already set out. Keep the good of both Canon and Legend, scrap the rest, and have a coherent story that hopefully appeals to the max number of Star Wars fans\n\nUnfortunately, I think you're exactly right.

Just like today, in a WWII film, the events might be all based on true stories, but what happened to possibly hundreds of people gets condensed and attributed to a handful of main characters. Maybe TCW, and potentially Rebels/other animated series, are war films that memorialized the events for the general public, while keeping the cast smaller/more famous?",

In your opinion, is it worth using any, or will it be too off-putting for AU? \n\nI genuinely appreciate just how much effort you're giving to helping a stranger make a better fic. Particularly since I know very little about the post-NJO so far.. I knew there's roughly a 100 year gap, so I thought Darth Binks might fit in there, but since you clearly know the lore it'll save me from reading all the way there only then to find out my idea won't work.

Downside is, it's not a common size spacing, so I'd have to do some measuring and find a place that carries odd sizes. \n\nWhile that's all easy enough, I got to thinking about how, since the instrument looks like a mini lute, I plan to use it for medieval-inspired music, and therefore if I were to use violin fiction pegs instead of gears, it would be a bit more simple, plus would fit the theme a little better. Before I order some, is there some reason I'm overlooking to not use them? Obviously a bit harder to use, but I also have violins so it's something I'm already used to"

It makes sense in my mind that someone collected all the propaganda from both sides and put them together (like people do with WWII irl), and just later filled in some missing details that the original propaganda writers couldn't have known (Palps being Sith, the gradual turn of Anakin, etc). The point being, of course, to try to explain the contradictions TCW has with the Legends continuity..\n\nBut I got to thinking, is there a way to make more of the propaganda reality based? Is it possible that, several times when we see a character in a situation that breaks continuity, the event could have happened, just not in that time, or with those people? \n\nFor example, one of the biggest grievances is that in Legends, Ani wasn't knighted for 2+ years later than shown in TCW.. but what if the scenes weren't always him in reality. Let's say there's a new Jedi knight, Bob, who still works closely with his old master, Jim. Few people know who Bob or Jim are, so nobody really cares when the Holonet tries to use their adventures as propaganda. Instead, because their exploits and relationship are similar to Skywalker and Kenobi, two of the biggest heros/celebrities, suddenly those names are dropped, and now everyone is watching. Or sometimes, perhaps it really was Ani and Obi, but the HoloNet reporter has been hanging onto this piece for months until just the right time to further an agenda. \n\nAre these situations actually plausible, from not just a Legends perspective, but also within TCW itself? Or does it just break everything to say that it may have been a dramatized retelling, where hundreds of nameless individuals were attributed to a handful of most famous people to increase consumption of propaganda?"

And come to find out, you *do* know what a narcissist is.. you can recognize it in your mother (who you'd just made the decision to go NC with), and you can recognize it in your wife/my mother (they're still married and have no plans otherwise, but he's taking full advantage of having a storefront in a different town, to naturally create distance until he comes home on the weekends). And I say, good for you! At least you're able to recognize those traits in others, and making necessary change for you..\n\nWell, then today. Start saying something that seems accusatory, I go on auto-defense mode because that's how I had to survive childhood. Yet suddenly you accuse *me* of being a narcissist? When I've developed the inherent tendency to always assume you're attacking me, so I default to defending myself? When I always knuckle under and let you have your way, when I almost never stand up for myself against you but in the very few times I've done so, I always let you \"win\" because I either back down, or shut up, because I'm close to breaking down and I can't take the confrontation any more? When literally the whole thing that started this today is you want me to \"shut up and listen\", but now I've literally chased you down three times to practically beg you to answer the one question I had for work\u2014which benefits you that I get a good answer btw. Then to \"prove\" your point, you start listing off narcissistic behaviors you're accusing me of\u2014some blatantly untrue, others I may be occasionally guilty of but I'm checking for every single minute of my life to try to prevent because I don't want to turn out like you; behaviors that you, however, exhibited my entire memory of childhood, still frequently exhibit today, and are literally guilty of this very moment. Is it possible that, because of you, I will/am unable to see it in myself? Yes. So thank you very much for giving me yet one more thing to lower my sense of self-worth, and one more thing for my anxiety to be terrified of. But at least I'm looking for those behaviors in myself, which you just admit you're not doing when you tell me there's no way you're a narcissist\n\nYep, finally, after 27 years, I tell you that you're a narcissist. Oh, so I obviously don't know what a narcissist is? You can't be a narcissist, because you've admitted you were wrong a few times in the past? You can't be a narcissist because you've made some improvement of your behavior over the years? Did it ever occur to you that *most* of the times you've admitted you were wrong, was to manipulate the situation so you're \"in the right\"? The very first time you EVER apologized to me was when I was 10, and you slammed my head into a post because I didn't have the ability to hold that post steady at that age.. and perhaps the only reason you apologized then was because your dad did the same when you were a kid, you'd vowed to never repeat that behavior, so now you're feeling guilty. It was close to another decade before you ever apologized to me again. And while you've since given a blanket apology for \"not being a perfect father\", since you don't admit you used to be abusive, it doesn't mean all that much.. \n\nAnd as far as becoming a better person over the years, that doesn't mean you're not narcissistic.. it just means you're slightly more self-aware. I told you a few months ago, I never felt like our relationship improved until I moved out of the house and evidently \"became a man\" in your mind, but more importantly, moved 800 miles away and went little contact. You felt it improved when we started working together when I was 14? Well sure, perhaps a bit, but when I say it wasn't significant improvement until 5 years after that, you don't get to say otherwise. And now that I moved back, largely to help both my parents, our relationship is declining again.. maybe you should listen when I tell you, right now you're demonstrating you haven't made nearly the growth you think you have. Making some improvement doesn't mean you're not a narcissist, it just means you have even less excuse to still be treating me the way you do. Trust me, no longer being physically abusive is no great feat.. get rid of the emotional abuse, and maybe you can make your case again\n\nOh and by the way dad? Look up gaslighting. I obviously don't know what a narcissist is, since I just said you're one? Hmm.."

We were just starting to get to know each other, so if there's any chance of finding her again, it would be really awesome. I don't know how much info is too much to give, so I can edit if necessary but nothing should be unreasonable.. she went under the name of Kate210, if I remember correctly she was upper 20s, she's Christian, considered herself an extroverted introvert, and probably worked in tourism. That's about all the externally identifying things I know about her.. everything else is ofc things that I can't share. \n\nI know it's a long shot, but I'm hoping someone here happened to have known her and gotten a way to contact outside the app.. or even better if she later started a new account and is back!"

I've heard a lot of people say they dislike the books after NJO, so in order to shorten the necessary time and save some money, as well as to not see the demise of a few great characters (I know the basic storyline), it seems like DNT and LotF can be easily skipped, which would also mean FotJ could be as well. So with that said: \n\n1. Are there any other books set before NJO that are generally accepted as not well liked? Not just something that's skippable because it isn't necessary for the big events, but genuinely I'm better off not reading for some reason\n2. Are there reasons to read the three series after NJO that make them worthwhile? Yes, I understand this is totally subjective, which is ok \n3. Are any of the standalone books set after NJO good? If so, are they worth reading without the later series, or are they likewise skippable if you cut out the series?"

In the Quicksilver method, Terry taught Daniel if a man can't stand, breathe, and see, a man can't fight\u2014in KK4, Mr Miyagi teaches Julie how to fight even when she can't see\n\nI know Chozen will be helping in the fight against Cobra Kai in the next season, but I think this would be a perfect opportunity to bring Julie into CK. She already has the training to directly oppose one element of Quicksilver, perhaps in the last few decades she's learned grappling to defeat the \"can't stand\" aspect, and I dunno about the can't breathe, but between the three Miyagi-Do senseis they could perhaps figure out a method for that.. maybe just a form of meditation or something\n\nAnyway, just an idea I had, would love to know what everybody else thinks!"

I looked through my email and older letters and can confirm that I had recieved no notifications or warnings about this.\n\nFine. I re-enstated my policy with no apparent increase in premium.

He hasn\u2019t been in my cousins life for what seems like forever, they have very little contact and the father is a very inconsistent person, as well as dangerous. I feel I\u2019ve somewhat overcome most struggles that a fatherless child has to deal with through years of counseling and therapy, but my aunt is old fashioned and refuses to get my cousin any sort of therapy. \n\nOver the past 2 days he has told me that he misses his dad, wants his dad back, and feels as if it is his fault that his dad rarely sees him or speaks to him. Mind you, my cousin is 5. His father is a raging-dangerous alcoholic and I often see that anger within my cousin. Yesterday, when first opening up about his father he was sad, and it was relevant to what we had been speaking about as a family. Today, not at all. We were hanging out on the bed and all of a sudden he begins hitting people and jumping angrily and forcefully while saying he missed his dad and that it\u2019s \u201cmy (his) fault that he can\u2019t see his daddy\u201d I\u2019m speaking to my aunt of this now and hoping that she will see where I\u2019m coming from.

They also tend to just spam the same move. Then never do set-up well and they never switch. Yet, when you switch your Pokemon they will cast a move which is super effective, even if it was not effective against the Pokemon you had out before or if they were spamming some other move.\n\nI've seen this happen multiple times now and it is insanely annoying and just plain unfair. Why do trainers not pick moves at the beginning of a turn like you do? This makes so many abilities in the game poinless and you get punished for switching."

So far I haven't had a lot of luck, though. I've been trying to use a save game for the PAL version of Splinter Cell.\n\nI followed the guide in the wiki on this subreddit to create a savegame file, which I transferred to my modded Xbox though FTP. I then copied it to a memory card I own to get it on the Crystal, since I don't own a usb stick which is supported by the Xbox. When I load the Linux savegame in Splinter Cell I am getting an error 21 :(\n\nDo savegame mods not work on the Crystal or am I missing something? I could do a hotswap mod again, but using a savegame is so much easier. Thanks for all the replies!\n\nEdit: I got around the problem after finding a usb stick which did work. I think my old Xbox' drive may have issues or the memory card does."

                "body": "So when I was like 6-8 I remember having two paranormal sightings:\n\nThe first one was on a normal day, probably evening. I was at my bedroom, door closed and for some reason looking at my tv (it was turned off). My room is square-shaped, my tv was on the side next to the door and my bed was on the opposite side of the room. While I was just sitting in my bed looking at my reflection on the, I saw a figure on the reflection, it was on the wall and quickly passed to behind my wardrobe.\n\nThe second one was scarier. It was midnight and I were nearly sleeping, I was just looking at my desk and then suddenly I saw a reaper or something like that, swinging a scythe in my direction. I really didn't felt anything but it scared the shit out of me.\n\nMy biggest doubt is on the first case. Is there a possibility that this \"spirit\" is still there? (It happened 8-10 years ago) . And for the more knowledgeable guys, what motivated that spirit to go behind my wardrobe? Is it hiding, or something?\n\nPlus: I've never heard any bang or weird sounds coming from the wardrobe.\nI don't know if it is a thing but recently a few cats appeared at my attic, right above my room."

I just got it yesterday from the quest at the hub, obviously, and began leveling it up and getting the new gear for it. And lemme tell you\u2014 I have been grinding for hours the past two days I've had him as a vampire. I haven't exclusively had him as a vampire for all of the gameplay, I like to level my other three jobs equally (one is 24, cat, and the other two are 25, pop star and scientist). But it was for the vast majority of the time.\n\nRight now, the vampire is at level 22 because I've been bringing him as the main mii to the galados isle with my miis (also been leveling them up equally, they're all at level 25 currently).\n\nBut he's NOT ASKING FOR GEAR! For hours he quite literally did not ask for a single piece of gear and I had to get the first three pieces from the roulette, wasting tickets because I was that frustrated. And then after that, he'd start asking but only once in a blue moon. \n\nSo right now he is a level 22 mii with the fifth outfit and the fourth weapon. Additionally with the cat job he is absolutely not asking for the new outfit that comes with literally everyone else in the inn being lvl 25, even though I played through who knows how many levels. \n\nI'm honestly getting so frustrated, because my mii only does around 20-30 dmg right now per monster due to the lack of good gear. This is honestly ruining my enjoyment of the game because if this is what it's gonna be like to make a new mii and get new gear, since I plan to get at least one leveled up character of each job (I don't have elf or tank yet) then I honestly might, idk, rage. \n\nThere needs to be some easier way for this. Maybe, idk, if a character was created post the darker lord, or one of your miis changes their job to a completely new one, maybe there should be a mechanic that they have a higher rate of asking for gear up until they reach the gear that corresponds to the next lowest member. (And subsequent leveling up of the next lowest member doesn't change that gear level threshold for that member). Thus you'd want to do things one at a time since adding another member would make the one you're currently trying to get gear for the nest lowest member. Hopefully I explained this well, it makes sense all in my head.\n\nBut yeah I'm getting really sick and tired of my mii not asking for new gear. It's been at least ten levels for my latest attempt to get him to ask. He still hasn't asked.\n\nI lose interest with things very easily and this is looking to be a very significant hurdle. \n\nIs there anything I can do to help? As in, I understand we can't increase the chances, it's completely random, but is there some underlying mechanic I don't know about? Is overleveling him basically nuking the character somehow? Do I just need to wait it out?"

She told me she was a mom and was very helpful to me when I was new and needing help. Eventually I got to the point of having a very good handle on the job after a couple months where I didn\u2019t need help much. \n\nSo the issues I\u2019ve noticed with this person is how we\u2019re both cashiers and self-checkout hosts, very simple job, but she started treating me as though I\u2019m incompetent at my job whenever I\u2019d barely walk up to assess what a customer needs. She\u2019d follow me around waiting behind while I\u2019m assisting someone and if I asked her a small question then she\u2019d just take over the entire problem like I couldn\u2019t handle it myself. It got annoying because she kept repeatedly doing that until she learned I was older than her. She snickered and said \u201coh shit\u201d and that\u2019s when she finally stopped treating me like that. Talks shit about people when their standing not too far away and acts cool in their faces. I get many compliments on my hairdo\u2019s from numerous people and she pipes up asking \u201cSo it that like a weave in your head?\u201d in a mocking way. Told me her credit score and how much she\u2019s gonna pay on the new iPhone without me asking about it at all. Lied to me when I was new about how many months it takes to go full-time (it\u2019s 3). Saying that many others including her have already applied for full-time, have seniority over me and that she\u2019s been there for 6 months so I would need to wait. So I stupidly didn\u2019t apply for full-time when I made 3 months. Fast-forward to a month later I end up getting 4 points which makes me ineligible for full-time and I was misinformed that for every point you get you have to wait 6 months for each individually to go away instead of it ALL falling off. This girl later has the nerve to ask about me going full-time and when I tell my situation she says \u201cOh yea, you\u2019ll never be able to go full-time with those kind of points\u201d and starts bragging about herself being full-time which made me raise a brow. How should I deal with this childish hater who I remind you is a mom in here early 20s?"

Most people don't seem to notice it, but I have my quirks. \n\nI'm also pretty incompetent at most things life throws at me because I'm a nervous wreck. I'm incredibly jumpy, and absolutely despise scary things and being scared. I adult very badly. \n\nMy hobbies are mostly the same as my job (or apprenticeship, rather), so that's Linux, programming, scripting, and system administration. This doesn't mean that you have to be a computer nerd yourself.\n\nI did music as a hobby once, and would like to get into that again. I haven't *made* any music, maybe a little melody once that I recorded and put on soundcloud. I can sing as well, but I don't practice it. Take it as \"I can hit the notes\". I do play multiple instruments, but my skill is mediocre in all of them. I can play the riff from Hysteria by Muse... If you give me some time to remember it.\n\nOther things I like:\n- Vidya geyms - I'm very casual, and play mostly FPS games\n- Classic board games\n    - Risk\n    - Hnefatafl\n    - Chess\n    - Partners\n    - Whatever you're willing to teach me\n- Languages (they fascinate me so)\n- Cooking (but I myself don't know how to cook)\n- Desserts! Love cake\n- Woodworking\n    - I started on the carpentry education, but dropped out as I didn't get an apprenticeship in furniture making (it's really hard to get).\n- World building\n- Constructed languages\n\nYou do not have to be interested in everything here, but you get a bonus point to be a nerd in just any field.\n\nI am aware of the restrictions currently at place, so we can stick to chatting until the lockdown ends, but I *am* willing to meet at a public place.\n\nThat was a lot of writing.

For context, Atmel Studio (or Microchip Studio) is Windows only.\n\nHere's how I want it to look, or at least something in this direction:\n```\n// Example code:\nint num[5] = {34, 789, 327, 1000, 45};\n// data IRAM should show something along the lines of this:\n// data 0x08F2  22 00 15 03 47 01 e8 03 2d 00 ...\n```\n\nThis is specifically the \"data IRAM\" on an ATMega 2560.\n\nIs there are CLion or VS Code plugin that can do this?\n\nI have no preference in IDE/editor of the two aforementioned. An individual tool is also very acceptible, as long as it can be used alongside a project.\n\nI'm running Pop!_OS 20.04, which is an Ubuntu derivative; just in case it's relevant information."

He is a capitalist for sure and I believe that he is a huge fan of things like freedom of speech and unregulated free markets, so I believe he is a right wing libertarian or at least a classical liberal \n\nJotaro: He starts of as an example of a young rebellious teen and he is quite definitely some kind of left leaning libertarian. During the parts after Part 3 I believe he is more centre leaning and even apolitical. I think he would vote for some kind of green/ecologist party and that he wouldn't be really political.\n\nJosuke: Not really into politics but I think he would support some kind of social democracy.\n\nGiorno: Yeah, he is a communist\n\nJolyne: Also libertarian socialist like young Jotaro but even more focused on the \"socialist\" part\n\nJohnny: I have red very few of steel ball run but as far as I know he is probably an egoist. (Yes this is an actual political ideology) and he is for sure an individualist\n\nPart 9 Josuke: As I said I have red just a bit from SBR and I haven't gotten into Jojolion yet."

I have seen so many beautiful textbook before and afters pictures in this sub prior to my reduction, and I'm so very happy for those posters. I personally struggled with my recovery (2.5mpo)physically and mentally. If you're in the same boat, I see you.  \nI felt overwhelmed by post-op pain, and discouraged by how long it took me to physically better, especially when it seemed other posters bounced back so quickly. Maybe it's my age, perimenopause is a beast of its own to deal with. I was disappointed with my results, and was convinced that I had made a terrible decision. That was very early on, maybe 2wpo. You might feel that way too, and that's totally normal and valid. \n\nDays after being cleared for physical activity during my 1mpo appointment, both my vertical incisions became infected. That was over a month ago, and it's probably going to be another two weeks until I'm fully healed from the infection. *However*, now that I've lost the bruising, softened up, and dropped a little,  and the infections are almost fully healed, I'm feeling better about things. I've finally been cleared to begin low impact exercise, and hopefully I'll feel even better once I get back into that routine.\n\nBig love and support to all the followers of this sub feeling post-op blues, I hope that by sharing my experience will help some of you feel not so alone."

I want to always learn new things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiscipline\n\nDiet, fitness, successful career - all require good discipline. I try to be as disciplined as I can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappiness\n\nI want to be happy with my life not just live the grind. I am looking for love, dating, having fun with my friends. There is no point of working hard if I can't be happy myself."

Perhaps this wasn't just a creative decision and the reason they gave was bullcrap, but just to make him look like Tom Holland is the best explanation we're going with? How about an issue with the original model's contract? If you were the original face of Spider-Man in this game, wouldn't you be upset at being replaced? I know I would, I'd be as outraged as everyone seems to be about this change. Two days ago, John Bubniak tweeted, \"\ud83d\udd77\u2764 forever,\" that's it. Whatever happened to his contract, this was a necessary change, that probably had less to do with bone structure and the MCU, and everything to do with the face model contract agreement. \n\nPersonally, when I first saw this new face, I was in love.

I suggested that she talk to another relative about it, but she's not really close to anyone else in her family. I also gave her my antidepressants (Lexapro/Prozac) to help with her depression.
