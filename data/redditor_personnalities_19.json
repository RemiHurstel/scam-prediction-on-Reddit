Seemed like a simple stalker plot at first but oh boy it is so much more than that)\n\nYour throne, Unordinary, TOG, TBATE and Omniscent reader (i mean they are just popular all time favs I will always love because of the amazingly written characters and a page turning (or maybe scrolling) plot)\n\nyour throne starts off as a typical \"I wish i had your life\" story and the innocent girl who took the place for the girl who trainned a long time to become queen and they switch bodies with eachother and eventually work together to fight against the prince who is the real villain, the mc is super calculative\n\nKillstagram, Bastard, Disconnected from reality Sweet home (also pretty good thriller, you will love the first three if you liked it's mine)\n\nSSS class Suicide Hunter\n\nThe lone necromancer\n\nRegressor Instruction Manual (one of my faves in the regressor genre and the MC himself isn't the regressor but controls one that is, you will like it if you liked fff class trash hero)\n\nDeath's game\n\nStudy group, Viral hit, Weak hero (kids fighting)\n\nThe devil's boy\n\nDICE (ppl play life as a game with dices)\n\nVillains are destined to die (isekai into an otome game go brr)\n\nReason why realina ended up at the duke's mansion, Where Tangents meet, Something about us, gatabutata, winter woods, makeup remover (other cute romances)\n\nThrow the trash in the trash cane (romance of trash like humans, sounds shitty but the story sucks you in pretty quick)\n\nPurple Hyacinth\n\nThe Boxer\n\nHellper\n\nEleceed (cats and vamps, what else do you want)\n\nThe ember knight- really smart mc. it is like a revenge story where there are these twins and one of them are is about the become a knight but is killed, so the weak twin brother takes his place pretending that he is strong in hope to get revenge for his brother\n\n\"The Fabled Warrior\" is pretty good its about a hero who came back from being isekaied and she grew up and became a mother and stuff but then the people from the other world try to get her help again except she has responsibilities now and doesnt want to help them\n\nThis is my manhwa/ webtoon fav list (tho it misses some entries) and looks like your list has a lot common with mine, so wanted to share the entire list.

                "body": "In the LN, there were 12 zodiac groups instead of 8 planets. Anime made the change probably because of the class size.\n\nAnyways, there's a 3 step logic pattern being selecting the VIP.\n\nStep 1: the number of the zodiac group.\n\nStep 2: the japanese character alphabetic order of the last names of people in the group.\n\nStep 3: The VIP is the person whose position is the number of the zodiac group in that alphabetical order.\n\neg: **Rabbit (Mars)** group is the 4th zodiac group. Japanese Alphabetical order: Ayanokoji,  Ichinose, Ibuki, Karuizawai... So the 4th person in the alphabetic order  is the VIP i.e. Karuizawa Kei.\n\nSame from **Dragon** group, Dragon is the 5th zodiac and Kushida is the 5th person in the alphabtical order.\n\nRyuen figured out this logic as he had the names of all 3 VIPs of his class and the VIP of his own group (Kushida). Using this, Class C guessed correctly- **Rat** group (VIP from class A), **Horse** group (VIP from D), **Rooster** (VIP from A), **Pig** (VIP from A).\n\nI think Ichinose also figured the logic so that's probably why she asked the B students in the Cow group to give wrong names if asked to introduce themselves? or maybe even without Ichinose's orders, the class C students just didn't introduce themselves or talk at all? probably the latter because Ichinose didn't figure out Kei being the VIP until the last meeting when she saw Kei staring at Ayano.\n\nMaybe that's why C tried to guess the **Cow** group but guessed wrong.\n\nAnd the VIP of **Dog** group (also VIP from B) was never guessed. Similarly, **Tiger, Sheep, Snake** (VIPs from C)  reached outcome 2 (VIP never guessed).\n\nAnd then there is the **Monkey** group where Koenji guessed the correct VIP (from class B) from the start.\n\nSummary:\n\n* Outcome #1 (The group answered correctly): Dragon.\n* Outcome #2 (The VIP was not identified): Tiger, Snake, Sheep, Dog.\n* Outcome #3 (The traitor answered correctly): Rat, Horse, Monkey, Rooster, Pig.\n* Outcome #4 (The traitor answered incorrectly): Cow, Rabbit.\n\nAlso if you ask why didn't Ryuen get the class C students to guess the Rabbit, Cow and Dog groups? Ryuen just made some sort of deal with other classes' students, which is a hidden plot in vol 4-7:-\n\nThere was a scene that implied that  Kanazaki had made deal with Ryuuen behind Ichinose's back behind the  scenes. Kanzaki gave the names of the Class B VIP and in return, Ryuuen  helps Class B not get a negative result after Koenji made them lose 50  points\n\nRyuuen likely ordered his classmate from Cow group to guess wrong, giving Class B the extra 50  points leaving them at 0. No loss or win for class B and making the deal  fair\n\nThe other 2 groups had Class B students in them and Kanzaki didn't want to further drag Class B into  his deal with Ryuuen hence why Ryuuen didn't do anything. Had he done something, Kanzaki would've likely betrayed his group and given Kushida's name to the school, resulting in Ryuuen losing Kushida's trust.\n\nAnd for the rabbit group which had Ichinose and Kiyo: Kanzaki wanted the deal to involve him and him alone since Ichinose didn\u2019t want to work with Ryuuen because she thought of him as  untrustworthy.

Is it just because people didn't introduce themselves or just not talk? that can't be it, right? I mean he did guess 4/7 (leaving the dragon (because >!prolly sth with kushida!<), the 3 groups with class C VIPs, the one Koenji guessed)\n\nWhy did he not guess the VIPs of Cow, Rabbit and Dog groups?"

The speaker handled it really well and gave grace to the hypothetical person as well as the audience member who asked the question, saying that we dont really know the best thing to do and that the topic would benefit from non-reactionary dicussion.\n\nA last audience member (hardcore BLMer) asked about cancel culture, and how it can be really counter-productive and doesnt allow for people to have genuine changes of character (people are being penalized for what they said years ago), and there was a great dialogue there too.\n\nThe radical left presents a real danger to the world, just as the radical right does, but it was so comforting and hopeful that there are still people on the left who are advocates for nuanced discussion and good-faith conversation, who realize these issues are complicated and want to work together with those of opposing viewpoints.\n\nJust a reminder that they're out there, and they're worth trying to find"

I saw all threat and no promise. We\u2019re held by the rules of the games we choose to play, as you have said, and I was playing Lampwick\u2019s game, and the game of the one he was named after.\n\nBut now I\u2019m beginning to learn the language of God\u2019s game, and I think you\u2019re one of the things that is setting me free. God\u2019s game is sacrifice and adventure, suffering and moments where the great patterns break through the seemingly ordinary and take me by surprise.\n\nI\u2019m starting my own business, I\u2019m treating my profession teaching physics with respect and trying to be conscious and intentional about how I treat the teenages that have been situated in my sphere of influence. I\u2019m writing a novel and I\u2019m starting to listen to music as opposed to just hearing it. I\u2019m more curious now. Less afraid, or perhaps the things I fear have changed. I fear now the kind of person that perfectionism and despair and timidity will turn me into. \n\nI\u2019m a woman, and I know your message is oriented around men, but I think you\u2019re helping me cultivate my *animus* (I hope I\u2019m using that idea correctly). Your purpose and message is for development of men, certainly, but it\u2019s also for the development of the masculine spirit. So I confront my dragons now. \n\nYou\u2019ve got the Logos, and you\u2019re showing me that I have it too. Thanks for walking with God such that He would trust you to impact this many lives.\n\nIf you have any projects you need extra manpower on, please have your team message me. "

(Sam Harris' wording would be \"well-being\")\n\nAtheist: Because we would all agree that thriving is better than not thriving.\n\nT: But why is it better?\n\nA: Because we\u2019ve been programmed to think its better. We come from an evolutionary history of believing it\u2019s better, with pain systems to reinforce that.\n\nT: I\u2019d agree with that. But I\u2019d also say that the programming might be a reflection of a higher truth that it is better. And it\u2019s also interesting because it appears that you\u2019re saying (correct me if I\u2019m wrong), that it\u2019s not actually better, we just think/believe/are under the impression that it\u2019s better. The issue with that is that you open that up to the possibility that what you believe is an illusion. If you\u2019re saying that evolution gave rise to our value structure (which I would actually agree with), and that evolution completely describes the significance of the value structure (which I would not agree with), you could then say that \u201cbelieving thriving is better than not thriving\u201d is a product of cognitive structures that were programmed a certain way. So by saying that, you may run the risk of someone saying \u201cMy evolution is *telling me* that thriving is better, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that thriving *is* better. What my biology is telling me is not necessarily a reflection of a higher truth that it is better. And if it\u2019s not true, there\u2019s no real grounding to hold that belief.\u201d\n\nA: But there is grounding to hold that belief: we can all agree that thriving is better because all of us (with a few dismissable exceptions) can agree that having your head stay on your body is better than having it cut off. There are certain things that (almost) all of us can agree on. We could consider those things to be \u201ctrue\u201d.\n\nT: I think you can make a good case that those things *appear* to be valuable (thriving appears to be good). The problem with the argument is that you can\u2019t make an axiomatic claim that those things *are* good by using any of the following ideas: \u201cWe all agree they\u2019re good\u201d, \u201cWe come from a long line of creatures that were programmed to think they\u2019re good\u201d. Neither of those ideas would satisfy us in a line of rigorous thought.\n\nA: But I\u2019m just trying to lay the claim that you can form a secular morality that *works* without basing anything in ideas that can\u2019t be proven (God).\n\nT: But you can\u2019t really prove that thriving is good. So you\u2019re already running into ideas that can\u2019t be proven. So you\u2019re taking a leap of faith there.\n\nA: It\u2019s not a leap of faith. We can all agree that having your head removed is antithetical to your own well-being, and that (almost) all of us want well-being.\n\nT: But, again, why do we all agree?\n\nA: I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a relevant question. We don\u2019t really need to know why something happens in order to form a system that works. For example, we don\u2019t really need to know why the atoms of a chair stick together in order to build ourselves a functional chair.\n\nT: But an issue you run into is that you don\u2019t really have a basis as to why thriving is good, you can\u2019t hold your belief that \u201cthriving is good\u201d over the heads of people who believe that thriving is not good. \n\nA: But if that\u2019s what most people think, we *can* do that. We hold beliefs over people\u2019s heads all the time, in terms of how the penal system works. Using our beliefs that murder is wrong, we punish people who hold different beliefs (that murder is not wrong).\n\nT: Good, so you can in practicality, I totally agree with that. But you can\u2019t in principle. You can\u2019t make a logical argument that life is better than death. There\u2019s no underlying reason why your view is more correct than the view of a school shooter (death is better than life). Your underlying reasons are that you have a subjective impression, and that a majority of other people have that subjective impression. But that\u2019s not a proof. And if you don\u2019t have a proof, you can\u2019t ever definitively say that life is better than death. \n\nA: Okay, but I don\u2019t need to do that in order to have a system that works. \n\nT: Maybe, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s self-evident either. Like it appears to me that another issue you run into with secular morality is that the secular morality systems that work best actually end up converging on the idea of God. Here\u2019s my argument for this: we have this phenomenon that moral systems that are not oriented around the highest possible ideal tend to not be sustainable. In other words, when your goal is just \u201crespect\u201d, \u201csuccess\u201d, \u201chappiness\u201d, or  \u201cequality\u201d, for example, the methods you employ to reach that goal will degrade over time. What appears to work the best in terms of goals is when you aim at the highest ideal: which is a combination/balance/harmony of the highest goods. But then a combination/balance/harmony of the highest ideal is actually just God anyway. Like that\u2019s a good working conception (and perhaps even a definition) of God lol\n\nA: You don\u2019t have empirical proof of your claim \u201cmoral systems that are not oriented around the highest possible ideal tend to degrade over time\u201d\n\nT: That\u2019s true. Maybe the issues of the 20th century? But there are logical ways around this probably"

By narratives I mean the perspectives through which we view the world - the set of beliefs we hold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we are exposed to only truth, we would embody and absorb the truths into our systems of beliefs. As a result, the narratives  that form our perceptual structures and actually map objective reality onto our subjective experience, the narratives we couple to via speech, would be accurate and true. True narratives are powerful narratives. And about the most advantageous thing that you can have in life is a set of powerful narratives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople who hold powerful narratives (as contrasted with people who are slaves to weak narratives, where the narratives hold them, as JP describes ideologues) are the kind of people who are equipped to actually make the world a better place.  They know how to pilot their body, their emotions, they know their inner world. They're able to persist through tragedy and hardship, and they're strong enough to take on additional suffering in the pursuit of Good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of this is not to say we should silence the chattering to make this thought experiment into a reality (which would be problematic in the free speech department). It does, however, paint a picture of the living power of the Logos, to be able to transform a society of individuals so profoundly just by using speech in this way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, and so let\u2019s take this a step further and say that the individuals in Group A are diverse and developed enough to be able to provide multiple different facets of truth (which would be likely because it takes lots of depth and growth to be able to see/comprehend the truth before you speak it anyway). We then have a collection of individual truths that we can compile; and then we can abstract out into universal human truths. To put this in metaphor: If you think of truth as the light, biology as the prism, and the projection of colors as the collection of individuals, we can \u201ctriangulate\u201d the projections of truth on these individuals and track the projection back to its source (the light). This process of abstracting out the essential truth, if it is actually acted out in the person's mind (sidenote: also it's interesting that \u2018act\u2019 is the first three letters in \u2018actually\u2019), can help the individual realize truth, internalize it, and apply it to their life. And the echoes of that will manifest across multiple theatres (the brain of the individual, the rest of the body, the brains of other individuals when that truth is passed onto them by speech, epigenetics, bodies of art, society, politics, evolution, etc.).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe power of truth is immense, apparently."

Whenever I hear of people\u2019s successful suicides, I feel envious. And I learned than envy, when handled maturely, can be the compass that points to your desires. Whenever I\u2019m not planning my death, I\u2019m actively avoiding the inclination. I\u2019m on the verge. It\u2019s tiring. Wanting to die is the only stable thing in my life. It\u2019s been with me ever since I was 8 years old. Every time I am \u201csaved\u201d, it\u2019s only a brief matter of time before I\u2019m at it again. I\u2019m either a burden to others, or a burden to myself, and it\u2019s exhausting. Even if there were a solution, i.e. therapy, I\u2019m not worth the price, and neither am I worth the time. I\u2019ve been on medication for some months now, but its effect is starting to diminish. I chose to go with pills as a solution because it\u2019s the cheaper alternative. But you know what\u2019s the cheapest option of all? The one where I die.\n\nEdit: I rethought my decision after I was able to achieve mental clarity. I realized that the promise of death protects me from my ultimate fear: the future, and all that falls under that. After figuring out my problem, the next step was coming up with less dysfunctional and conclusive solutions. For now, I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to learn to be emotionally self-sufficient, because I\u2019m not ready to deal with my fear of abandonment or my fear of rejection just yet. In a way, it\u2019s a less extreme form of death: social isolation. When I sternly tell myself that the support of others is no longer something I can seek out anymore, the stress of lacking it is very much alleviated. While I\u2019m here, I want to focus on music, both discovering it and creating it. I want to learn and teach. I want to start making new dishes. So right now, I am concerned with the 3 I\u2019s of isolation: instruments, information, and ingredients. (Sorry, I love alliterations. As soon as I saw that opportunity, I had to take it). Point is, I\u2019m putting off suicide for now. I\u2019ll save it for a worse day."

I can understand the song list portion of the argument, but...I\u2019m a weird person that prefers the song list the way it is. An exception is Ievan Polkka though I don\u2019t understand why Sega didn\u2019t add this, and After Burner, but Sega conveniently added the songs I enjoyed on Future Tone to Mega 39\u2019s. And I know Mega 39\u2019s has fewer songs, but with the new game mode, and the fact that I can play the game ANYWHERE and ANYTIME gets me so excited! I think people spend too much time thinking about the negatives of this game and try to see the positive of it, even if they\u2019re not planning to buy the game. I get it that people have different opinions, but it really brings me down to see everybody saying the same things and saying that Mega 39\u2019s is awful when they haven\u2019t even played it yet."

I assumed being a Membrum and slowly dying was what caused this pain, but at this instance he still suffers from his illness. Also, Anastasia said something along the lines of \"the swift motion with which he took his medicine showed how long he had been dealing with this\" so could it be that this pain was actually from his illness?"

I've tried to get her used to grooming but she absolutely hates it, no matter what I do. I tried 4 different types of brushes (comb, slicker, bristle, and furminator) to see if she would at least warm up to one of them, and I even tried to bribe her with treats but nothing is working. She needs to be regularly groomed because otherwise she gets knots and feces tangled in her fur. Is it okay to trim her fur? Any tips on how I can get her used to being groomed?"

Turns out the fan was installed so that it is sucking air in through the top vent and pushing hot air out the coiled sides. This is the exact opposite to how it was originally running. My \"Auto\" setting is a joke because it took almost two days to reach the desired temp (typically only 4hrs)... I don't want to confront this guy as I think his company may have him installing this way on purpose to shorten the lifespan of devices.\n\n**How do I reverse the direction of an aftermarket fan motor?

I am on the hunt for a 0 atk, 15 def, 15 hp Eevee that is level 27.5 (or under) for a great league Umbreon. I am wondering if a chart exists where I could input those specific IVs and receive a list from 1 to 40 of all the CPs at each of the levels at 0/15/15 so I have an idea of what CPs I should be on the lookout for in the wild. \n\nNow that I've typed this out, I realize it will be near impossible to memorize all the CPs from level 1 to 27.5 in order to know what to look for, so I'll likely just catch every Eevee and check their IVs. Although I am still curious if such a chart exists. I would even settle for a formula in which I could input level and IVs and do the math myself to calculate CP at any given level.\n\nI appreciate any response. I was a hardcore level 40 player for a few years, but I've been in a slump the last few months due to working excessive hours so I'm a bit out of the loop and any help is appreciated as I try to re-enter the Pokemon GO universe.\n\nTL:DR - I have a known set of IVs for a specific Pokemon Species. I want to know the CP at each level. Chart or formula? Thanks."

I study it in my uni and my vocab is mostly a technical one and too formal. It's hard selecting what tone to write in (formal? Too formal? Informal?) Maybe when I have the time I can pick up some books to read. Otherwise I don't have the same cringe reaction as I have when trying to produce content in Arabic.\n\n\nFor Arabic I am slightly disconnected from the language. Didn't come in contact with it in 3 years besides reading Quran. \nIt is more nuanced than English (and tougher. Grammar is still confusing the hell out of me even as a native). I want to try to write in it someday to be honest. If I could get over my cringe reaction since somehow words come easier when I am using it.\n\nThere is also the fact I am writing in English to improve my skills in it for the sake of any future uni research and stuff. (Funny country seeing you study everything in Arabic till Hs, study in French in uni and then you have to switch to Eng for research since there are not enough sources lol).\n\nThough in English some concepts come in easier (Loads of forums and resources regarding writing are available). Overconsumption of English content may have normalized it for me as the language to write fanfic and stuff in.\n\nMaybe if I finish my current fic I will try and translate it to those two languages.",

Is not that I don't like them per se, is the fact that they require a lot of work. I also want to travel a lot and having to think about it, is something I don't want to deal with. Also having to take the pet out to play, walk, whatever on a daily basis is something I don't see myself doing. \n\n-if you don't make me laugh/treat me like a queen etc. I am looking for someone to spend my life with, I am not planning to be an entertainer for whatever entitled brat. And no, I'm not a boring person, I enjoy humour and always keep a light hearted atmosphere. I can break tensions by cracking a joke, or make your day better. \n\n-if you don't have a strong pick up line. I don't see myself playing that game. I am capable of having meaningful conversations on so many subjects which can reveal personality and way of thinking, not gonna limit myself to a shitty pick up line.\n\n-botox and stuff like that. That rings as insecurity for me. I prefer natural women: freckles, stretch marks, wrinkles - I find them way more appealing, than somebody trying to be perfect. All those are so awesome,they have a story behind them and that makes you unique!\n\n-strong supporter of feminism. If this behaviour is healthy, I have nothing against it, but most of the times I found that those people misunderstand that term and have a toxic behaviour against men. I repeat, if is healthy I have nothing against it. I am all in for equal pay, and chances for women in society, against misogyny and so on -  but when I see their bio like strong supporter of feminism, I take it with a pinch of salt.\n\n-profile full with pictures with lots of people's and parties, drinks etc. I am an introvert and I want a partner who is similar. I am not into raves and partying as a lifestyle. I can go every now and then to concerts with lots of people and so on, but not on a daily basis. I don't want to be perceived as a hermit living in a crib, I just have a small social battery. I am not sitting in my house 24/7 either.

Then buy a bungalow for \u00a3400k in the country side, renovate it for my own taste, and buy a car like an Audi S3 sportback. Although irrelevant, I would just pay student loan in full so I'll never see those deductions on my payslips as the feeling of debt ( although is not a real debt but a tax ) triggers me. Then, I would book a holiday for me and my mum to travel a bit as we never did. Keep a low profile and continue working, maybe less shifts but still at least 30hours a week to keep myself active and my mind sane. \n\nProbably I would travel more in Asia and Americas when I get free time from work. Additionally, I would donate some money to different causes constantly. Also I would help my family to get better, but in a way to not make them suspicious. \n\nSo in the end those money would offer me more comfort, and a slightly different lifestyle as I would already own a house, a car, and no debts. The luxury of not having the stress of tomorrow and the possibility to work less, focus more on hobbies as crafting, learning to play musical instruments, and traveling abroad more often, sounds really appealing, but the reality has something else in store for me as it stands...but maybe someday things will change. To be honest owning a house without having to pay a mortgage at a young age is already a luxury for me. \n\nSo, now that I'm thinking about it, I would live a happy life with way less.

It makes me want to cry, it makes me want to scream.\n\nWhen I express to christians that god should be doing more if he's really as good as he supposed to be, I get treated like I'm childish and I just want a big sky daddy to fix my life for me.

But it is finally time, the deadline sits in front of my eyes as I enter my state of hibernation, \"2023\" it says, till' 2023 I shall wait then. I snuggle under the Pikmin fort, composed of egregious amounts of Pikmin merchandise, I hug my Louie body pillow and close my eyes one last time. I will dream to pass the time, I will envision the new gameplay features, the new enemies, the new Pikmin. They will be waiting for me, just as I am waiting for them, we will see eachother again in 2023.\n\nNow that I think about it, the specific date hasn't been announced yet, it could be any day of 2023! I could wake up from the hibernation and find myself still waiting for months, or I could wake up to a world that has already seen and experienced the approaching masterpiece, it's expertly written story could be spoiled in few sentences, ruining my experience permanently. It might even get delayed and redone from the start! No, that's impossible, I will know when the time is right, I will feel it in my guts, my unproportionally huge guts. I had to eat a lot in order to go into the hibernation state, ok? Don't look at me like that. I will hear Steve's voice calling my name, then I will wake up, and my Switch will be locked in my titanium safe alongside my Wii, my Gamecube, my 3ds and every Pikmin game in existence. That will be an inconvenience, but I will have the strength, enough strength to lift the plushies and figurines of this blessed pile and break open the safe's door.

She's also only 11 and children this age are like this. If she sees this online about her, we don't know how she'll respond to this, children handle these very differently and it can result in her lack of confidence or just overall feeling bad. Maybe she'd actually act spoiled.\n\nMy point is, we should refrain from it and spare a child from the internet. Especially since she's already hyped up as the \"prettiest\", she could fast some nasty thoughts and comments, and it would take a toll on her once she no longer is the golden child. \n\nShe's still a child and has absolutely no idea what she's in for."

If I checked in early that was wrong, if I checked in 2 or 3 minutes after that was also wrong. Everyone would always have to wait in a line right next to the computer to clock in. Sooo stupid and annoying. My manager sucked but I get that the corporate managers were at least partially the problem because they were yelling at her about me repeatedly clocking in \u201clate\u201d. Then I clocked in a minute or two early and she was also yelled at. She then explained it had to be exactly on the hour. \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude24 Such a stupid policy considering everyone was also trying to use the bathroom at the same time to put on pantyhose and the dress they had us all wear. I sometimes would put the outfit on early but pantyhose aren\u2019t the most comfortable and if it was wet out they would often get stained by mud when walking and in Seattle in the winter it is often wet out. So what would end up happening was you would have to arrive to work at least 30 minutes early to make certain that you were dressed early enough to clock in or you would have to do what I sometimes did which was wait around to clock in and then get dressed instead of immediately start working on the hour. Although when my manager caught on that I was clocking in then getting dressed sometimes she yelled at me for not immediately starting work after clocking in. I still did it anyway because if I\u2019m having to get there 30 early and not getting paid that\u2019s not right.",

Germany the largest purely European country has like 83 or 84 million people. But the smallest European countries have populations around 30,000 people. Our states have populations between 40 million and 550,000.\n\nAs I said elsewhere it is understandable to not know Alaska well since it is so far away from Europe. I suspect most Europeans are a bit more familiar with our states that have the largest populations and are closer to them. Just like Americans are more familiar with the European countries that are closer to the US and have larger populations. There are plenty of Americans who know very little about Alaska although if you live in the US continental region of the Pacific Northwest you are more likely to know about Alaska.

                "body": "(If you are reading this, be prepared. It is a whole 3.5k words)\n\nIt all started with a normal day at my house. I was on my phone tapping away when suddenly I saw a small glint of orange on the floor. It seemed very unordinary so I stared at it a bit, until out of the blue, it catches fire. I start screaming, \u201cMom! Dad! There\u2019s a fire!!\u201d They come in and my dad runs outside to get a hose and starts spraying that area on the floor like crazy until he manages to get it out. We all sigh in relief but then another fire ignites by itself in front of us, and then another, and another till our entire house is on fire. My mother calls 911 as everyone else is trying to extinguish the fire. Once fire fighters come, they barge into the house and start hosing it down and I grab a hose from the firetruck to help as well because I realize that the fire looks to be very difficult for them to calm down. Eventually we do get rid of all of the fire, but our house looks horrible. It\u2019s turned all black and has crumbled into wet pieces. The captain of the firefighters were talking to my dad and I catch a bit of their conversation and he says, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a fire this bad. It seemed like we had to hose down every centimeter of your house before it went out, we used way too much water than we usually do. I suggest you guys find a place to refuge for the next week because this place is practically unlivable now.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s what we do, we go to a store, buy what we can and refuge in a small motel. While we\u2019re there, I meet a girl named Loona. She seemed to be in her late teens like me and she was an expecting mother. I didn\u2019t see anyone around who could possibly be the father but she seemed happy so I congratulated her though a bit worried about her being a single mother in addition to being a teenage mother. I ask her about what she wants to call her baby and she says she doesn\u2019t know yet. We talk for a bit before I decided to check out the room my entire family will be sleeping in.\n\nIt was small and definitely cramped but hell, we were too shaken up by the fire to complain. \n\nSo as I\u2019m laying on the floor, suddenly I hear my brother yell, \u201cHey! The bathroom\u2019s on fire!\u201d And again my entire family panics and starts trying to extinguish the fire. My dad and brother are trying to calm it down and my mother is calling 911 again. And while they\u2019re doing that, I notice a really bright light is coming out from behind our front door, so I open it. And the view is just horrific.\n\nEvery motel room we were connected to was in flames, and there were tons more fires starting around the city as pockets of smoke were rising from different places in the distance. So I start yelling, \u201cGuys forget about the bathroom! The entire motel is on fire let\u2019s get out!\u201d And so they stop and run out the door with me. \n\nPeople are freaking out, some haven\u2019t even been able to get out yet and those that are outside are too scared to run back into the fire to help the ones still inside. The firefighters are able to make it to us quickly and starts extinguishing it again. \n\nBefore they even finish, buses pull up the area, and one of the bus drivers yell, \u201cGuys! The fires happening are too dangerous, they seem to be driving our entire city to the ground! We\u2019re going to drive out as far as we can and seek shelter in other towns until it dies down.\u201d\n\nEveryone starts trying to pile in the buses and I am trying to follow along with my family but I get pushed back and I lose sight of them. So I curse to myself and get on the first bus I see. I\u2019m going down the aisle and trying to see if my family are in there until suddenly I notice someone. Loona.\n\nShe was sitting towards the back of the bus alone, looking out the window. I decide to sit beside her because she\u2019s the only person I recognize.\n\nLoona gasps and talks about how scary this all is and so I ask her if she and her baby is okay and she says yes. She asks the same to me and I say no. \u201cI\u2019m worried. I lost sight of my parents, but hopefully they\u2019re all together. There\u2019s my brother, parents, two baby sisters, and my grandparents. I hope they\u2019re okay considering my grandparents are really weak and my sisters are still young.\u201d And she lets me ramble for a bit because she knows I\u2019m panicking.\n\nAnd after I cool down, she smiles, and I asked her what\u2019s up. Loona then shakes her head and looks down at her stomach and says, \u201cYou really seem to care about your family. I hope that when my baby grows up, he grows up to be just like you.\u201d I didn\u2019t really know how to process that but I was flattered, so I thanked her. The rest of the ride, we talk about her baby and about what she plans to do when all these fires calm down. Loona seemed like a really amazing and mature mother despite only being in her teens.\n\nMore than anything she said this, maybe jokingly I\u2019m not really sure, \u201cI know it\u2019s scary right now, but hey, while we\u2019re together, I\u2019ll be your stand-in-mom until you actually find her.\u201d and she really did feel like a mom. She held my hand until we made it to our final destination, and she was dead set on making sure we were together and choosing where we were going to go.\n\nLoona said she was tired of sleeping in motels so we went over to the houses. She knocks on the door, and somehow, with her negotiation skills she was able to convince them to let us in. But there was only one issue. They said that they were a big family and could really only let one person in, but they\u2019d ask their next door neighbor to see if they could squish another person into their house.\n\nLoona and I were skeptical. We didn\u2019t want to split up at a time like this, but decided to work with what we had. The owner comes back and tells me that the neighbor is willing to take someone in. \n\nDeciding that I would go to the neighbor\u2019s house, I hug Loona as tight as I can and we tell each other to stay safe. Making my way over to the other house, I instantly regret it once I get in. I\u2019ve never seen so many knives and guns hung up on walls before and my god are the people living there were just as sketchy. \n\nI somehow maneuver my way past them and hide in a corner and say I\u2019d be fine sitting here the whole time as to not be a disturbance.\n\nAt some point I had gotten Loona\u2019s phone number, so I pull out my phone and text her. \u201cLoona I don\u2019t trust these people. Can you please convince your guys to let me in? \u201d And I take a quick picture of their house and send it to her. She answers back. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best. I know it may feel scary to be alone, but I\u2019m just a phone call away if things get too tough. Call me and we\u2019ll get out of here as soon as we can.\u201d And so we leave it at that.\n\nI fall asleep, and the next day, I wake up to someone making a lot of noise. It sounds like someone fiercely hacking away at a cutting board. And so I turn the corner and see the father of the house with his back turned to me, slamming down a meat cleaver against his kitchen counter. The floor creaks where I step and he looks back. Immediately I bolt out the door with my things."

The issue is, it nearly breaks my heart to erase all of that hard work. So instead, I copy all the things I need to take out of the chapter and paste it onto a separate document. And I kept doing this and building up this doc of deleted writing and chapters, that for a single story I have thousands of words purely of deleted scenes and sometimes I wonder if I have a hoarding problem. Because I know all of that writing goes no where and has no relevance, but I can\u2019t imagine deleting any of my work no matter how small it is."

That's why back when Gouri asked everyone to announce who they shared their passwords with, everyone was silent. This probably means that Yuuichi (and therefore the mastermind) knows everyones passwords apart from his old friends. And judging by Yuuichis ability to understand humans, he probably has already guessed his friends passwords just from previous experiences with them.\n\nTalking about mastermind, it's probably Hokuto, she's related to Ryuusei who was stated cleared Adult Tomodachi Game twice. There's no way her brother is that talented and she isn't, the very fact she's gotten to the final game means she's no joke either."

It also fits into Fearless, but on every listen it's so reminiscent of the Speak Now song, and I can just about imagine her short curly hair and red lips whenever I listen to it.   \nThe ending also sounds like other Joe Jonas breakups like Last Kiss and Haunted. She uses a line from the first verse, then changes it a bit. The only difference is that she doesn't cut out the last word. But if she did leave it out and says, \"You said you'd never go...\" and leaves it hanging, it would be true to the theme of Joe Jonas Speak Now songs.  \n\n\nThus, there's her more mature voice, which resembles the Speak Now era more than it does the Fearless era - especially the Live versions where her voice which has a slightly less bright tone than the originals.  \n\n\nThen there's the way she sings it. The way she prolongs \"face\", \"stay\", \"away\", etc, is similar to how she prolongs \"I\", \"girl\", \"boy\", \"friends\", etc in Speak Now (song). Thus, I keep imagining Mr Perfectly Fine but with the chords of Speak Now and it feels like it just fits.  \n\n\nHonestly, the only thing missing are the loud electric guitars from the Speak Now era and it would totally fit in."

Nunca fui f\u00e3 de estudar porque prefiro saber sobre coisas do meu interesse, e uma mat\u00e9ria que sempre me cativou foi filosofia. Antes eu tamb\u00e9m gostava de algumas coisas em ci\u00eancias, mas essa mat\u00e9ria simplesmente se dividiu em tr\u00eas, em que duas  delas s\u00e3o um inferno: Qu\u00edmica, F\u00edsica e Biologia.\n\nNunca havia dado trabalho para minha m\u00e3e em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos estudos. Conseguia passar tranquilamente nas mat\u00e9rias ao simplesmente estudar para a prova na v\u00e9spera, e na hora H conseguia me lembrar o suficiente pra passar e \u00e0s vezes at\u00e9 tirar notas como 8. S\u00f3 matem\u00e1tica que eu acho que foi ficando cada vez pior, ent\u00e3o precisava da ajuda da minha m\u00e3e para estudar, que por sorte, era boa em matem\u00e1tica quando mais nova. \n\nNos dois \u00faltimos anos (9\u00b0 e 1\u00b0), n\u00f3s tivemos a quarentena por conta do covid. Como muitos alunos, eu fui uma das v\u00e1rias e provavelmente maioria das pessoas que confiaram na cola, com a boa e velha ajudinha do tio Brainly. Mesmo assim, foi necess\u00e1rio estudar as tr\u00eas icas (Matem\u00e1tica, Qu\u00edmica e F\u00edsica) mas sempre dava pra buscar alguma coisinha na net. \n\nS\u00f3 que nesse segundo ano do ensino m\u00e9dio, apresentei muita dificuldade nessas mat\u00e9rias com a volta das aulas presenciais. De in\u00edcio os assuntos estavam at\u00e9 f\u00e1ceis, acho que estudei relativamente bem, mas tirei uma nota baixa em matem\u00e1tica por descuido e em f\u00edsica s\u00f3 por dificuldade mesmo. Em qu\u00edmica, tirei 2,8, mas no caso foi porque botei f\u00e9 que seria f\u00e1cil a prova, mesmo sendo a mat\u00e9ria que mais tenho dificuldade das tr\u00eas. \n\nE s\u00f3 foi piorando cada vez mais. Eu consegui recuperar qu\u00edmica, tirando uma nota perto de 8 + nota de uma miniprova que ele fez. Eu estudei bastante a porcaria do c\u00edrculo trigonom\u00e9trico, mas tirei 3 e alguma coisa, eu passei uma semana estudando f\u00edsica e tirei 4,2, o que acreditem ou n\u00e3o, me deixou feliz na hora, considerando que ao fazer a prova, pensei que tiraria bem menos que isso. \n\nA sala era bem cheia, os professores mal ligavam pra nossas dificuldades, e eu percebia certa raiva deles ao demorarmos a entender algo. Se essas tr\u00eas mat\u00e9rias n\u00e3o existissem, provavelmente ainda estaria na escola, principalmente que estava tirando notas boas nas outas, mas eu n\u00e3o estava mais aguentando chorar por causa de NOTA, nem me sentir uma ac\u00e9fala, e mesmo minha m\u00e3e n\u00e3o sendo exigente, n\u00e3o aguentava mais decepcionar ela. Eu realmente estava sentindo que pela primeira vez na vida ficaria de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o por causa de tr\u00eas mat\u00e9rias que praticamente n\u00e3o v\u00e3o afetar minha vida quando eu cursar o que eu quero. \n\nPor causa disso, decidimos me tirar dessa escola. Isso de certa forma tamb\u00e9m foi bom porque eu tinha um colega com quem j\u00e1 tentei ter um relacionamento, perdi a amizade, e ele falava com todos os amigos dele l\u00e1, menos comigo. Mal conseguia me concentrar nos estudos por causa do remorso constante. Pretendo contar essa hist\u00f3ria um dia completa, mas ainda n\u00e3o estou pronta pra isso. \n\nOs motivos da decis\u00e3o foram:\n\n- Minha dificuldade (que enxerguei como motivo principal. \n- O fato de que no terceiro ano, precisaria em alguns dias; estudar de tarde, e ambas n\u00f3s duas n\u00e3o quer\u00edamos isso de jeito nenhum;\n- Esse garoto, mas n\u00e3o comentava tanto com minha m\u00e3e o al\u00edvio de poder n\u00e3o estar mais naquela situa\u00e7\u00e3o antes de sair da escola de fato. \n- Fugir de um simulado obrigat\u00f3rio do enem (da pr\u00f3pria escola) enorme. \n\nTive que largar o curso de teatro de l\u00e1 que j\u00e1 havia feito antes, mas como gostava muito, tinha decidido fazer de novo, ali\u00e1s, eles j\u00e1 devem ter se apresentado em outubro. Continuo com meus cursos de piano e ingl\u00eas, ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o fez tanta falta. N\u00e3o sinto falta de praticamente ningu\u00e9m na escola, considerando que sempre fui meio isolada e t\u00edmida e gostava mais do espa\u00e7o da escola em si. \n\nEla me colocou na escola estadual em que uma amiga trabalha, em um distrito de uma cidade. Minha m\u00e3e est\u00e1 de webtrabalho e a escola at\u00e9 hoje est\u00e1 em reforma, e talvez s\u00f3 volte ao presencial ano que vem. Por incr\u00edvel que pare\u00e7a queria que voltasse logo, para eu descobrir como \u00e9 o ambiente da escola e se eu vou gostar de l\u00e1 de fato. At\u00e9 agora, eles sempre v\u00eaem mandando atividades que valem pontos, e eu sempre consigo fazer a tempo, e as provas at\u00e9 agora foram super tranquilas (obviamente j\u00e1 que est\u00e3o online, mas quero logo poder descobrir como vai ser no presencial, acho que n\u00e3o vai mudar muito). \n\nPra voc\u00eas perceberem a diferen\u00e7a, enquanto a professora de matem\u00e1tica ainda estava avan\u00e7ando no assunto do c\u00edrculo trigonom\u00e9trico, que estava ficando cada vez mais complicado, eu cheguei na escola com o professor ensinando MATRIZES, que foi uma del\u00edcia. E no momento a de f\u00edsica est\u00e1 ensinando sobre ondas eletromagn\u00e9ticas, que \u00e9 um assunto que j\u00e1 vi anteriormente. \n\nDe qualquer forma, queria saber a opini\u00e3o de voc\u00eas. Eu deveria ter me esfor\u00e7ado mais? Sinto certa culpa ao pensar que poderia ter feito isso e ter conseguido, talvez me trazendo sentimentos de realiza\u00e7\u00e3o. Eu gosto de pensar que muitos eventos convenientes estavam favorecendo essa decis\u00e3o, e que se tiver sido a decis\u00e3o errada, no futuro saberei. Minha real preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 conseguir passar no vestibular de certa faculdade e finalmente poder cursar psicologia. \n\nSe tiverem perguntas, n\u00e3o hesitem em perguntar. Seria muito bom se pudessem compartilhar suas pr\u00f3prias experi\u00eancias tamb\u00e9m. \n\nRESUMO: Fui para uma escola bem mais tranquila por causa de dificuldade, fiz a escolha certa ou deveria ter me esfor\u00e7ado mais?"

Goal was being able to have the correct colors in the dots? sorry, i really can't remember\n\nOther details: i remember level names such as \"female\", \"male\", etc. (the layouts of the connected dots are in the shape of a female sign [\u2640\ufe0f]\n\nAttempts to find the game: i've searched in google and google play the words \"watercolor, puzzle, mixing colors\" (i feel like the title was a fancy spelling of watercolor? or at least it starts with a W...?)\n\nthat's about it i guess, hope that anyone knows what game this is"

I knew that it was supposed to be raspberry lemonade, but it tasted like raspberry limeade. And because i thought i was just tripping i double checked the wrapper. The lemons were green bro. Im not kidding bro i still have the wrapper and i got trolled or something im still so consfused to this day. It wasnt bad tho honestly, B tier",

What do you guys think he should do? I feel really bad that I can\u2019t help him."

I then go to the bathroom and while I was there I looked to the clock that was placed there. 1) It wasn\u2019t placed at its usual place. 2) it was floating. 3) it didn\u2019t look right (instead of the usual 12,1,2,3.. etc it looked 12,5,7,3,2,1..etc) \n\nI immediately thought \u201cThats weird... this is definitely not real- wait how do i try to take this chance and go to hogwarts now?\u201d And I just concentrated on the idea of going there But ofc I didn\u2019t have time to do so since i was in the bathroom. After that failure I somehow decided to end this dream and I woke up.\n\n\nSecond one that I literally just experienced right now. I was having a dream in 3rd POV about who knows what (I remember some scenes tho) but then i turned in my \u201csleep\u201d and ofc that wasn\u2019t real. So I thought \u201cnow that this dream ended.. why not actually try now and say affirmations and go to hogwarts?\u201d I tried two times but in each of those times every time I said an affirmation my heart rate picked up and started beating fast and then when i open my eyes I\u2019m still in my bed. After I failed I thought \u201ceh i give up trying\u201d and then I actually woke up \n\n\nWas that actual awareness and me possibly starting to have control in my dreams or whats going on exactly? And if thats a great sign, how do i use this to my advantage to then make this a success?\n\n(edit) I wasn\u2019t actually trying to shift on those nights and they happened randomly"

Tell her to put her all into it, but school is always an important plan b. The percentage of people who become popular streamers is very low, and the percentage of people who become pro gamers is even lower. Strike a deal with her that you\u2019ll support her dreams, but she needs to stay on top of school. You\u2019re a really cool parent for this cuz my parents are old-fashioned, traditional, and they never took gaming seriously at all. I once told them I was a top 500 player in the game in North America just for fun and they didn\u2019t compliment me at all.

Tensions come about when you have Stormcloaks fighting to preserve their faith and culture, and you throw salt in the eye of your benefactor by secretly aiding the empire all the while claiming to be neutral in war that threatens the people your living amongst. \n\nIf for whatever reason I was taken in as a refugee in Ukraine and the Russian invasion looked bad, I had a business serving Ukrainian citizens it would look really bad and stoke some uneasy tensions if I threw my hands up and said Russia or Ukraine this isn't my problem deal with it.",

If you have any other strategy please share with us ;)\n\n When I'm against sett, I'm aways trying to:\n\n - Proc grasp with shield (try to stack grasp in minions when it's cooldown is 2~4 seconds left, then you'll instantly throw the shield after)\n\n - Q him at max range when he farms \n\n - Be agressive only if I have E + there's a minion to go back + I'm on a spot where he won't stun me. \n\n - kitting him so he have to walk to hit you, poppy almost aways doesn't win AA trades, you have to be careful while you have cooldowns.\n\n Don't worry about not being perfect, it's okay as long as you have these behaviors in mind, try to not push the wave if you're not dominating him, since you can't run easily from him (or some junglers) if there's no minions in your back, this saves you from being punished when being agressive. Have in mind that you can't give him any advantage since he outscales you very fast in early game (ruined king). If you can't win, then try to stay even.\n\n In those situations we're you can't kill him don't throw the shield at any possible moment, if you do this his wave will focus you and yours will consequently push (have this in mind speacially if you're not the prior laner and he builds life steal from ruined king or other stuff). Stay safe, not pushing will grant you a safe farm. This is not so realiable, but if you play like that, usually people lose patience and start making bad/risky plays, like diving you etc, maybe going to other lanes too, so be careful with that. If the people lost their patience, maybe you can get a tower or kill based on their errors, but again, that depends on the player, don't rely on this. In a game you're not so ahead, play to support your team the best you can, since is a sett, itens like Thorn mail or Frozen Heart are useful, and will also help against adcs and some mid/jgs. \n\n I don't have a example specifically for this, but there's this play I did against a Sett (also Air Slam).\n\n https://youtu.be/4UtQSf9nE5U\n\n you can notice that even with me being ahead I'm careful with his AAs and W, I keep walking to max my efficiency of receiving/dealing damage, walking in circles when he will possibly use his W, and when I notice that he's dead, I block his path."

That's bullshit :) I also thought the gods would choose you, but I grew tired of waiting and said fuck this and started reading about deities I was interested in, their myths and associations and stuff. I had the strongest pull towards Freyja, so I decided to contact her through meditation (basically I didn't know what I was doing. I was like Freyja, Freyja, will you work with me in my head) got no answer until I tried again a week later. She said yes and I still didn't know what I was doing even though I had spent a few months researching. I've found out that praying (basically just talking to the deity, even about the most random stuff) and offerings are a good way to get to know them and vice versa. Tell them how you feel about them and communicate about what you are willing to do and apologize if you feel like you've done something wrong. Pray them for help or strength, ask that they would let you feel their energy and presence, for them to be with you. And after time, you will start to 'see' them in the world around you, feel them, love them (ex. I say hello to the sun every day I see it because of Apollon). Remember, the god can set boundaries and so can you. They may say no to your request but you can do the same, but be respectful. It hurts no one to dedicate a candle, give an offering and introduce yourself to a deity. They may not become your bestie right away, but they will appreciate the attention and energy you give them, as longs as you are not insulting them. \n\nI hope this helps. Feel free to ask more. Good luck on your journey <3",

                "body": " Hello every beautiful soul reading this!\n\nThis is my story from one religion and beliefs to another. I don\u2019t know if this is inspirational or not but I wanted to share it with someone anyways. \n\nI was a Christian. It\u2019s still hard for me to say in past tense, but it\u2019s true. I was baptized as a baby and grew up with only mild Christian influence around me. My country\u2019s mostly Lutheran. The religion was never forced on me, my family was not very religious, my mom deadass has an altar for Buddha. We had a priest in weddings, baptism, funerals, but that was mostly it. And then of course at about age 15 we go to a confirmation camp. It\u2019s a big deal for young people, mostly because we usually get gifted money and our \u2018first\u2019 cross necklace. For me it was a beautiful experience, because I had my first spiritual awakening during that week. It\u2019s a long story, but for short, one of the counselors had the gift of tongues. I was going through a rough time dealing with depression and I later found out my bunny had died the day that I left for the camp. Half of us cried the latter half of the week so I wasn\u2019t the only one going through something. But when I decided to stay longer for the evening prayers, the counselor asked to bless me and asked if it was okay that she spoke with tongues. I was interested af so I said yes. I don\u2019t remember exactly what she told me but how I described it to people was: something I needed to hear but would never ask for. That was the first time I actually believed there was something bigger out there.\n\nI went to this training to be kind of a helping counselor for these camps (it was kinda popular as well, and you also get paid) mainly because I wanted to figure things out with this awakening. What did I believe? I like(d) the atmosphere of a mass and it was quite open minded, but it never really hit me. I had been spiritual before (crystals, meditation, tarot) but all of that changed almost a year after my confirmation. \n\nI tumbled onto witchcraft. Studied it for a few weeks straight and then already called myself (to myself) a practicing witch. It felt like I had found myself, my path in life. At that point I kept it out of my religious beliefs. I didn\u2019t want to call myself anything else than a witch. \n\nBut from the beginning I was super into deity work and spirit work. And at the end of that (last) summer, I said fuck it. I started researching deities I found interesting and it was Freyja who I longed for the most. Her beautiful strength and power. At this point I had heard of what deity work might be like and how to start but I was still so so confused. But I really wanted to work with her. So one day I meditated and called out for her. I didn\u2019t hear anything back. About a week later I tried again but the results were the same. Except half an hour later my dog who was laying on my bed with me looked like he saw something, he almost barked and it really *looked like he saw someone in my room*. I was like holy shit and took out my pendulum and runes. Asked Freyja if she was present and then asked a few basic questions just to make sure it wasn\u2019t something else. She said yes, answered my questions and left after a while, my dog calmed down. I was asked if I wanted some ice cream from downstairs. It was summer, of course I did. But for the first time ever I had this strong desire to have a strawberry one and not chocolate. I always eat chocolate if it\u2019s possible. So I ate the strawberry one for her and that night asked my spirit guide to give me a sign that it really was Freyja who I contacted. She confirmed it. \n\nAnd here we are over half a year later. I work with Apollon as well and I\u2019m so grateful for them both. Compared to my prior beliefs, when I met Freyja it felt like I had found my *God*. It never felt like this when I was just a Christian, He didn\u2019t respond or comfort me when I was begging for help. Maybe it wasn\u2019t meant to be, and that\u2019s okay. \n\nI have nothing against Christianity and I\u2019m really interested in Jesus, but I have decided not to call myself Christian anymore. I will probably always be that on paper, since I\u2019d like to stay in church so I can support it and give my future children the possibility to experience the religion as I once did. \n\nI\u2019m interested in everything, so eclectic pagan witch is probably the most comfortable title for me. And I am proud of it and myself, proud to finally be able to let go and call myself a pagan.\n\nThank you for reading!"

But the problem is that sometimes they're really long or there's so many of them. Sometimes it takes me over a page of my notebook to write one dream down and it takes almost 30 minutes. And as a fantasy writer and reader it's no wonder, but I dream of complex fantasy worlds with many social changes mixed with the themes of my day/week. Like it's so complicated. And last night for example I remembered at least 5 different and complex dreams and in one of them I realized I was dreaming (I'm learning lucid dreaming). But like that's way too much for me to remember and write down. And the reason I'm asking this sub is because dreams are sometimes a way for me to receive messages from my spirit guide or deity whether I ask or don't ask for them. The point is that I find it important that I keep up with the themes of my dreams and for other reasons I analyze them once in a while. But how can I create a method that doesn't require me to cut an hour from my night's sleep?!?\n\nSorry for the rant :D Do you guys have any tips? Insight? I would appreciate anything<3 Thank you!"

I just wanna know if I should just be patient or make more effort. **I am so sorry this is so long. But I would appreciate any piece of advice <3** (for the short version read the last three paragraphs)\n\nBackground: I'm kinda a 'beginner' in deity work (started my first deity relationship with Freyja this summer). But I've been SO SO SO interested in working with different deities, and since thing were so good with Freyja, I let myself consider if I would like to work with someone else, if it really felt right. And I may want some help with my studies, so I looked up deities of knowledge, wisdom, learning etc. Athena felt like the best option, because I've been really into the greek pantheon. But it didn't feel quite like it was meant to be and when I asked my guides they weren't sure either, so I accepted dropped it. \n\nSoon after I had covid. My next period in school was starting in a few days and I always stress it when you have a whole new schedule and new people and don't know where to sit in the class (I'm in senior high school and don't have a lot of friends). If I would miss the first few day, I would be so anxious and I was unsure if I **could** even go to school because of it. That's when I remembered that Apollo was also the god of sickness and healing. I started researching him enough that I wouldn't offend him if I were to try to contact him. \n\nAfter I had been crying and had a few anxiety attacks and I had decided to finally ask him for help. It was weird because I had never asked a deity I wasn't actively working with for something. I drew him a picture (a pretty bad one but I tried lol) of things I had learned about him, lit a small yellow/orange candle and PRAYED. Like those were the moments when I actually **begged** for him to help me, first so that I wouldn't have covid (when I was waiting for the official test results) and then for him to help me make it to school as soon as possible, preferably on the first day, but I didn't say that. And like magic the next day I was almost fine, when I had had fever the day before. And it's really unusual for me since I have these breathing issues that makes every small cold longer and at least makes me cough like I'm dying. I went to school on the second day and everything worked out fine.\n\nOf course I thanked him a lot and really appreciated him he kept hovering in my thoughts for a few weeks. And as he is the god of medicine and healing I figured that he could actually help me with my studies to become a doctor as it is my dream. And then I decided that I wanted to work with him, if the feeling was mutual, of course. So after a lot more research, two days ago I tried to communicate with him. I put on some Apollo themed meditation music and the second I closed my eyes I felt like I was being hugged (not by a physical being). It was a warm, safe, happy feeling. Like a big spiritual embrace. It felt so good and welcoming and I'm almost certain that it was indeed Apollo's presence I felt. After that my body was just pure relaxation. I tried to communicate with tarot and a pendulum but didn't get proper answers. It made me feel a bit down and I restarted the music and decided to just meditate and see if anything happened. After a few breaths I felt the same feeling of embrace and after it the most comfortable feeling of relaxation and sun light-like happiness and lightness. But didn't feel a presence anymore after a while and I was just confused. \n\nI made a candle and lighted it, gave a few offerings, prayed asking if he could send a sign if he wanted to work with me. I haven't felt any presence, his candle is just still and I've seen no signs, no dreams. I know it's not been long but I'm wondering whether I should do more or just be patient. \n\nThank you!"

Should i risk it and postpone my projects till the cape (might) rise even more or just sell it now, ensure my profit and get to action?"

For some reason tho the door was closed and it sounded like the shower was on. I was supposed to be home alone. I opened the door and yes, the shower was on. A voice spoke saying \u201cUhhh my fellow american I\u2019m in here\u201d and I was shocked. I walked out and closed the door. I waited in the hallway wondering if I should call the cops or not, but then eventually I heard the shower turn off. A few minutes went by, and then I saw him. The door opened and former president Barack Obama walked out of my bathroom. He came up to me, towel wrapped around his waist, smelled my nose and proceeded to say: \u201cok so uhh my fellow american this never happened\u2026 uhh don\u2019t tell michelle\u201d and then he moonwalked out the door and into a presidential limo.\n\nCan someone explain why this happened?

Had less bright colors and was incredibly detailed. You moved around to different shops by scrolling. Definitely early to mid 2000s. I don't think it's on the app store anymore.

I took off my cardigan because it was feeling hot. I had a tank top underneath so obviously there were no problems. But out of nowhere the 5 yr old boy says \"You should take THIS one off too \ud83e\udd2a\"\n\nKinda weird but funny from a 5 year old so I'm like lol whatever. Little did I know what was to come. 6 year old girl screams \"BOOBIES! BOOBIES BOOBIES WE WANT BOOBIES!!!\" and they all start chasing me around the house trying to pull my shirt off while 6 year old girl screams boobies and 5 year old boy chants \"boobs boobs boobs!!\" In the background. I turned on stern babysitter mode and they calmed down. I later asked them why they were trying to pull off my shirt and 6 year old girl claimed that \"We want milk.\"\n\nWhere did I go wrong....."

                "body": "This has been something I've wondered about for a long while, and I don't believe the world will ever come to one decision on it. Some Christians hate anything having to do with it, some are deeply involved in the lgbtq community and there are many in-between people who haven't decided what to think. For my part I can't imagine hating someone because they don't feel attracted to the opposite gender, and I believe we are called to love everyone.\n\nThere is also the verse in Leviticus telling a man not to be sexually involved with a man. This really confuses because of the thing with the other translation saying a man shouldn't be sexually involved with a boy meaning no pedophilia. (Which makes sense because I'm sure that ALL of us agree that is in no way ok or right)\n\nBut even if that is the more accurate translation what  about the point that God made men for women as Jesus is for the church? I have talked about this with my mother who said that women need a man to balance them and vice versa. But then that led me to wondering why can't a woman balance a woman the same way?? Is it a physical thing with the natural strength and mindset of a man balancing the natural femininity of a woman? Or is it something more of the personality and mindset we develop as we grow and change as humans? If that is so, then why can't two women (a masc lesbian and a femme lesbian) be together?\n\nAnd then, if the man no man translation is correct what does that mean for women? I'm pretty sure it's applying to all humans because it really wouldn't make sense for only women to be allowed to be gay right.\n\nAnd this is my last main problem for now but why do we care so much about this problem vs. other things that are also sinfull and hurtfull in the world. Surely a woman wanting to marry to love of her life-even if it goes against what the Bible tells us to-is not as problematic as the view Christians have created for ourselves. The whole internet loathes us and mocks us. And honestly, how could you blame them?? I saw a video on Reddit just a couple minutes ago of a group of old men holding up signs saying that Gay people, among other things, will go to hell. A boy who saw the sign starting yelling at them so loudly you couldn't understand anything he was saying accept curses, and he was trying to hurt the men. Neither of them handled it well, especially the boy, but the men also literally threw him to the ground. We are actively turning people away from Christianity. If Jesus hadn't forgiven our sins one lie would send a person to Hell as much as a sweet gay man.\n\nI think it sounds like I've already decided where I stand on this but really all of this is questions. If being gay really is bad I don't want to condem people and hate them. I don't want to have to tell someone I think their love is wrong. I am only 15 and have many questions and would love to hear the thoughts of the people who have lived longer than me. Thank you for taking the time to read this to the end."

Then a few weeks ago we went to see a movie together and she showed me a picture of her daughter and she's going on to be 4 years, it was so weird. It's like I blink and people around me get older, but I don't feel like they change, not fundamentally anyway. I pick up/continue conversations we had last time we met, just to realise, so much happened in between.\n\nThe moment I say bye to them, it's sorta like 'they freeze in time' for me. (and my time flies) It's only when we pick up again, I notice that time has flown by and all kinds of things have happened in that time. (Like she's pregnant again \"already\") Friendship with an ISTP is not for everyone. I could go for years (and do) not seeing my friends, but things don't change for me. If it does for them, and they can't continue the friendship because they'd feel neglected or awkward when we meet again. Then it's just not a match, for either of us.\n\nEdit: And here's a pretty good example.

But anyways I still want a list that packs a punch but is still dynamic enough to fall back on a plan B or C. \n\nPlan A would be to get both scout the enemy and behind enemy lines as secondaries. I would try to clear one flank to create space for rangers to drop in from reserve/deepstrike and stack some points on that front. The Vyper and Walker are sacrifices to achieve bel points in case I go second. As a third secondary I would take either warp ritual or scry futures (only in some cases) \n\nIf for instance my opponent has a lot of screening units this plan becomes a bit more difficult to achieve, however I could then change some secondaries, for instance taking banners or khaine.\n\nSo what do you guys think?

These being Oaths of moment and assassinate. \n\nOften I also take EoF but that's probably going to change with the new missions. \n\nThe list itself is in my opinion fairly balanced and should be able to counter most army types, it being hordes, melee etc.\nThat being said let me describe the general tactics I use while in play.\n\nDeployment would be reasonably defensive, with the exception of the alpha strike VV blob. And in some cases the dreads. For these it really depends on line of sight possibilities of the AT on my opponents side. Both the librarian as the techmarine would remain nearby though.\n\nIf I go first most of time I would throw the VV blob with MoA and infiltrators at a weakspot in my opponents army. If necessary denying him his Overwatch with supressors. Theoretically It could also be possible the I use my inceptors instead together with my captain to delete something essential, for now this has not yet occured though.\n\nIf I go second the blob will be deployed behind my battle line out of line of sight if possible.

This evening, just 24h later, I had apparently died, had to respawn, and saw that all Oxygen was gone from the ship's tanks. How?!?\n\nWhen that happened before, at that time I still had the ship pressurized, in that case also the room my cryopod was in was completely without oxygen. I soon depressurized the whole ship to make sure it is not because of hull damage or door shenanigans.\n\nWhen that did not happen, and I respawned normally in the Cryopod, it seems that was when I had the O2/H2 Generator run 24/7, but that is certainly not reasonable. The tanks should be able to keep me alive and they reliably did in the past! Had something changed?\n\nStrangely, I can not see the O2 input from my 12 Oxygen farms all over the ship arriving in the Oxygen Tanks. I wonder if I it just is not displayed properly in realtime?? I think, if half if them show 0.5L per minute, then a single tank set on stockpile=On should show something happening, right?\n\nWhat weirds me out even more, is that the only other frozen Player on my ship is still marked in the Pod no change since he logged out at least a month ago, while I had died of suffocation several times dirung that time period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan some please enlighten me what is going on here or what I should look for?

I can't seem to find anything about it, so maybe it is not a general bug?\n\nI play on a fairly old star system savegame; I did not build too much in it, it is just old. And it has a lot of mods, mostly blocks, an Oxy/Hydr. rebalance and realistic O2 consumption, a food and survival mod, and Build Info, the usual Encounters spawn mod with some mods to spawn from.\n\nAlways after playing for some time, my game HUD freezes. This is annoying to reproduce because it takes a while, it probably takes about half an hour. Then suddenly every movements halts, my character makes a fist as if I want to place something, the whole HUD disappears, except for the three bars for foof, water and stamina from that survival mod. I can press ESC, the menu appears, I can save the game and all that works. So I can leave and reload the game. So the vanilla HUD disappears, I can not move, mouse wheel still rotates the block in front of me, but all the menu and inventory buttons don't do anything. The game still runs and I can hear the machines. Though it didn't happen in a fight yet so my obervations are limited. I wondered whether this is an Alt-Tab issue and my Windoes just messes with the focus, but alt-tabbing in and out does not change anything.\n\nI don't know what to do with this, I really would appreciate some ideas what to look for. Or did anyone else have that before? Did the big update bring some mod incompatibility that could play a role here?\n\nI want to take this savegame and its mods to a dedicated server, but this also makes me worry. I really hope we can solve this. Many thanks in advance!"

I've research cognitive functions quite a lot but I just can't type myself. I'm so unsure of which functions I use the most and all that.\n\nI've gotten Infp several times. I've gotten Enfp, Infj, Intp a lot and also Entp and Enfj a few times. I know the functions are very different but I kind of see myself in all of them. \n\nStress has made it very complicated. I kind of got really angry at everyone all the time but I kept it all in. I don't usually cry but sometimes I do when I'm alone. Lately I haven't cried at all exept today. Finally all the comotion causing my stress is gone and I feel empty, so drained. Then my mom starts nagging about chores and I just started crying. It was so weird it felt like I haven't allowed myself to feel anything. Only on the inside I've allowed myself to feel. I daydreamed troughout the past month and the entire summer. detachibg was the easiest thibg to do. \n\nNow that I'm finally done with my important exams I feel overwhelmed by everyhtibg else happening in the world. I guess I feel so angry and frustrated at everythibg because I haven't really let myself express any emotion. I think I've always been pretty logical at rational but oh boy the past months were just strategies after strategies on how to survive my exams ect. See I postponed reading and slacked of which was a huge mistake on my part. When I realised I was screwed I started studying the I ate and slept and spent time on Youtube. That was all. \n\nI did spend time with my friend and of course at school I got to spend time with them but I just felt kind of empty. Only one of my friends knows how stressed I've actually been. I'm just good at pretending everything is okay and I acted carefree all the time. Maybe I didn't want to rant to them or maybe I was just fooling myself. Who knows. \n\nOkay I strated rambling and venting. Anyway I really want to know my mbti type since I'm not sure what type I am. I think I have Fi but at the same time Idk. Ne definetly sounds like me especially looking at my notes and my thought process. Although lately I think I've started using Ni. I think I might have Ti idk. And yeah maybe se or si. I'm just confused.\n\nIf you read this entire thing thank you. If you can help me figure out my mbti by analyzing my rant thank you. I'm sorry for such a long paragraph and also my English. Feel free to ask me questions or something!!"

This is when i start to get stuck. I was trying to do fingerpass or double charge, yet my pen was too short i couldnt do it. i bought a trash chinese factory pen mod for 1 buck, which i am using until now. i was able to do double charge,which took me an hour to learn, smooth fingerpass, which took me 2 days to master, and reverse sonic,neo sonic,TA reverse and harmonic, which i learned today.

You staring doesn't mean me me noticing, and in MY perspective it seems like you're a mindless teacher that just decided to burst at me for chatting like 10 mins at class! Above all of that, this teacher I'm talking about is going to teach me for THREE YEARS STRAIGHT, and it's only been like 5 lessons!

Now NO, you just HAD to yell at me, huh? Shame me in front of the whole class? You think that gives you power, or something? Instead of giving a kind warning so that I'd know I'm being inconsiderate and shut up, or patting my shoulder to let me know, you had to give ONE-SIDED hints, and yell at me for not noticing those INVISIBLE HINTS."

(like mostima and executor) but if you are unwillingly point your gun at another sankta, your halo will only be broken (like enforcer)\n\nMy description after staring at all the angels wings and halos in AK: (elite one only)\n\nEnforcer: Halo broken, no significant sign of black/burnt halo, his wings are half black. Probably killed a sankta because of his work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMostima: burnt but not broken halo, burnt and shattered wings. Attempted to kill andoain \n\n&#x200B;\n\nExu: Normal halo, there are some shatter looking lines on her wings, could be the pattern tho.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nexecutor: black but not broken halo, has a device attached to it, half black wings, probably killed some sanktas because of his works need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nArene: normal halo, black wings (probably because of his breed which is prob normal)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdnachiel: crooked halo, himself mentioned that its strange so its prob just a deficiency\n\n&#x200B;\n\nambiel: didn't kill any sankta, normal halo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthanks for reading"

I reposted it again without any of my end remarks that could be considered as unfaithful and opinionated.\n\nI would also like to recognise that neither this post or any of my other posts show my religious or personal standings. I stated facts, and then questions regarding those facts. Just because they\u2019re something pushed down and unknown by a large amount of members doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be discussed.\n\nI in fact have been a member for my whole life. I should be on a mission right now, however I couldn\u2019t go due to chronic physical and mental illnesses. I am taking the time now to make sure I fully understand the gospel ins and outs before proceeding further with it.\n\nIf the gospel is true then I should be able to ask these questions in the way that I am (without bias or opinions) and find truth.\n\nI would like you to note that taking down posts like this is information control and largely why the church is considered a cult by outsiders. I showed no malicious intent, I have come here to learn and ask questions. I have tried my hardest to come in without an already established opinion and I am sorry it doesn\u2019t appear that way.\n\nI would also like to note that you are telling me to come back and ask in faith. As it appears based on you taking this down, you are asking me to come at this from a point of believing. Which is funny to me because you\u2019ve shown me you don\u2019t want opinionated posts on this subreddit. Believing of which is an opinion in which is unseen. How do you expect me to find the facts in the gospel if you tell me to just believe? \n\nIf you control all the information and questions I have and tell me they\u2019re wrong, that I need to be a better member/believer to ask these questions, that just makes me believe the gospel less.\n\nIt appears to me that you didn\u2019t take this down for any other reason than you don\u2019t have a good answer for it, and don\u2019t want others seeing it. Which again, is information control.\n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong on all of this, I am here for a civil conversation/debate. Help me see where I am wrong, because I have only gotten vague reasons for it. Reasons in which I\u2019ve tried to improve on, and then still get in trouble.\n\nAgain, sorry for all the trouble. I wasn\u2019t aware that reposting in this fashion was against the rules, as I changed what it originally was taken down for. I won\u2019t do that again. Thank you for your time\n\nEdit: I took down the \u201cProve Your Beliefs\u201d post awhile ago after it got taken down. It largely was asking how we know that God speaks through the spirit, and that it isn\u2019t confirmation bias. I didn\u2019t intend it as an attack on belief/faith, I can see how it would be considered that. I also apologise for that and thought I\u2019d address it as well.",

It should start off as counties where the people of a city state what ever voted for internal laws as one than state where all cities/counties what ever you wanna call it vote now this is more for america because places like China, India, Australia & Russia dont have states but still I'm sure are or could be broken down like so where they're still a country. I love countries I love culture I dont love separation of man & I dont love that were close ourselves off so much par say & share the world a little more. I mean I'm almost everything & my DNA proves that so I should be allowed to go & visit these places etc. Anyways from that its voted by country & everything is done by computers & idc if you can make a system & algorithm like Bit coin etc. Than you can create a un hackable 100%legit voting system & the more it spreads through counties/city states to states them selves to country to the whole world it just becomes more secure I also think most of us dont care about our government & our voices aren't being heard because of the wealthy & greedy. So for state to country we all vote & it could be a annual thing people dont serve nearly as long & when you are doing your political doing it's not so much as  job but like jury duty you only can be in it for a bit than back to your normal job or its like a side gig for a bit & you do it for the love of this planet \"plants, oceans, animals\" & humanity. Space exploration should be a global topic & funded even though in time the whole money debt greed stupidity will go away so again after the state its country after the country votes that's more like every state & city/countie state follows like murder it's all equal across the board, you know common sense shit they also communicate to the states where the states communicates with the city states I'm just sticking with city states because I also believe we need to eventually become a bit closer but taller so life can be more preserved instead of spreading so much in width I mean we all heard & seen wildlife being more & more in closed so they're in someone back yard will no shit because your house is on their back & front yard... anyways & than countries goes to global where we all as the people because you know were all related somewhere in time & you know both science & religion says so & also both says we came from this earth we all are a part of this earth just one said the clay of the earth...... the other says bubble bubble that soup smells nasty & it looks nasty but look life it's a single cell organism first sign..... of life & I mean all those fucking atoms were all made of has existed since you know what both science & religion says....... God Spoke, Big Bang, OMmMm\nWake up people or were all fucked, doomed & the ones who have the highest rate of surviving are the ones who manipulated the masses. Controls them through deceit, lies, tricks & false promises I mean look at Nikola Tesla's history & when he was alive. I'm just saying we all came from this planet its proven so who really has rights to own any of it for themselves or a select few because in my opinion they're wasting & burning it up, putting in their mouths because they think it looks cool but its ugly as fuck say this is worth more than this because its lined with it or embroidered or made from the same shit but worth more for a name.... oooo a name OooOoOo yeah makes sense or we have to make the best versions but also a crappier version because not everyone can get the best version & the crappy one is the one that lasts shorter where that's just waiting resources instead of making the best of the best lasts for years & years & years. Fix the broken ones create better versions trade offs recycle older models for the newer ones saving resources all around.",

I'm not over myself & I even tell guys yeah bud youre a good looking guy I could see why girls would be all oooo blah blah blah. & I always had females either innocently flirt with me or just be straight foward & tell me I'm gorgeous, handsome etc. My problem is im toned in ways but skinny & I can't gain weight which makes it hard to gain mass & straight foward & it's a stupid ass game, girl I'm not here for games I dont cheat, I dont lure or play head games you're fucking beautiful I like who you seem to be inside wanna go out... idk lol, I'm a mixed plate straight up I'm part oriental i have almond shaped eyes, I'm part polynesian & raised in Hawaii but but born in colorado where I'm now back, i have high defined cheek bones because of my Indian& oriental side, I have thick hair which looks good short & long because I have curly hair all black, my beard grows in thick & full with black, blonde, brown & red hair from my irish german, Scandinavian, I'm. 5% black im just assuming thats why im 6'2\". I m personally going through a martial thing of 10 years being with now 2 years of living with just me & her parents which she left us & ghosted me, I was with them in Arizona those 2 years she has a new boyfriend in Nevada I don't play that. I found her when I was 22 only had sex with 3 girls before her 2 I dated 1 was like a couple nights but I wanted to date but eh, I lost my virginity at 21 & trust it was by choice I've had the popular girls i guess you can say idk there were clicks not popularity per say in high school all knew me talked to me & tried hooking me up with their other friends who knew me since 7th grade & knew my name before I knew them. The one problem about us nerdy guys especially if they're good looking is they care to much & most girls have a nerdy side to especially these days theres a lot more pretty nerdy girls that are proud of it back than it was more secretive. Ive had one of the most prettiest girls in our school who was dating college kids at the time sitting to my right side asking about me seeing episode 3 of star wars how cool star wars was & how she thought the actor for Anikan was cute as I replied how pretty the actress who played Amadala was, I got along including us nerdy gamer/anime/comics guys with everyone but we had the football & wrestling the skater punk & ROTC etc. kids play yugioh card game & pokemon ruby & sapphire. Its also Hawaii I've only had a few cute girls ask me why I like Anime & thought it was for kids only \" watch neon genesis evangelion, Akira.... AKIRA... Ninja Scroll, Afro Samurai, cowboy bebop, Vampire Hunter D I'd tell them. Not Akira the caps way but doesn't matter. But I also boogie board, hiked, camped, I love being in nature & gardening, I know cars decently, I've done construction drive heavy machinery5 I wrestled with our wresting captain who played Yugioh & was also golden gloves so he'd teach me boxing which came to me learning more forms of martial arts down the road.. sorry this is a bit of a rant & the punctuation im not in the mood to be my editor, the females in Hawaii were more open on how they think you're cute etc. Atleast to me, beyond that I'm 34 & 18 years olds ask me if their bag makes them look pretty, & or how I look 10 years younger but genetics. I personally dont see anyone unattractive were all unique & have beautiful qualities to us inside & out I'm 100%straight by the way I'm just very spiritual, & I even though I see beauty in all people I still have preferences of who & what I'm Sexually attracted to & she needs to be inside & out, I've met beautiful woman who had very little beauty withen & I'd tell them how beautiful they are than tell them their personality is ugly which makes them ugly outside. I say it how I see it & i dont do fake people like the Kardashians their all ugly to me. So yeah take good pictures of yourself with good lighting has anyone watched America's next top model I'd binge it for the whole show in general not just the pretty girls, put yourself more out theres nerdy or what ever & own it I know why people in school were magnetized towards us, we owned our nerdiness which just made it cool to others who you wouldnt think or believe but are just as nerdy, have confidence & one key of confidence is not caring about the others opinion so much especially if its unharmful, also knowing not thinking fuck that choo choo train with the coal powered engine going up the hill thinking it can with thinking theres room for doubt & error be a bullet train running on magnetisim & propulsion knowing it fucking can, when you know something theres no room for doubt or error. Again like I know I fucked up with my punctuation of commas but idc because this was ment for being helpful & maybe it can help others including females stop playing this dumb game & just say it how you see it guys like being told nice things too we all have insecurities its learning to say fuck that I know I'm skinny but I can do one arm pull ups I'm still toned I've scrapped big Samoans before & beat their ass cause I know how scrap, dug trees out of the ground & now lifting boxes 70+ by myself like nothing & keeping up plus some on everyone at my job who are all bigger than me. I know martial arts etc. Also be broad of interest just not nerdy things but other things theres a whole world so dont be consumed be a jack of all no need to master them all but maybe 1 or 2 master & than that who's really a master?",

The government was making sure people stayed short....sooo, the government was putting some strunt growing stuff in the military preferably the Marines families water on Oahu, so they could test out this new long term biological warfare so they could keep certain races short like the Chinese maybe even smaller which is like my 1 out of 5 oriental ancestor I have in me (I'm a mutt & believe everyone else is too).... that's now my conspiracy I'm sticking with it, ooh & the aliens taught them & gave them the chemical/new element & it came from the Greys & that's why they're so short...genius sounds legit...",

I\u2019m currently not in a position where I can seek a formal diagnosis. I\u2019ve seen many therapists and psychiatrists in my life due to moving a lot but currently am not seeing any.  I am now at a point where finding another one is difficult, overwhelming, and oftentimes unhelpful. I\u2019ve tried probably like 10 different medications for depression, anxiety, and adhd but after a lot of side effects I disliked, I couldn\u2019t justify continuing to take them (Turns out there are genetic reasons for that that an integrative psychiatrist found after doing a genetic test). \n\nAnyway, after a lot of research, online testing, and hearing diagnosed autistic people tell stories that I related to I\u2019ve finally realized that my whole life I\u2019ve suffered because of traits I had that others either considered as quirks, overreactions, faults, or just plain weird that were actually something else. I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019ve been forced to live in burnout for the majority of my life to meet other peoples expectations and to survive. For what it\u2019s worth, I think my autistic traits could also be cptsd.. or both. At the very least, I know that I\u2019m neurodivergent and I do have other diagnoses to support that.\n\nAfter a traumatic breakup I\u2019ve been living back at my mom\u2019s house for over 2 years (I\u2019m 30) and I\u2019ve been working from home doing customer service for the past almost 3 years (after 7 years of retail and baristahood). Now that I\u2019m more aware of my burnout and why it\u2019s there I feel a little bit of a self loathing weight lifted off of my shoulders but I still have to deal with the things that burn me out: talking to people all day all the while trying to mask and sound like I have \u201cgood customer service\u201d and \u201csoft skills\u201d while trying to meet certain goals and requirements, follow policies, be \u201cprofessional\u201d, and not lose my composure when I have to talk to rude, condescending, and impatient people. I\u2019m making more money than ever, more than twice as much as my last job but still not enough to pay off my debt and live on my own (which sucks because I think that having my own place would be helpful). I need the income and benefits a full time job provides me but it drains the life out of me. \n\nI\u2019m at a point where anything I have to do outside of my job feels like an overwhelming concept. My time management is\u2026worse than it\u2019s been at other times of my life. I struggle to do any of my day to day tasks often putting them off. I have a lot of creative ideas that I am not following through with. Showering more than like twice a week is an accomplishment. Flossing seems like impossible to do frequently enough to keep my teeth and gums healthy (not in the nest shape the past few years). Any self care routines I try to start for myself are challenging to keep doing consistently and I tend to forget to do them. And making any type of appointment is hard af not to mention trying to find a doctor, psychiatrist, or therapist in my area that takes my insurance and doesn\u2019t suck and ignore everything i say and smack a \u201cdepression and anxiety\u201d label over it all. The prospect of updating my resume and looking for another job is daunting and honestly I don\u2019t know that I qualify for anything other than customer service at this point. \n\nI\u2019ve made a lot of progress on my own and am building systems and mindsets for myself that are helping me heal from the trauma of being undiagnosed and treated like crap over my neurodivergent traits my whole life but I\u2019d love to hear any strategies you feel comfortable sharing for coping with the stress, anxiety, and burnout that being autistic comes with. Any links or videos you have found particularly helpful would be welcomed as well. I do have some books I\u2019ve tried to start but honestly my attention span is currently programmed for shorter pieces of media though I\u2019d still gladly take any book recommendations.. I do have an audible subscription I should be using.  Started using ear plugs when in loud places, playing with slime to help me calm down, and have been trying to communicate my needs and feelings more which has helped. I don\u2019t really have friends I talk to regularly anymore and none that live in my area. Feels lonely over here but the online communities I\u2019ve found help.\n\nTl;dr I\u2019m a 30 year old person who suspects they are autistic and am seeking support and resources from others who are willing to share what has helped them. I\u2019ve displayed neurodivergent traits my whole life but have had to try to meet and exceed neurotypical expectations without proper support or accommodations and am now working a particularly triggering and challenging role given my circumstances to survive."

Not only did I get bullied by peers but by strangers online who trolled me and sometimes sexually harassed me because of my gender. Not only did I struggle with this sort of thing on a day to day basis in adolescence but as an adult every once in a while when I\u2019d try to pick those games up again. I spent about 10 years on WoW and kicked ass because I found wonderful family like guilds that had men and women of all ages. That type of community is pretty rare and kind of unheard of in certain other genres. Anyway, now I mostly play single player games because I don\u2019t have the time to commit to playing like I used to and I don\u2019t want to deal with the emotional labor of being a beginner at a genre I haven\u2019t played in a while.

Pagod na ko sa gobyerno at pagod na ko sa mga gen Xers boomers na walang pake sa mental health naten dahil \"nasa bahay lang naman kayo\". I'm so tired of it all. na gusto ko na lang mag drop but I can't kc as we all know \"wala tayong choice\". waa tayong choice kasi we don't have the privilege or luxury as we live in a shitty government, willful ignorant filipinos, and in a 3rd world country\n\nsorry for my rant is incomprehensible. I'm writing this as of my online class starts soon. as always take care, whoever reading this and thanks for reading my rant"

As the signs progress, it's only natural that they achieve higher balance in their skills which would mean that Aries is the most Cardinal but lacks in other places more than Capricorn does. Because Capricorn sure as hell is better at setting it's own ways (being more fixed than Aries, as it has gone through Taurus) at the expense of losing some of it's own cardinality in the way. \n\nOverall, I do find it interesting that an air sign is the last fixed sign, a water sign the last mutable and an earth sign the last cardinal. Qualities you wouldn't expect in their respective elements. This is part of the reason why I believe zodiac signs only become more well-rounded as they progress.\n\n>As an analogy, I wouldn't say that an equilateral triangle is more triangular than an isosceles triangle.\n\nTriangles don't work in the same way as zodiac signs, John.",

The world is too large a stage. Look at the way the UN is. \n\nWho gets to control the federal government? \n\nWhat language is to be used that will unite everyone? \n\nHow will resources be allocated and shared? \n\nThen there's that small matter of sovereignty. D'you think that countries that have strong national identity, countries that have fought invasion and colonialism are going to willingly give that up again to be under the control of some foreigners some place far-away? \n\nIn the first place, corrupt countries of that sort will have leaders at the helm reluctant to give up the power because they gain a lot from controlling everything within their borders. Secondly, the people will likely not want anything of the sort seeing it as a lack of basic independence, with whatever government in place being a puppet of the federal government. \n\nThese are my views on the matter. So it's a hard no for me. World federalism is a bad idea, let's stick with the somewhat useless but occasionally beneficial international bodies that we already have.",

The first time I usually explain my perspective in a calm and reasonable way, but it never works and I am not a persistent nor persuasive nor respected person. To protect me I have automatic responses like I fawn so that they like me, I freeze so that I can survive, I fly somewhere else to be safe. But what people hate about me is when I fight, sometimes the moment I notice someone disrespecting me and my boundaries I become another person and I will yell at them, I can't control my rage anymore and spit out all the facts. And it kinda helps me keep them away from me. \n\nThat's what happened to me today. I got it all out after a lot of times that I tried to please and be patient, but I still expect adults to grow up and stop making mistakes that I have to pay, so now that the cost was too much it was the time to say stop to them. And I've become the abusive bad guy because they focus on how you said things and not what you said. They know my borderline symptoms and still demanded things from me that I couldn't give, without giving me time to process it and calm down. At least they have backed away but now they respect me less than before. It often ends like this with people.\n\nSo all of them strategies get me nowhere. It seems like it's my fault because instead of reacting in a normal way I always go to the extreme, but I also know that the most relevant people in my life have never wanted anything to do with my boundaries anyway. I'm simply not allowed to have what I want, it's always a matter of their boundaries and mine not being compatible, so I know I'm not meant to be happy with anyone.\n\nI wish I could change people into being more respectful, even though nobody wants to be controlled. Life is like living in a room with precious things and the wind outside always tries to break in through the windows and clumsy children always want to touch my things or play in the room, making accidents that I'm expected to move on from. And apparently you can't yell at metaphorical children to grow up. But I am not their damn parent to be provoked, I already have my illness to live with. So I'm better off alone."

And finding someone who actually gives more than others is not going to be magically helpful, it just seems that way. It's a fantasy. \n\nThe world of people is *okay*. It certainly is to those who have felt loved as a child without having to move a finger to feel like they actually deserve it. Unconditional and mind altering. \n\nSince I'm not one of them, it occurred to me to believe unconsciously that if my therapist or my friend loved me like a parental figure then my life would be solved. I really hate their stupid boundaries, but it's not like it would change a lot if they started giving me what I want. In fact I don't need to be loved now, I need to have been loved then. \n\nUltimately loving ourselves is not the pleasant solution to our problems, but the requirement everybody needs to reach, to be okay in the okay world of okay people. And sometimes we get to give and be given simple acts of love."

My inability to defend myself (which I think is the key point to work on by enforcing coping mechanisms and mental boundaries that other people already have) lowers my self esteem and also increases my paranoia of self, which is my huge distrust towards the one person who has always let me down.

My main choices in the beginning were SSBKK Goku vs Hit, SSB Vegeta vs Rose Goku Black, and this. I really was going to do the U6vU7 one, but then I saw other people post theirs, and I wanted to be original. That left Vegeta vs Black and this, and while Vegeta vs Black would've been fun, I think this one is more necessary for reasons that I'll get into for in the actual character analyses. \n\n**SSJ4 Goku:** \n\nAs for him, I was thinking about how many buffs the LR Gods have gotten since the anniversary. Everyone knows that the buffs to Movie Heroes have been insane, even with the upcoming Gammas, and comparatively, it felt like the SSJ4s were left out to dry. However, people were already doing Goku vs Baby, so I went with an even more niche DDF comparatively; Goku vs Super 17. At first, I was going to make him just SSJ4, but I feel like AGL LR EZA SSJ4 Goku has a strong enough presence on the team to warrant me switching some things around and making him a turn 1 transforming character, of which we only have INT Ribrianne and INT Great Saiyamen. Funnily enough, I guess since this Goku would also be INT, all of those types of characters would be INT. Fortunately, this Goku starting as SSJ Goku, as he does in the anime, means that he'd also be on Super Saiyans and Transformation Boost!\n\nI chose INT as his typing just because there was already a relevant card including SSJ4 Goku of every type. It doesn't hurt him too much, as he already has crit and additionals in his passive, and I guess it makes for another Super INT buff as well.\n\nWhen it comes to his LS, my main thought going into it was that Great/Giant Ape Power (I'll be saying Great Ape Power) needed a leader, but the LS on its own didn't have too great of a team, so it could use a big secondary category. Lo and behold, Accelerated Battle hadn't gotten a team since SSJ2->SSJ3 Goku, and seeing how vast that team was, I thought they'd make a good duo that allows you to run a practical SSJ4 team that still had lots of help outside of them. I chose Bond of Parent and Child because it just covers a *lot* of the units on that LS, including every unfused SSJ4. I thought about making this Goku a Battle of Wits leader, but I don't feel like a character with a typical Saiyan linkset should lead that team; I feel like an Earthling, android, or miscellaneous character would be a much better fit.\n\nSA effect, he raises his ATK and DEF by 30% for 4 turns because haha Super Saiyan **4.** Not only that, but it means that even as a floater, as long as you're getting him to SA, you can keep that 30% up. I didn't give him any additional effects because I feel like he already has so much utility in his passive, but for craps and giggles, with an Android 18 on the team, he becomes a stacker. Obviously, this is *VERY* strong, but it also requires you to actually run an Android 18 on the team with him lol. Even if his or the 17s' banner unit was a GT 18 from the final battle, she'd only be on a couple of his teams (Battle of Fate, GT Heroes, Battle of Wits, Bond of Parent and Child, Connected Hope, and maybe Final Trump Card), none of which he leads. So sure, with an 18 he becomes one of the best units in the game, but to be realistic, that won't happen too often, and if you DO get it on most of those teams than they would really need someone as good as SSJ4 Goku-with-an-18 anyway. I also gave him massive DEF lowering on his Unit SA because why not lol.\n\nNow, the meat of the card; his passive. It begins with him getting a 40% chance to dodge for 4 turns. (Note: His passive is littered with 4s. I thought it'd be neat.) This is because turn 1, he... isn't very impressive. A lot of his buffs come from finishing off an enemy in the same turn or from actually attacking/Super Attacking, but having that dodge chance means he wouldn't be completely dead in the water. Then, a somewhat high boost of 240%, followed by an ATK and DEF +40% multiplicative boost for 4 turns after attacking. This multiplicative boost means that with just those and the start of turn 240% active, he'd get a total ATK and DEF boost of 376%, even as a floater. This, combined with his SA effect, means that as long as you keep him SAing, he'll be able to keep his stats up; it's when you're *not* able to super with him when he can start to falter. Then, I wanted to try a new gimmick; *after* he attacks, all of his future attacks within the turn have a 40% chance of being crits, and he gets an additional 40% multiplicative buff. This is to resemble how after he fights 17 for a bit, he realizes that blasts don't work, and that allows him to fight more effectively. He also performs 2 additional normal attacks (that *cannot* be Super Attacks), which let him get even more damage racked up, as well as a 40% chance to do an additional Super. The ideal turn with this Goku is that you'd want to attack, get the two crit normals, then get the passive additional SA that ends up being a crit, and then do the HiPo additional SA that ends up being a crit; however, that's pretty heavily based on RNG.\n\nMoving on, Goku has even more utility based on Ki Spheres. He gets 40% ATK and DEF with 4 Ki Spheres obtained and another 40% ATK and DEF with a Rainbow Ki Sphere, but with 4 he also gives allies the same 40% ATK he gives himself and with a Rainbow Ki Sphere he gives all allies the same 40% DEF he gives himself. We all know that GT Heroes does ***not*** need another orb changer, so I didn't make him one, but that means if you're running him with any of the SSJ4s off of GT Heroes, he might be left to dry. Luckily, 4 orbs and 1 Rainbow isn't too harsh, but you definitely can get screwed over and/or have to make a choice.\n\nGoku foresees SAs after being knocked below 44% HP; it only applies to rotations he's on, but it's still valuable. This is based off of TEQ FPSSJ4 Goku's ability, and also (again) likening to Goku figuring out 17 during the fight. He also has the chance to dodge and counter SAs like most SSJ4s, but with a 50% chance and ferocious power. The neat thing about this is that is triggers the 40% ATK and crit chance buff after attacking part of his passive, so if you dodge an SA before, you can get the full benefits before actually SAing yourself.\n\nOne of the biggest parts of Goku's kits is that after an enemy is finished off within the same turn by him or an ally, he gets permanent guard, 40% ATK and DEF, and gives all allies 4 ki for the rest of battle. THIS is when he starts getting powerful. Prior to getting this buff, he'll be good, but he starts being a real powerhouse once you get this off. It's not perfect, however; for one, you're likely running him with other powerful teams, and you could very easily run into the issue similar to what INT SSJ3 Goku and TEQ MV do; if you're constantly finishing enemies off every other rotation that he's NOT on, getting his buff active can be inconsistent (and could even cost you in fights like Cell Max, where you really only have two chances to get it active). And then I gave him the 18 buff to incentivize running her. Sure, he becomes *busted* with an 18, but if you're running an 18 with him your team likely needs the help anyway.\n\nHis Active Skill is pretty simple, he does a strong attack, changes Rainbow Ki Spheres, and delays enemy's turn a la Pikkon, referencing the finishing blow dealt to Super 17. I tried to make the conditions fair because it is a pretty strong AS, along with allowing it turn 1 with an 18 (though frankly, because of how many buffs this Goku gets post-turn 1, I'm not sure you'd even *want* to use it that soon).\n\nFor links, I just gave him STR SSJ4 Goku's linkset. I was questioning giving him The Saiyan Lineage over Kamehameha, but I rewatched the fight and he does too many Kamehamehas to *not* have it. Then, he gets his categories, and that's that!\n\n**17 and HF 17 -> Super 17:**\n\nI was actually more excited about making this card than the Goku because I find Dokkan most fun when the Androids team is busted. I feel like when Android 13s are good, it's great because they have Android Assault to pair up with most androids and then BBB for Cells, and I wanted to emulate that with this card. Plus, the team really needs a slot 1 tank (TEQ Androids are good, but if the enemy isn't doing a Ki Blast SA I don't know about slot 1), so that's the mindset I was going in with. Plus, having a fusing 17s card is something I think most people wouldn't be upset by, and everyone knows Dokkan did TEQ S17 dirty, so this can be redemption!\n\nRelating to his LS, I wanted this card to basically be the ultimate Extreme Androids lead. Basically every relevant Extreme Android is under their LS, including the GT 17s and TEQ DBFZ 16, who are huge omissions from AGL Cell's lead. A flaw with this is that since the extra 30%s are Extreme-focused categories, basically no Super Androids get the full 200%, but they can still be run under the 170% so they'll do fine. GT Bosses has needed a leader as well, but it's not very strong, so I added Worldwide Chaos (*another* team that's needed a new leader) in there as an extra 170%. Several GT Bosses are in Inhuman Deeds, so a lot of them would get a 200% from that, which is good because not a lot of the main GT villains share links. From Worldwide Chaos, you also get Goku Blacks, Zamasus, and Buus, and I guess Kid Buu gets another team, even if he doesn't get the 200%.\n\nTalking about the 17 and 17 part of the card, their SA effect is pretty basic, a 30% ATK and DEF raises as well as a slight enemy debuff. With their passive, they get a 50% chance of launching an additional SA for 7 turns from their first appearance, and they also have a separate 50% chance of launching an additional SA after the first 7 turns. This means that for those 7 turns, they can quadruple SA, but since it's not worded as \"performs an additional attack that has a high chance to become a Super Attack\", you have to actually proc the additional SAs to proc your HiPo additional SA. This is because other than that, that's their main offensive utility; they get 170% ATK start of turn, 30% for their support, 70% with an Androids ally and then a multiplicative 70% when SAing, but they don't have counters, crit, or super effectiveness built into their passive. Regardless, they can still do great damage, but it's somewhat RNG dependent and not mind-numbingly high. They also give 2 Ki and 30% ATK/DEF to Androids and GT Bosses; Androids, so that the team flows smoothly even when you're running Cells on there, and GT Bosses so that the 17s actually *work* with them.\n\nHowever, the main purpose of this unit is to be a defensive menace. They get 200% DEF start of turn (170% + 30% support), but right off the bat they get 34% DR. (34 because 17 + 17, ha ha.) They get an additional 70% with an Androids ally as well, to reference the 17s working together as, well, androids. Then, as they attack or receive attacks they build up 70% DEF multiplicatively, and with an Androids ally not only do they get an additional 7% DR for a total of 41%, but they nullify Ki Blast SAs like the TEQ Androids. This means that once these two get running, they start *sprinting* defensively while still being a pretty good unit offensively. Just... don't use them without another android, and if you must, keep them floating until you can fuse (which I'll get into soon here).\n\nTheir linkset is pretty typical, they have the same linkset as the INT EZA HF #17. Super 17 has BBB once they fuse, but these two don\u2019t get it on their own, so maybe they could run into a similar issue as Buuhan when you don\u2019t get their fusion off early where their partners need BBB but they don\u2019t get it until later. Categories, basically every typical Super 17 category with Joined Forces included.\n\nThen comes the biggie; when HP is 34% or less, your entire team consists of Androids and GT Bosses, or starting from the 7th turn of battle, you can fuse in Super 17. As for the condition itself, I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s alright. On his own team, unless you want to run Buus and Goku Blacks/Zamasus, it\u2019s a really easy condition to fulfill, and in stages where you\u2019re taking lots of damage right off the bat, it\u2019s the kind of thing where if you get it under 34% HP, you probably needed it, since Androids doesn\u2019t have too much healing from meta-relevant characters nowadays. If you\u2019re running them on another team, chances are that you\u2019re just gonna have to wait until turn 7, and if you\u2019re running them without another android, then you\u2019re probably *floating* them until turn 7 because without another android, the 17s can be lacking.\n\nSuper 17 is meant to be the ace in the hole that finally gives the Androids team everything it needed while being a fitting leader for GT Bosses and Worldwide Chaos as well. For one, he gives a 70% heal when you fuse, which in most cases will be a full heal. Beginning with his SA effect, he massively raises ATK for 1 turn as well as greatly debuffing the enemy. You might think it\u2019s unfortunate that he doesn\u2019t raise DEF on SA, but believe me, he doesn\u2019t need it.\n\nImmediately after fusing, Super 17 gets 6 Ki, 170% ATK, 70% DEF, 3 Ki and 50% ATK and DEF for Androids and GT Bosses, and then a whopping \\*70% DR.\\* Then, after getting hit once, he gets a multiplicative 170% ATK and DEF buff for the rest of the fight. Obviously, he\u2019s a slot one unit, but as we can see nowadays, unless you get into the 90% and higher DR range, you're not a guaranteed tank, so he has plenty of defense as well. I feel like when you get this 17 out, he can completely change the scope of the fight; he's got a heal, he's a great tank, he's super effective with 70% or more HP... oh, and that's not even beginning to discuss the nullification and absorption. S17 absorbs all Ki Blast SAs and heals 70% of the damage he would take (much higher than 19 and 20's 39%, but he'll be taking a lot less damage from these SAs anyway so he's probably not healing THAT much) and he also has a 30% chance to nullify any other sort of SA. With this, it makes him an ideal slot 1 unit; even with dodge disabled, he can just give the enemy's SA the finger. \n\nHe also keeps his high additional SA chance that the 17 and 17 part has. I wanted to make him pretty good offensively (while obviously he can't be too strong), so that's why his heavy damage is more restrictive. On a turn where you're under 70% HP (very common) and don't get an additional SA (50% of the time), even with every link active, he does a 12 million ATK stat... but then that's it. His damage is also helped by the fact that he gets a 17% ATK buff every time an SA is absorbed, but that's not consistent at *all.*\n\nHe also has an enemy-manipulating AS where he puts all of the enemies' attacks into the spot right after he does, as well as getting a 17% ATK and DEF buff for 1 turn. This can be used whenever, and its utility would probably be most present in stages with multiple enemies, like SBR; not only does Super 17 already have good defensive abilities, but it doesn't matter how many of them are SAing in a turn if he goes and nullifies them all. Though he has this in his pocket, it's definitely not the kind of thing you use as soon as you can; wait for RNG to screw you over and for the boss to attack your fragile slot 3 character ten times, pop the AS, and then watch as Super 17 makes the boss' attacks look like child's play.\n\nFinally, his links. On the surface, it seems like a small change, just replacing 17 and 17's Brutal Beatdown with BBB. When you think about it, though, this can be *huge.* I think BBB, along with the card's support, means that Super 17 can be a really strong partner for Cells, even if they share very few links. Plus, on GT Bosses, BBB is a really important link, so that would be a massive bonus as well. I think that when you're running a non-BBB-Androids team, this Super 17 will still perform very well, but if you can get him running *with* BBB, then you're home free. And then, once we get an Android 13 EZA, those two would share 5 links, which would let them be a very powerful combo.\n\n**MVP 17 EZA:**\n\nI won't even try to deny it, I wanted to make this guy a slow-aging, god-tier support. He's on *so* many teams that need it, and I didn't want to hold back on him. The prominent features in his new passive is that he gets 30% DR start of turn and gives all allies an additional 7%. This, combined with his 42% DEF in links and start of turn DEF buff of 247% (170% start of turn and 77% to allies) means he could very easily be a slot 1 character if you think he can take the heat. His damage also skyrockets, getting 100% ATK start of turn and then an additional 170% when attacking. \n\nMVP 17 would get a lot stronger as his HP gets lower, as well. At 77% HP or below, he gets another 40% DR (for a total of 77%, ensuring his place as a tank) and all of his attacks are super effective. Then, two times with 50% or less HP, he gives all allies 60% ATK and himself 17% ATK, which is a reference to him blowing himself up in a near-suicidal move twice. Finally, with a USS category ally or an 18 on the team, he gets a high chance to launch an additional SA.\n\nWith this EZA, I think he could very well rival STR Cooler. He'd be the kind of card you throw onto any team; even with no links, as a floater on a 170% lead, he'd have around 360k DEF post-SA with 37% DR, which isn't including when his HP is 77% or less or the hypothetical double SA with requirements fulfilled. And with other Androids? 17 would *cook.*"

Let\u2019s say that the new Goku and Cooler continue this trend; what new busted category can you see them introducing? It\u2019s worth noting that you don\u2019t have to worry about making earlier categories irrelevant, because FF makes Fusion and a LOT of Potara irrelevant and PBSSJ makes SSJ2 and SSJ3 irrelevant.\n\nAs for me, a potential Cooler category would be obvious; just take Legends\u2019 Powerful Opponent tag and make it into a category, as that includes basically every main villain from King Piccolo to all major Z/GT/DBS/movie antagonists. At that point, it would be the best villain category in the game already, so the other LS wouldn\u2019t even matter too much, just widen the options for his team with something like Final Trump Card (which still needs a 170% team) and then the extra 30% can be for Transformation Boost. I could even see the not-new category on his LS being Target: Goku so you could run his Armored Squad with him.\n\nFor Goku, though? I\u2019m struggling to think of what strong new category he could introduce. Any thoughts?"

                "body": "Hi, I just finished the hiring process a few days ago (Sept. 2021) and wanted to provide some info for others because I also had questions and concerns and scoured the internet looking for information during the process. \n\n\nA bit of my background:\n\nI graduated less that a year ago, during the pandemic. I worked a co-op for 2.5 years during school and worked as an engineer over the past year, building my skills for a decent resume. \n\n\nInterview/Hiring Process:\n\nI applied very early September for a mid-level engineering position. A recruiter reviewed my resume and reached out the next day via email to schedule a phone screening for the following week. \n\nDuring the 25 minute phone screening, we briefly discussed some of my resume items like locations and dates. I was asked to describe my current company and why I was interested in GM. We talked salary and relocation allowance (which I wasn't eligible for; this was based on the distance from my current work address- not from my home address). We also talked pay and benefits. I was asked to name a number, which I did. \n\nAt the end of the phone screen, the recruiter explained the next step would be a HireVue, which is a video recording of myself answering three technical questions. I had two business days to complete the HireVue. \n\nWhen I signed into HireVue, there was a button labeled something to the effect of \"Begin\" or \"Start\". Here, you have the chance to practice as many recordings as you would like. I would recommend practicing because you can adjust your lighting or make sure your background looks decent, also the practice questions are very similar to the style of questions given in the recorded session and the final interview. \n\nDuring the HireVue, you have two attempts for each question. After your first attempt, you can replay the video and pause/skip around within the video. I used my replay time to make notes so that my next attempt would be better. \n\nI didn't know what one of the questions was asking, so I quickly Goggled the technical term and still answered incorrectly. Luckily I was still invited to the final round of interviews. \n\nAbout three days after the HireVue, I was invited for the final interview via email. There were three time slots available for three interviewees. It sounded like the recruiter would have tried to work out a different time if they hadn't work for me. \n\nI spent a lot of time prepping for the interview. I used [GlassDoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/General-Motors-GM-Interview-Questions-E279.htm), as the information there is plentiful. The questions listed there helped tremendously and there is a review from June 25, 2021 that describes the status terms within WorkDay and what they mean. My status followed that description for the entire process. \n\nThe hiring manager called me first thing the next morning to offer me the job. This was followed by a document via email that listed the salary and other benefits (they gave me the salary I asked for- yay!). I accepted the offer later that same night.\n\nNext, was the background check. The last hurdle to securing the job. I filled the information in as best as I could. After five business days, I contacted the company through the chat option in the website and it turned out they needed one more piece of information. I sent that over via email and the background check was completed the following day. I had one item flagged for review, a misdemeanor from my teen years when I failed a sting operation and sold cigarettes to a minor. About a half hour after I got notification of the background check completion, the recruiter called to tell me it was safe to turn in my two week notice. This entire process, from application to final approval took 28 calendar days. \n\nI hope this helps anyone who is stressed during their interview or hiring process. Please feel free to ask any question you may have. I'm an open book.\n\nEdited to add: I am just speaking based on my own experience. You will find a lot of other experiences from this subreddit and the link I provided.\n\nAnd: no drug test, even though I will be driving vehicles as part of my job."

For the specifications of which option I chose, I got the T10 steel katana and tanto.\n\nNow, I bought this because I'm a fan of Ghost of Tsushima, and regardless of its quality I'm going to display it in my room.\n\nHowever, I'm a first time katana buyer and was just wondering if any of you think these are good quality? It says it had a full tang and is sharpened, as you can probably see. And the reviews for both the item itself and the seller overall seem to indicate it it very popular and good quality. But form what I've researched it seems to be on the cheaper side of blades available? \n\nI just wanna know if I can cut some inanimate objects up or if it won't easily break, so if any of you could help that would be appreciated!!"

Which I sadly took offence to because in my experience when people say that it's typically meant as a bad thing. That I'm overly sensitive, dramatic, materialistic, weak, uncapable, irrational, etc.\n\nI've always been the class clown and haven't been afraid of standing up for classmates. I've never been perticularly afraid of conflicts if they seemed necessary. I obviously talk a lot. I'm sensitive in nature and emotional. I burp and fart a lot and joke about disgusting stuff. I love to dressup, I care about looking cute, I care about our home feeling homely and I like to decorate it. But I Also can't be bothered to do my makeup or nails everyday. I Would never wakeup extra early to do these things everyday. I'm always on top of buying food and other things we need for our home. I love to be creative and to watch korean dramas because of the romance. I Also listen to metall and kpop. I like to build things and to fix stuff around the house. I'm a bit of a casual gamer, love board games, magic the gathering and getting into warhammer. I'm messy in all aspects of life, I like to have it nice and structured but ya know it has been a struggle for sure. \n\nI don't feel like I'm more girly than masculine but like everyone else, it seems like, in The comment section I've been labeled as one because of me not being passive and me not being on time, having a nice handwriting or a nestly kept schooldesk. I think. Because I can be very girly, I guess mowadays I feel more girly than manly but that's only because I used to feel embarrased about my girlier sides. Felt like I was treated like I'm \"cooler\" than that by family and people at school. It's not \"cool\" to be girly. Idk what it's like for kids nowadays but yeah that might be more of a \"me-thing\" rather than a Adhd-thing.",

A lot of them are against putting clothes on animals, which I agree with if there's no practical reason for it. \n\nI had thought it through myself and since I've seen some iggys live in similar places and not seem bothered by having to put on coats and shoes I thought that it would be ok. As long as it's not making them feel bad, you know.\n \nOne of my friends who's been more vocal about it than others have to put coats and jackets on one of her rescue dogs around -10\u00b0c, it's actually one of the reasons I've thought that it would work out fine since it does with her dog. I realise that I'd have to dress an IG much sooner than -10\u00b0c which is why she thinks it's not ok.\n\nI could just get a breed that's more fit for our winters but then again I do think that an IG would be a great fit for me and my S.O. I've thought of a whippet or a greyhound as well, they both need clothes but can probably handle a little more. But they seem to be quite different compared with an iggy, personality vice.\n\nI know that I'm being selfish but I wanted to get your guy's thought's and opinions to determine exactly how selfish and bad it is.

Remember that I won't be producing to make money, it's just a hobby but I guess I eventually might sell one or two things at a flea market for fun.\n\nMy other question is to those who uses or used to have a analog kiln, did you leave it on during the night or is that too unsafe in your opinion? How annoying do you find it to have to keep track on it? Would you suggest a perticular analog kiln?"

Today at work it was all I could think about. I was really upset and people around me noticed.\n\nHowever, after several hours of processing and a good conversation (not related to 177013), I managed to find some good lessons in it - the biggest one being to always be grateful for what I have. There is always a pathway that I could go down where I lose everything. Another one being that honesty and innocence are not going to protect you against people's worst impulses. \n\nIt has to be one of the most tragic stories I've ever read. That being said, we can learn a lot from tragedies, and use them as a guide to navigate really bad situations - or at least think about them more seriously.\n\nIn the short term, definitely regretting it.",

                "body": "A big thank you to this community for all the tips, information and resources that helped my pass my PMP exam today (Dec 7) with 3xATs!!\n\nI started my PMP in August but picked it up seriously only in September.  I started with Joseph Philips course on Udemy but switched to AR's Udemy course. AR's course worked me  and I enjoyed his style of teaching. I took detailed notes throughout his course and reviewed the topics I got wrong in the end of section quizzes. Reviewed 200 questions by David McLachlan, paused the video each time to figure out the answer and then resumed to see what the answer and its reasoning was. I studied about 8-10 hours every week. Got most of studies done during the weekends. Did not read PMBOK edition 6, 7 or the Agile Practice Guide. For mocks and practice questions, I used TIA exam simulator and Study Hall Essentials. I truly enjoyed working through Study Hall and was taking the practice questions and games even during my commutes. Also reviewed lot of posts in this community and revisited them before my exam\n\n**Resources Used:**\n\n1.

Notes that I took for myself throughout my studies.\n\n**Mock Tests Results:**\n\n* **TIA -**\n\n[TIA Mock Scores](https://preview.redd.it/ebzprejtvk4a1.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d90c949be0b2166884d13d11dd7f624170953b3d)\n\n* **Study Hall scores -**\n\n[Study Hall Scores](https://preview.redd.it/23jo78hxvk4a1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8918e06bb46281d06f9db1707e6ff64f9e045ff2)\n\n**Exam:**\n\nAs mentioned by many previously, the actual exam felt somewhere between TIA and SH. Some questions had a straight forward answer while other felt very convoluted. Exam fatigue is a real thing and I had to keep myself motivated and focused throughout the exam. Section 1 was more difficult than the other 2 sections. Having said that, there definitely were some tricky questions in section 2 & 3.  No calculations, no EVM questions, 2 drag and drop questions. Most questions were situational. 70% agile+hybrid, 30% predictive. I reviewed the flagged questions before submitting each section, changed couple of answers after review.  Wore blue!!\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1. Mindset is key. As everyone here is mentioned, MINDSET IS KEY, cannot stress this enough. It might not help you identify the right answer right away, but it will give a framework for how to get to the right answer.\n2. Time Management on the exam is very important. The exam timer counts the time down from 230 to 0. As per  [AR's time management video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNg1iyGAmaw), ideally each section should be done in 75 mins. I  planned to complete section 1 by the time counts down to 155, section 2 to 70 and section 3 to 0. I took about 80-85 mins for Section 1, caught up during section 2 and finished exam 4 mins early. Take the 2 breaks, eat something, freshen up in the breaks, change your environment.\n3. When reviewing the flagged questions, I changed the answers only if I was sure that some other answer was the right answer. If you are unsure, as AR says give it your best shot and come back to it later. Kept this in mind, as I found myself spending almost 2-3 mins on some questions.\n4. Give as many mocks and practice questions as you can. Practice is very important. But take a call when to stop. For me I stopped doing practice exams/ questions 3 days before my exam and spent rest of the time revising my notes and reviewed AR's Mindset video **multiple** times.\n5. During studies and preparation, I found myself losing focus at times. It happens sometimes and is okay. Be kind to yourself. Just pick it up again where you left and keep working through it. There will come a time when you will find a steady pace, maintain this pace.\n6. Acknowledge that this exam needs hard work and dedicated studying. Be prepared to put in the efforts, they will pay off!\n\nThanks again to this community and all the best to the test takes! **YOU GOT THIS!!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: fixed typos.\n\nEdit 2: fixed more typos! :D"

It's more energy dense than uranium (50 to 100\u00d7 more energy can be claimed from thorium) it doesnt require closed mining, its insanely abundant. We have enough in reserves, 3rd in the world India is first, to power the world per capita at the same level the united states uses energy (with calculated energy increases) until the year 3000 +,-. And that's what we dug up half a century ago and the government told us it was a stupid idea to use and forbade further development and used uranium/plutonium instead. It has low viability for making atomic weapons, its safer to use (doesnt have meltdowns essentially), its byproducts are clean air (oxygen, hydrogen, and other halogens), medicinal isotopes used in chemotherapy, and distilled water. Its other byproduct, spent thorium, can be re used, and when it's done being used is only radioactive for 500 years not 10,000+ like current radioactive energy means (i.e. plutonium and uranium). It isnt used for 2 reasons globally. 1) oil, gas, coal, uranium and other big money businesses that supply power sources would become essentially obsolete (greed driven). And 2) because it would cost a good chunk of change (not much more than uranium plants did adjusting for current prices and production) messing up the status quo. It has its cons, as everything does (it's hard to restart the thorium energy process but we know little about it compared to our knowledge of uranium, but do know it's better by alot) but it's something the world needs and NOW.",

We met up after the break and she said she wanted to try again, kinda start from square one and \"date\" each other again. However, two days later, she'd changed her mind and she broke up with me. In the turbulent times leading up to all of this, the dynamics in our relationship made her anxious. Leading up to the break and during it, I focused basically *all* of my energy on killing those dynamics and being the partner she deserved. I never got a chance after the break to show her that. But she said that in the two days after we talked and agreed to try again, all of that anxiety from before resurfaced (even though we weren't even around each other or anything) and she listened it and honored it and let me know that she couldn't be with me right now. She said that she still loved me so much and would always care about me and hoped that we could still be in each other's lives. Although right now, we are not in contact, as part of our individual healing processes.\n\nI do still see her a couple times a week at yoga class and at church and it is very triggering, but I hope/believe it will fade in time.\n\nThe hardest thing for me has been accepting that this person who previously wanted to spend her whole life with me has ultimately chosen otherwise. I was more devoted to her than I can put into words. But I've just been telling myself that she must not have been meant to be my forever person after all. We must have served the purposes that we were supposed to in each other's lives and now it's time to move on. Maybe opposites don't attract as much as I thought they did.\n\nI'm well.

                "body": "I'm 24. I was with my girlfriend for two years. We lived together for 1.5. I believed with every fiber in my being that it was forever. I'd never felt so close to a person in my entire life. It was everything I've ever wanted. She was my best friend and I admired her more than anyone in the world. It was definitely an opposites-attract situation and I believed it to be ideal--any quality one of us didn't possess, the other did. As a couple, we were the complete package. I felt fully myself, fully known, seen, and loved for exactly who I was. We purchased engagement rings and planned to be engaged soon. But around that time, in what ended up being the final six months of the relationship, things unraveled. Bad cycles. Detrimental codependency. Angry outbursts on my end, hurt feelings on hers. Wounds going unhealed. Sacrificing ourselves for each other. Until a point where we'd clearly grown apart and clearly weren't as happy as we used to be. Which sucks because we still loved each other wholeheartedly. But she said the relationship didn't feel healthy for her anymore. We moved out and took a break. After the break, she said she wanted to try again. Two days later, she'd changed her mind--said she couldn't do it right now. This was two weeks ago, so the actual breakup is quite new, but I've been in the process of mourning what the relationship was for about 3 months now. It's just in the past two weeks though that I've stopped hoping for a future. \n\nI was all in with this relationship. Its end was not my decision in any way, shape, or form. I think I would have stood by her side no matter how hard things got (not saying that's necessarily a good thing). But she was my everything. So how do I shift away from that? \n\nI am not proud of the way I behaved in every moment of the relationship. Without my actions, we wouldn't be where we are today. However, I'm a determinist, philosophically, so at this point, I don't think the relationship was meant for us after all, because if it was, we wouldn't be where we are today. But anyway, I am proud of myself in these past couple of months. I have really tried to work on myself and be healthy. I've been cooking, exercising, reading, practicing my instruments, spending time with friends and family, etc. I have not engaged in any unhealthy coping mechanisms. I have not sought attention or validation to make myself feel better. I'm really trying to do it all right. I'm really trying to honor myself, honor my ex, and honor the beautiful relationship we shared. I will move on and look for something new in time, as I know that love and companionship are very important to me, but I'm not in a hurry like I imagine previous versions of myself would have been.\n\nDespite giving all my best efforts to being healthy and happy lately though, of course I am still very sad. I'm doing everything I can, but of course these things just take time. Things that normally feel really good in life just feel okay right now. Experientially, everything is just knocked down a few pegs. My light is a bit dulled right now.\n\nWhat advice do you have for me during this period? How do I learn to love life again? How do I learn to accept that she was not my forever, but an invaluable period of my life? How can I be my best self at this time? How should I approach love differently in the future?\n\nAny and all advice is welcome--even personal anecdotes, media you wish to direct me towards, other subreddits, etc. etc. etc. I'm just trying to get my light back, make peace with the hardest loss I've experienced, and try to stop dwelling on it all so much.\n\nMuch love to you guys. <3"

In the last couple months, we decided (well she did, but I obliged) to take a step back in our relationship, to take a break, and assess things. I recently realized I have Borderline Personality Disorder which is a helpful explanation for a lot of the things I've done wrong in the relationship, as well as a helpful guide as far as the things I need to work on. She was raised by a narcissistic mother, with whom she was codependent, and she realized that the same patterns were playing out in our relationship. This is the reason for the separation--we can not be in a healthy relationship as long as these unhealthy behaviors are present. We are still in love with each other, but we each have some serious self-work to do.\n\nWe moved into separate apartments this past weekend and we are now on a one-month-long, no-contact break. We are still in a relationship; we are not seeing other people, but there is no telling what happens at the end of the month--whether we will break up or try to create a new, improved iteration of our relationship. Initially, this absolutely tore me up inside. I recently spent a month at my absolute rock bottom over this. My view of the world and the rest of my life was shaped by my understanding that we would be by each other's sides no matter what. We even have engagement rings purchased. So this shook me to my core. \n\nBefore moving out, I was trying desperately every chance I got to show her what a good partner I could be and how beautiful our love was. I was trying desperately to convince her to be with me after the break. But sometime in the last week, I surrendered control and handed it over to the universe. I hope and I believe that the break will bring us the clarity we need. If she really is my soulmate like I have believed, she will miss me and want to be with me again. If she doesn't want that, it isn't meant to be. Even as I type this, I can't tell if I actually believe it or if I'm trying to convince myself. It will crush me if she doesn't want to be with me. The thought of being rejected by the person who once wanted to spend her whole life with me is gut-wrenching. I hope she will want to. I hope to create a new, better relationship with her. But I will be okay no matter what.\n\nI intend to use this month to find myself again. I am living alone for the very first time. I never necessarily felt like I lost myself during the relationship, but my inner voice was definitely her sometimes. So I want to know me--the real me, the healthy me. I will not resort back to any unhealthy coping mechanisms from my past. I will live in alignment with my moral compass. I will live authentically. I will explore myself. I will never do anything that she would not approve of, as I love and respect her so much and we are still in a relationship, even if we are not currently in contact. \n\nDo you have any advice for me? For becoming comfortable with solitude, as an extrovert and someone who has always relied heavily on others to feel okay? For getting in touch with myself, knowing myself, and understanding myself? For preparing myself to be okay with either outcome--simultaneously preparing myself to be a much better partner to her than ever before, and preparing myself to lose her and acknowledge that I will have to reconfigure my life plans?\n\nTL;DR: My partner and I are taking a one-month, no-contact break as a result of acknowledging unhealthy patterns in our relationship, and after the month, we will assess whether or not we will move forward as a couple. What advice do you have for me regarding the questions in the paragraph above?\n\nMuch love. <3"

I'm still a student so I don't know much tbh, and I could be completely wrong so please educate me if I am.\n\nMy career goals are to achieve mastery or expertise in something, and I'm not sure if design is even an expert field at this point. Design principles are sort of universally established and it feels like there's not a lot of room for intellectual growth in the field of design. I think the only thing that separates a high level designer from a low level designer is the industry experience, not skill because the skill ceiling imo is pretty low. Design thinking is also pretty overrated imo because it's not something unique to designers that they've learned through years of skill building, but it's easily adoptable by people of any profession, be it development, engineering, cybersecurity etc. In fact, design is an integral part of a lot of technical professions and everyone has to have a basic understanding of design. But here's the question, if everyone knows design, why do you need a designer specifically?\n\nI am confused about my individual worth as a designer, in what ways am I different from other designers? In what ways can I be considered better or worse at design except industry experience? I know that designers in general are valuable to companies, but I'd like to know how one designer can be different from another.\n\nAlso, I'm not interested in Visual design. It seems pretty insignificant to me, as I'd like to individually contribute to the inventions and discoveries of new products, not just clean up and make things look pretty after programmers do the heavy lifting."

I fell in love because she was my first \"person\" and it was just an unreal feeling to share yourself with someone else. We separated because she had to move to a different city, but we still remain very close to each other. My recent experience has made me ask a lot of questions about \"love\" which I'm not able to answer and it's left me in a confused spot. I don't know what to do.\n\nThe feeling of having her around was incredible, and everything just seemed perfect. My heart wants to make this feeling last forever. I have this inner romanticism, as I seek a singular partner with whom I can have great memories and find meaning with. I want to have this one extremely special person by my side who I can live my dreams with. That dream is something I really look forward to and finding that extremely special person is something I really value.\n\nHowever, here is what I fear.\n\nIs this romantic idealism something to be preserved? Is it something everybody has to get over because everybody becomes attached to the first person they are intimate with? I often get told how unrealistic these ideals are, and that they're just something to get over with, so you can focus on more important things like your career. My partner and all of my friends that have experienced intimacy multiple times have the same take, and I see why it makes sense. Because they've conditioned themselves to it by getting it over with so they don't have to put their energy into relationships. They're the same type of people that engage in hookup culture, because it's easy and you don't have to take your attention off of your goals. I totally see why it makes sense.\n\nBut I don't know if that's something that is only suited to them or if that is something that happens to everyone after a point. \n\nLiving by my ideals and continuing to seek \"the one\" might be very painful because of how unpredictable dating culture is nowadays. And perhaps it is rational advice to overcome these and maybe \"grow up\" because these are irrational troubles that will just slow your life down.\n\nBut I don't know, man. I derive a huge sense of meaning from this romanticism that I have within me. Will I just overcome this after a while and see the world like people tell me after a while?\n\nTLDR; 20M Conflicted about love, need some advice from those that are experienced."

Before my next turn the group destroyed my equiptment and I really didnt get another opportunity to bring out Cadira and hit faces. \n\nI was told if I had brought Cadira out first and then the equiptment I would have had the chance to at least use her once. I was wondering if anyone else had any words of wisdom for a newbie whos making misplay mistakes like that. \n\nTrying to learn better plays but its hard in the moment. \n\nThanks!"

The reason I am indecisive between the two is that I am already 2 years into MechE, and I am applying to transfer to another University this year, so it would be very tough to change the major completely as it will have different course requirements for transfer. Would it be a good idea to stick to MechE and then maybe switch to Software Engineering after I transfer, or switch to Software right now, or just stick with MechE the whole way? I have a friend who really convinced me to switch to Software, their base salary is mindblowing, and the amount of work and prereqs for Software is not as hefty as MechE. I also think Software is great for job outlook and future growth because of advancements in technology. With that being said, I do enjoy Mechanical Engineering because I had fun with kinematics and building stuff in Physics class.  What are some suggestions you guys have? Thanks so much!!!"

I think he\u2019s a great character with a lot of depth, and he\u2019s the one that basically unearthed the entire conspiracy anyways, so I was thinking\u2014why don\u2019t we make a mod or another separate game with Paul as the main character? It could start as a flashback from the time that MJ12 staged the car crash that was meant to kill him and his parents, except that he survived, of course, and the game could begin at the UNATCO academy, where you could have like a training session for the game itself. Cutscene to your graduation. Then, you\u2019d start your first missions from UNATCO against NSF terrorists. Fast-forward a couple of missions (and years in-game), there\u2019s a cutscene in which you get selected for nanoaugmentations, which you agree to. At this point, the player can use the augs. With every mission, and Paul lurking around, he starts noticing that something isn\u2019t right. He eventually gets shipped to Hong Kong to terminate the Luminous Path Triad leader, Gordon Quick. There, he meets Maggie Chow (an MJ12 operative) who claims to side with the Red Arrow, and then helps them steal the sword components (or however it is that the whole incident happened) because he is told by UNATCO that the Luminous Path is evil. However, the more he learns, the more he realizes that things aren\u2019t adding up, and when he attacks the Luminous Path compound, he meets Tracer Tong, who reveals the truth about his role in Bob Page\u2019s master plan. Anyways, he also meets Lebedev and starts siding with the NSF back in North America. The latter bit of the game will have Manderley and Simons being suspicious about his activity and his inability to carry out the assassination attempt. Paul will have to resort to work as a double agent if he wants to survive ... for now. The last cutscene would be Paul waiting by the south dock, watching a police speedboat approaching (the one that will drop off JC for his first day) which will ultimately begin the events of Deus Ex!"

                "body": "There\u2019s been debate of JC being either an INTJ or INTP, which is reasonable given that he\u2019s pretty intuitive, introverted, skeptical, witty, and intelligent. However, INTJ uses Ni-Te-Fi-Se, while INTP uses Ti-Ne-Si-Fe. I\u2019m more inclined to believe that JC is an INTJ, because he had a very good Ni and his lines tend to be very Ni-oriented (as is the whole game). However, JC is such a malleable character that your choices will affect his personality and the lines he says. Anyways, here\u2019s Mrs. Denton\u2019s MBTI list for Deus Ex:\n\nJC Denton: *INTx - Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, but whether Perceiving or Judging is up for debate.*\n\nPaul Denton: ENFJ - *Demonstrates strong use of Fe and Ni. Is strong, passionate, direct, and extroverted, however, he can see the underlying patterns beneath everything.*\n\nAnna Navarre: ISTP - *Your typical no-bullshit, kinesthetically-gifted, unemotional badass.*\n\nGunther Hermann: xSTx - *I have a bit of trouble typing Gunther because we don\u2019t see too much of him in the game. But he\u2019s definitely a sensor and a thinker because of his love for shooting things. He can be a bit emotional at times, but he\u2019s usually collected.*\n\nJoseph Manderley: ESTJ - *Typical boss type. Turned on by rules and regulations. Will make sure you act like a professional. Can make you sign anything.*\n\nJaime Reyes: ISFJ - *Caring, dependable, and lowkey sassy. Remembers every single detail about the neurons\u2014and just about everywhere\u2014in your nanoaugmented body.*\n\nAlex Jacobson: INTP - *Typical geek. Was probably a child prodigy. Graduated with multiple Ph.Ds in computer science, network systems, and communications engineering by the time he was 20.*\n\nSandra Renton: ESTP - *Is not particularly interested in the feelings of her father (or yours, for your information). Rebellious and adventurous, always seeking a fresh start regardless of anybody else\u2019s opinions.*\n\nSmuggler: INTP - *Whacked-out paranoid, but there\u2019s a method to the madness. Knows shit you probably don\u2019t.*\n\nNicolette DuClare: INFJ - *Rebel with a cause. Likes supporting causes in the shadows. Understands how society works.*\n\nMorgan Everett: INTJ - *Hustles behind the scenes so his wetdream of being the world\u2019s puppet master comes into fruition someday. Sees and opportunity and seizes it. High IQ.*\n\nStanton Dowd: INTJ - *Morgan Everett\u2019s buddy. Seems nice but is also scheming to control the world.*\n\nTracer Tong: INTP - *Genius IQ. A cybertech rogue. Developed a method to a problem nobody knew could be solved for certain.*\n\nMaggie Chow: ESFJ - *Fame, fortune, and riches. Stays fabulous. Her wardrobe is worth more than your entire yearly income.*\n\nWalton Simons: ESTJ - *Bob Page\u2019s enforcer. Kink? People keeping their nose to the pavement. Is nice enough if you do things his way.*\n\nBob Page: ENTJ - *The supreme megalomaniac. Believes himself a god. Lowkey a nerd.*\n\nLeave your comments and thoughts below!"

My plan is to wait for her to forgive me or shell just overlook it if I give her some time. \nFor clarification why she couldnt go: its because nobody could pick us up after the concert and our last option was going by train, but Lucy cant afford that and wont let me pay for her ride, because she would have a bad conscience. So thats probably why she reacted that emotional. \n She wanted to sell the tickets, so nobody of us can go. However I just found someone to pick us up from the concert so Lucy and I will probably go together, but it will be awkward af. \nI didnt add that to my original post because of the character limit, but maybe that makes her actions more understandable.",

                "body": "me (m16) and my best friend \"Lucy\" (f17) have been planing to go to a concert together. But three days ago Lucy texted me that she cant go to the concert and I can go by myself.\nI was really shocked by that because she was the one who bought the tickets and was also really excited for the concert.\nI didnt know what to do since the concert was only a week away and I had been really exited to go with Lucy. \nI went to smoke a cigarette and think of my options. Then I texted her, that I would buy the tickets from her and go with someone else. \nThis is were I made a mistake. For me it was the logical thing to do in that moment, but that doesnt change that I didnt consider Lucys emotions. We often have problems in our relationship because of Lucys fear of being replaced. And I should have had thought of that before I texted that. But it was too late. Lucy was really pissed. She asked me how I could even think of replacing her, since I knew how exited she was for the concert and that she would never ever replace me and on and on and on she went. \nI instantly apologized in a voice message, but also told her that we should talk again the next day because she seemed really emotional. But she told me her emotions wouldnt just vanish because it was another day. At that point I didnt really know what to do since I already apologized. \nFast forward to two days later (today). Lucy told me she was still mad at me and that I shouldnt have just pretended like nothing happend (the last two days I just texted her like I normally would) and should have properly apologized. So I apologized again, but she told me the apology didnt change a thing since my tone of voice (I made a voice message) wasnt genuine (I was really pissed at her for saying that, because I have autism and she always reads something into my words what just isnt there) and it was too late now since the damage is already done. \nI then went on to explain to Lucy why I wrote that, because I thought if she understood then she could easier forgive me. But she took that as me trying to find excuses for my \"asshole move\". I asked her how not wanting to go to a concert alone/ not going at all was being an asshole and that all my friends would have done the same (I talked to them for advice). She told me my friends are also assholes and that her friends would never do that to her. \nSo I told her that if it was me who couldnt go to the concert I wouldnt have a problem with her going with someone else. (Wasnt the best move in retrospect) To that she said I was trying to manipulate her and tell her she was overreacting. (Which wasnt my intention at all). After that I gave up and told her I wouldnt talk to her about that topic anymore.\nHow can I fix this? AITA?? \n\nTLDR: bff \"Lucy\" couldnt go to a concert (she planned to go to for months) with me so I wanted to go with someone else. Now shes mad and wont take my apology."

I set up a meeting with my academic advisor through FOL for last Friday, but I never got a zoom link or a call. 10 minutes into my meeting time, I emailed my academic advisor to ask him about the link but he hasn't replied since. I understand he may be busy since it's the beginning of the school year, and probably has thousands of students emailing him, so I don't blame him. But I am just worried because I would like to drop out of these courses now so I do not have to feel obligated to do the work, so I am able to concentrate on my other courses. I am going to email him again today asking if he can drop the courses, but he he doesn't reply what should I do? Is there someone else I can talk to? would it be better to email him on Monday since it's the weekend? and should I email my professors telling them my situation and that I may not complete work?"

I\u2019ve shared and reformatted the color pie resources from our wonderful discord, so feel free to [check that out](https://www.reddit.com/r/colorpie/comments/wdahjy/pie_resources/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n2. I\u2019ve added some more flairs and made them mandatory in settings. If anything is unclear or you feel some other flairs would be useful, don\u2019t hesitate to mention it.\n3. Test results now have to be included in a larger trial rather than as a standalone post. For a while the sub was only test results and they didn\u2019t tend to get a lot of interest from the community, so I figured I\u2019d make a rule change.\n4. This isn\u2019t an actual rule change yet, but people have suggested making a mega thread for trials rather than having them clutter the sub, but this would obviously be a bigger change so I\u2019d love some community input on the idea.\n\nNow for the fun part, the contest. To encourage some activity for the community, I plan on posting a topic at the start of every month. At the end of the month, the post with the most upvotes will be declared the winner and the poster will get to choose a special flair for themselves. This is less about winning though and more about making content as a community, so all the other posts will of course be linked as well. To mark your post as a part of the contest, you simply use the contest flair on the post. I\u2019ll then announce the next post and I\u2019ll rinse and repeat with a new topic, assuming this goes well.\n\nFor our first month, I\u2019ll keep it simple. Write about your colors. This can be a write up on how you relate to your colors and the journey that led up to them, an introduction to your combination, a sales pitch to other users, or anything in between. Quality always comes before strict adherence to the topic, so you have a lot of leeway here. Feel free to ask questions, as always, and good luck!"

I apologize if this turns into a ramble, just want to lay everything out to see what you guys think! Feel free to answer anything that sticks out to you. TIA!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStats: 16M, 5'3.5\", 127 lbs??, 9.3%BF??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent Exercise:\n\nM: 3 hrs gymnastics, track practice at school\n\nT: track practice at school (lifting day)\n\nW: track practice at school, 2 hr pole vault practice at a club facility \n\nTh: 3 hrs gymnastics, track practice at school (lifting day)\n\nF: 3 hrs gymnastics, track practice at school\n\nS: 3 hrs gymnastics\n\nSun: pole vault practice if I don't go Wednesday, if not then just a rest day\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiet: No prominent concerns, I crush the protein macro goal (well over 1g/lb) and am always a little over the fat macro goal (.3g/lb). I take a multivitamin, fish oil pill (won't eat fish lol), MusclePharm Assault before lifting and pole vaulting, usually at least a scoop of whey incorporated some time throughout the day, and I'm very diligent with tracking cals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackstory: \n\nDue to less activity during quarantine, I weighed roughly 142 in May, and as I returned to gymnastics this gradually decreased. In July, I was ill for a week with no appetite, and lost about 5 pounds from not eating-- I noticed that I suddenly looked more cut (probs just lack of water weight also), and I decided to become more invested in my fitness and nutrition to hopefully see some more muscle definition. I started reading up on here and r/fitness about exercise and nutrition and made some lifestyle changes and began cutting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think my TDEE is 2300 assuming that I classify as \"moderate activity\" (ik these calculators aren't entirely accurate but I like them as a starting point). Over summer, I was only doing pole vaulting and gymnastics (some running and conditioning on my own but not through school track), so I considered myself light activity. I ate average 1700 cals daily (some days wayyy less) and always hit macros. As school started and I began to incorporate track again, I brought my calorie intake up to anywhere from 1900-2200 daily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking back, I realize that I was not eating enough and my lowest weight since I started was 125.4lbs (almost 17 lbs less than I started). I weighed 125 last week eating at about 1800 cals (I got quarantined and have been less active) and was dehydrated and probably low on glycogen, but still this feels like a lot of weight lost in too little time considering I wasn't particularly overweight to begin with. This week with eating at 2000 I've weighed roughly 127 which seems accurate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, even being this light, I am not seeing that much of a difference. Could I actually be skinny fat? I really didn't think so considering the emphasis that gymnastics and track place on physical strength, but the lack of definition at 9% (via Navy calculation) is surprising to me. Granted, this could be just my own perception (or even due to my stocky body type), but I feel like I should appear more defined if I'm actually 9%. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to feel too skinny now, because I no longer fit nicely into a singlet and I haven't been able to bend my heavier poles at pole vault. This has me thinking it's time for a bulk, but I'm still hesitant. Is it even feasible for me to gain muscle only lifting 2x a week in contrast to the amount of \"cardio\" I'm doing? I don't consider gymnastics and pole vault terribly cardio intensive because it's better to take good turns and rest than burn out and be dangerous, but sports plus running at track is certainly causing a decent calorie burn. How much of a surplus would you recommend to avoid putting the fat I lost back on? I know you can't prevent it entirely, but since the fat was only recently lost, I fear that it will very quickly be put back on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask me any other questions if I missed something important. I'm excited to hear everyones advice and thanks again!"

You can say \u201cI don\u2019t want to link his nazi rubbish to bipolar,\u201d but that is extremely reductionistic. I know we don\u2019t want to acknowledge this, but mental illness is gritty. It distorts people more than we want to admit. \n\nOne of the symptoms of bipolar is delusion and another is psychosis. The majority of people with bipolar do not experience either. I experience them regularly. I lose control of my actions and beliefs. It doesn\u2019t always matter how medicated I am. I\u2019ve been delusional to the point where I couldn\u2019t even communicate normally. I had hallucinations that shadow people were trying to kill me. All of these have occurred while medicated in intensive outpatient therapy, or even in the hospital. \n\nTo say that Kanye is somehow responsible if this is a result of his mental illness is really harmful. It\u2019s equally harmful to arbitrarily state that YOU don\u2019t want to link it. If you truly want to advocate for mental health, you must acknowledge the ugly symptoms, too. You cannot push away those of us with more severe symptoms because you don\u2019t like the sight of them.\n\nIs it really that impossible for someone to experience delusions that make them susceptible to conspiracy theories? Clearly not, considering a very large amount of those with psychosis or delusions but into conspiracy theories. I have myself as a result of my delusions. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know what that feels like, you\u2019re privileged even in your disorder. It\u2019s terrifying and you lose any sense of self. Coming out of it is like returning the blood flow to your arm after you\u2019ve been cutting off circulation to it for a long time. \n\nWe cannot pretend like Kanye is the only person with bipolar experiencing the disorder in this way. While I\u2019ve never believed anything outright hateful, it is my worst fear. I don\u2019t have control over my delusions. I don\u2019t know when the next one will be. I can try to manage it but the risk is always there. I don\u2019t like Kanye. I\u2019m not a fan, I never really cared about him. But Kanye has the same disorder as me, so when you speak on his symptoms, it makes me worried for the possibility that one day I could end up like that against my will.\n\nI don\u2019t care if Kanye is acting this way as a result of his symptoms. That is for him and his doctors to worry about. I care that the rhetoric around Kanye is often very reductionistic and ableist against those of us with more severe symptoms.",

I\u2019ve always wanted to wear bright colored shirts and the cute blouses that just sat in my closet, but every time I put them on I would sweat through them in about five minutes. I wear black shirts or a jacket nearly every day. I even bought those underarm pads off of Amazon. Nothing really helped. I was too embarrassed to tell my doctor about it, but I worked up the courage before my dermatologist appointment yesterday. She gave me some samples of Qbrexza and told me I\u2019d see results in about 10 days. I used the first cloth last night, and for the first time that I can remember I didn\u2019t sweat through my shirt today. The results were immediate. I called my pharmacy this afternoon to see if my insurance would cover most of it, and I found out I was one of the lucky people with a $35 copay. I actually cried from happiness and ordered it immediately. I just thought I\u2019d share this because there are ways to help it, you just need to talk to your doctor and figure out what you can do. I\u2019m so glad that I\u2019ve finally gotten relief. It was surreal being able to lift my arms without having to worry if I had sweat stains. I can\u2019t wait for that to become my norm!!"

I don\u2019t necessarily mean technology; rather, I\u2019m referring to ethical or logical dilemmas. \n\nI have the following issues: I am unable to take birth control because I am at high risk of having a stroke. I am also not sexually active (especially not with men). Why, then, am I required to have two methods of birth control? Why am I being held accountable to not get pregnant and being presumed to be so untrustworthy that I\u2019m required to take regular pregnancy tests?\n\n\nThe entire concept is built on outdated, and somewhat sexist and homophobic, beliefs. I\u2019ve heard of AFAB people who are unable to receive their next dosage because a doctor messed up. They then can\u2019t receive it until they\u2019re able to take a pregnancy test. Why is the AFAB person being held accountable when the doctor messed up?\n\nI personally don\u2019t want to make extra time to take a pregnancy test, much less get pregnant, because I work at a law firm and have no desire to do either. There are other drugs that cause birth defects that are more severe, yet isotretinoin is monitored through iPledge. Why? I believe it is probably because of the main demographic of the drug- young people. It could be a discriminatory practice. Of course, this is all alleged. I was wondering if anyone has similar feelings."

Their financial situation is die because they have 2 kids who are around college-aged and a daughter who\u2019s only 5. The only treatment that might work for him is an experimental treatment which is not covered by insurance, so she has to sue her insurance company to try to get money for the treatment.

My friend and I walked there today, though I\u2019ve been there a few times before. My friend had on his Apple Watch to monitor how long and far we walked.\n\nMy friend and I were walking along the trail I just described when we noticed a woman with slightly graying hair. She was squatting and looked like she was picking something up to examine it. After she did this, she stood up, took a few steps backwards, looked down, stepped forward, then squatted again. I thought it was weird but ignored it. As we continued walking, she kept doing the same movements down to the facial expression she was making. She\u2019d squat down for a bit to pick up this item, then stand up and walk backwards, only to return to the same spot and squatting position with the same smile on her face. I noticed that her hair wasn\u2019t blowing in the wind, which was probably the weirdest thing to me because it was very windy. My friend nudged me and asked if I was seeing all of this as well, and I nodded. We quickly turned around and walked back towards the main path. \n\nI have OCD and experience repetitive compulsive behaviors, and this looked different to me, though it was my first thought. I guess it\u2019s still possible that she was just dealing with a compulsion, but I\u2019m still uncomfortable with the fact that her hair wasn\u2019t moving.

I think this story is probably one of the most telling.\n\nKevin and I are best friends, and we have another very close friend who I\u2019ll call Dylan. Dylan speaks in a yelling voice, which I feel is important for visualizing this story. We also both like to go on long winded rants about things that are exaggerated or simply not true. This is a common occurrence, and it\u2019s very obvious to me when someone is making up something now. Dylan gets quieter and smiles a lot less. I raise my eyebrows and am very obvious with my facial expressions. Neither of us say these things with a deadpan face. Usually, though, Kevin is entirely clueless until we explain.\n\nThe three of us were hanging out in Kevin\u2019s basement when Kevin announced that he had no idea what a clitoris is. \u201cWell actually,\u201d he corrected himself, \u201cI know it\u2019s like a woman\u2019s penis, but I don\u2019t know what it looks like.\u201d Dylan and I stared at each other for a solid few seconds before I responded.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s about 3 inches long,\u201d Dylan continued. I immediately knew where he was going with this. \n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Kevin asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, Google it.\u201d Kevin looked up the length of the clitoris and was shocked to find that the clitoris was actually 3 inches long.\n\n\u201cSo, wait. When girls masturbate... Do they just like....\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, Kevin. Let me explain. That\u2019s the average length right? That\u2019s because it grows out of the body as women get older,\u201d I lied, very obviously. \u201cThat\u2019s why, in porn, you can\u2019t really see it.\u201d Dylan and I were both laughing and I was using my \u2018exaggeration voice\u2019, which should have made it clear that we were joking.\n\n\u201cGuys, stop laughing. I feel so clueless for not knowing this,\u201d Kevin responded. I stopped laughing in amazement. He actually still believed us. \u201cI\u2019ve taken anatomy and sex ed and they didn\u2019t tell us about this! I hate public school.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that weird. You\u2019re gay, you wouldn\u2019t know. Most people don\u2019t until they get older,\u201d Dylan reasoned. \n\n\u201cThere also might be another reason for public schools to not teach you that,\u201d I said, losing my cool even more. At this point, I was debating the morality of letting a gay man believe that elderly women had small penis-like genitals. I decided that this information would probably never be relevant in his life, if he still hadn\u2019t figured out the lie from my last statement. However, we ended up inviting over more people who were not as close as the three of us. Immediately when all 3 of them had arrived, Kevin proudly announced that he had learned about clits.\n\n\u201cDid you all know that clits are actually 3 inches long?\u201d They all kind of stared blankly. \u201cDid you know they move out of the body as women get older?\u201d\n\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re joking, right?\u201d one of the friends asked. When Kevin said no, he responded, \u201cOf course I knew that.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how I learned that Kevin probably has a lot of incorrect beliefs."

Whenever the wind blows into the microphone (which happens quite often) it produces a loud noise burst that occupies the whole frequency spectrum. This is very unpleasant. \n\n\\- Maybe consider writing transcripts for your episodes. I watched some videos with the auto generated subtitles. But they are not really good (no dots or kommas). I know it is a lot of work but you could consider putting them behind a payed tier reward for Patreon, or sell them separately. I am sure there are people willing to pay for proper transcripts, as right now there is not really a lot of competition.",

If I set the stickmovement to single keys it will not crash the game but then I can obviously not use analog steering.If I disable steam input in the properties it also crashes the game.\n\nThe game seems to have analog inputs but how do I get the game to actually accept them ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:   I got it to work using BetterJoy and HIDHide which are both 3rd party tools.  \nBetterJoy makes the switch pro controller to appear as a xbox360 controller and HIDHide hides the switch controller from other appliciations in the os.  \nOnce both are setup you are able to select the \"gamepad\" configuration in the Controller layout in steam. And then TMUF accepts analog inputs from the gamepad. The backbuttons/triggers have to be setup to a and b from the controller in the steam controller configuration in order to use them."

How we often pretend we don't have sexualities is a good example, doesn't have to be full hidden beast.\n3. Utopias. Just any movies about genuine Utopias, I'd compare what people think an ideal society looks like. \n4. Control. This one would absolutely include 1984 with the whole essay in the middle explaining how Oceania works and what \"War is Peace\" means. Might also include Dune Messiah with how the idea of a constitution being a powerful entity with no conscious and no one to control it is brought up. So movies that match that type of thing. \n5. Humanity's end game. Could be a different species too but just anything that talks about what humans are aiming for with all this scientific advancement, where should we try to be in 40000 years or is it just gonna get worse and we should end it now or revert to ape.

So it seems it's not canon right now but Brandon has some regrets about making Atium as a god metal only burnable by mistborn and mistings, and so has said that he's considered changing it so that what the scadrians of the Final Empire thought was Atium was really just an alloy of Atium and Electrum. If this becomes the case we will then no longer know what pure Atium does, maybe it'd do something more in line with Ruin's intent like essentially granting the surge of division or buffing hemalurgy, but we will then know what two alloys of Atium do allomantically, Malatium and Atium-Electrum. Malatium is an alloy Atium and gold, and the coppermind states it has the effect of either allowing the burner to see the past of another person or who they would've become if they had made different decisions, essentially allowing you the effects of burning gold but aimed at another person. Atium-Electrum would of course have the effect of allowing you to see another's future actions, again like burning electrum but aimed at another person. We know that all god metals can alloy with each of the sixteen allomantic metals, so what if this is what atium does when alloyed with each, apply the effects of the base metal to another person? Or in the case of metals that already affect other people, affecting you instead. Reversing the target of the metal.  think it really could be and would be consistent and awesome so here's what I would guess the sixteen alloys would do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBendalloy: speeds up the targets time, probably in the same bubble effect unless it wants to essentially apply steel feruchemy which is op enough by itself. This could be super useful as a support technique for your allies.\n\nCadmium: same as Bendalloy but just slow. Take an enemy out of the fight or trap them for a little while without having to include yourself. VERY useful I'd think, just an objectively better cadmium as a god metal should be.\n\nGold and Electrum we already know.\n\nZinc and Brass: riot and dampen your own emotions instead, just objectively useful for obvious reasons and as a way for zinc and brass mistings without access to a copper cloud or aluminium to block the effects of emotional attackers.\n\nCopper: allow you to anchor a copper cloud to someone else, creating potentially multiple more focused clouds.\n\nBronze: Should this one just allow to make others hear allomantic pulses? Maybe it could be used as either support or an allomantic audio flashbang if you flare it or use duralumin. Potentially could even emulate ruin's ability to speak to the minds of the insane, hemalurgic, and other people with particularly broken spirit webs. That latter option definitely sounds like the effects of ruin's investiture.\n\nSteel and iron: now this could be quite fun. Imagine an allomancer being able to force others to be pushed or pulled by nearby metal, now THAT sounds like something ruin would love, throwing around your enemies like rag dolls.\n\nPewter: to be consistent here it should probably buff other people, but to align more with ruin weakening the target might make a little more sense. Could be both or either.\n\nTin: same situation as pewter.\n\nThe enhancement ones might be more finicky since apart from touch they already have the target vs burner idea down.\n\nDuralumin and aluminium: these would become ranged versions of nicrosil and chromium respectively. \n\nNicrosil and chromium: to reverse these would just make them duralumin and aluminium so if you like my idea for those then these would have to do something different. I think that with the atium alloys of duralumin and aluminium being so ridiculously powerful it would make sense to have hard counters for them. Both could act as either just a personal thing or a copper cloud to block them as copper blocks emotional allomancy. I like the cloud most for balancing reasons so I'd say nicrosil creates clouds to block atium-duralumin and chromium clouds to block atium-aluminium.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Does this all make sense? Is it what you'd want atium to do? And what do you think pure atium's allomantic effects should be?"

                "body": "Are all Heralds unchained like Ishar now?\n\nSo we know the surges used before humans arrived on Roshar were far more powerful than the Rosharan equivalents due to Honor's essentially safety settings. Ashyn was devestated and reading on the coppermind I just learnt that there was a form of Yolish cohesion right now called microkinesis that was used in some sort of disastrous event, bad enough that Kriss is thankful that it was limited. This second example is particuarly interesting here because cohesion is not a surge of bondsmiths but it wasn't just more powerful, it was devestating, so we have real in book evidence that it probably wasn't just bondsmiths that destroyed Ashyn.\n\nSo anyway, I REALLY hope that the Heralds are all at least to some level unchained now when bonded with their honorblade. I'm gonna assume only they're viable because no one seemed concerned that Ishar's blade was bonded to Sezth's father, obviously he'd probably be less of a threat but in the hands of Ishar this thing is like a nuke in your pocket; but also just because I doubt Brandon would allow random people to be that powerful, the Heralds have to have something cool to them in terms of power I'd think, they've got a direct sorta proto-nahel bond to Honor itself. But even if only Ishar can because of adhesion, and Vyre/Szeth couldn't do anything special because of Windrunners having a little more limitation from Cultivation or something, just imagine how AWESOME it would be.\n\nNale triple lasing castles as projectiles in war, and him and Chanarach severe the ground beneath them, maybe even like the shattered plains. Chanarach and Vedel could slick up a whole battlefield and allow only themselves and their radiants to get traction within a 50km radius. Progression could be used to create entire forests, or strangle a city in trees. Paliah and Shallash blocking out the sky with an illusion, or creating the image of whole armies. Lasers and gamma rays are apparently within the domain of illumination, that could be quite fun, death ray heralds? Or perhaps a wave of stormlight that turns everything it covers into obsidian through transformation. Then there's Battar and Kalak's transportation, don't like this army approaching? Maybe it would be convenient to send the whole thing marching to the Horneater Peaks via the inverted, bead filled route. Kalak and Taln could give Cultivation a taste of home with their neo-microkinesis cohesion. And lastly there's Taln and Ishar's tension (which seems fitting), I'm not even entirely sure what this does lmao, it can turn things rigid, could they also melt mountains? Considering how seemingly quick and menial the task of forefully bonding the spren that controls highstorms to himself was for Ishar this all seems well within the potential power range.\n\nI doubt the cultivation is limiting the other Heralds specifically more, maybe we could have known if Jezrien ever got his blade if it was just an adhesion thing, but they are all bonded to the power of Honor not cultivation so I think there's a chance. Biggest question then is why does Nale not unleash hell on the coalition, but considering how confused he is about everything, and the fact that he was seemingly not absolutely obliterating the lines of troops with just his honorblade and skill alone when we have no reason to believe he's not at least Ishar level skilled and DEFINITELY ha no issue with killing anyone to achieve his goals, I'd expect he's vastly holding back whether his powers are unchained or not, perhaps he supports the singers fully but doesn't quite meld with the idea of being the best soldier for his torturer of millenia."

                "body": "Why do people want Kaladin to take up Honor/the Stormfather?\n\nFirst of all, the Stormfather path seems kind of disappointing and wrong for him if it is possible. He's not a spren so an indefinite amount of time spent somewhat residing over the Honorspren and delivering stormlight doesn't sound like his sort of thing to me. I do prefer this one though, if he would be a more active stormfather who wouldn't need persuasion to save someone. It could lead to him being a tyrant of his own ideals with all that power though, which could suck for him and everyone else.\n\nSo then the Honor theory. I absolutely love the shards and how their taken up, and Taravangian's ascension, yoooooo, but I don't see it being worth it for the Vessel, with all the downsides I think it's a heavy duty that would be almost entirely a loss for them. All shards have strong side effects that align with their intent. To convey my thoughts here I'll make a list of the known downsides, ones I think exist, and how Honor's downsides work.\n\nAight so known downsides we've got: \n\nRuin: Can't create anything and I would say is impatient due to the rigidity and single-minded nature of it's intent.\n\nPreservation: Can't create anything and is strongly against any change, good or bad.\n\nHarmony: Struggles to do anything, essentially.\n\nOdium: Blinded by the strength of it's hatred and desires, I'd say that's the reason Rayse could be toppled, all that power and foresight wasn't enough to stop his goals from being overshadowed by his impulsive (for a shard) emotions and how personally he took everything.\n\nCultivation: Seems to automatically cultivate (heh) change for the better or worse, as much as the current one no doubt has incredible foresight I would guess half the reason for her work on Taravangian just came from her being unable to resist how incredibly the idea of elevating a human to a shard aligns with her intent.\n\nMy theories on some of the others' downsides:\n\nAmbition: Here I would guess that since the intent is literally achieving greatness that it would have a similar downside to Cultivation, but more exclusively for it I think the Vessel would struggle with dissatisfaction and perfectionism, like any real person with a lot of ambition but multiplied to the immense level of a shardic intent.\n\nYou could imagine the rest. Endowment could essentially be an impartial sponsor, Autonomy selfish and struggles to intervene, Mercy unable to do what's needed to prevent harm, etc. (If there's not already a post about the downsides of all the shards we should make one).\n\nSo then what's Honor's downsides? Well first off there's the obvious and well known downside of the difficulty it has in breaking oaths that have become invalid, but what does this mean for the Vessel, particularly Kaladin? I think Honor would be a painful shard to take up for someone as pure hearted as Kal, he would no doubt want to help everyone as best as he could, but a shard's ability to intervene is severely limited. Kaladin could spent thousands of years desperately wanting to help but being crushed by the weight of his impotence combined with the shard's intent desperately wanting him to uphold his oaths/desire to do so. And that's just on Roshar. If he takes up Honor and holds onto it until the cosmere spanning wars start, what would that mean for him? Would he know how to fulfill his oaths in the face of possibly ten or so other shards along with other planets all with their own reasons and desires, could he even? \n\nI think with his windrunner oaths he's definitely a good candidate, I just worry that for him it's going to be a grand scaled version of the pain he feels when he couldn't save others like Tien and his soldiers in the past, yes his oaths involve managing that guilt but it's always going to be a part of anyone that's as good as he is. Wit/Hoid definitely had his reasons for not becoming a Vessel that are worth considering.\n\nSo yeah, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this :)"

Another way to think about it is \"What is it about this culture or loud music practice that I do not like/irritates me?\" Putting the focus on the behavior and actions and less about the people themselves is going to be what gets you away from racist thoughts \"these people\" generalizations that are not helpful, and more towards specific issues (where do the quiet people/towns in Mexico reside and let me go there\"  The worry about racism/judgement though, is more \"Are you attributing blame towards the people and culture?\" as a result of this contrast in expectations/experience - then what are other way can you reframe or think about it?   \n\n\n* Managing the expectation itself. Start expecting that you ARE going to hear loud music everywhere you go, so as not to be surprised when it happens, to at least let go of the disappointment or desire for it to be something that it isn't.   \n\n* Focusing on what you can control.

Just getting started with writing your novel\n\n2.) Looking for someone to brainstorm with, hold you accountable, give regular feedback\n\n3.) Are dedicated and will likely commit to one chapter a week for 26 weeks (The chapters can be elaborated outlines/1st drafts-- don't worry too much about perfection-the goal is to finish the novel before the end of the year!)\n\n4.) The coursera course is an extra thing I am doing for keeping pace and holding myself accountable, so if you are interested in this too, [here's the link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/write-your-first-novel), but not necessary, you can just join the group and go at your own pace.\n\n5.) Bonus if you enjoy fantasy/scifi and like to write in the genre, but not required, just know it's what I'll be primarily writing.\n\nDM if you are interested!"

After my previous, rather shitty relationship finally fell apart and I ended it, I wound up dating my coworker (who I had a MASSIVE crush on). I knew some stuff about him, and saw some green flags. But let me tell you, nothing prepared me for when we actually started dating.\n\nThis man asks me for consent about basically everything. And as long as he has my consent, he's willing to do *anything.* He focuses on me, and makes sure I'm comfortable and having a good time. He checks in on my boundaries, and if he tries something new, he checks in to make sure I'm ok with what he's doing. He's not scared to be rough with me, he's not timid or boring at all, but he has control. *And I actually matter to him!*\n\nIt's not just in the bedroom I've noticed this too. With different situations where my choices are involved, he'll wait until I want his thoughts, and when he offers them he's said things like how he can't tell me what to do, and doesn't want to. He *likes* that I'm independent, and have my own life with my own friends and interests. He's the same way, and it's so nice not to feel smothered out the gate. \n\nObviously, things are still new and we'll see where it goes. But I've never been in a relationship with so goddamn many green flags in my life. I'm so excited about this guy. It feels like, holy shit there really are good ones out there!"

I think they might be in the hibiscus family.\n\nIn Colorado, bloomed in the summer (maybe late summer) through early autumn. It was kind of a tree shrub hybrid, they were probably 7 feet tall (especially when unkempt) with skinny branches. The buds of the flowers would start small and round, and bloom to be these fluffy pink flowers with layers of petals. When they died, they turned purple and would fall off and be super crunchy (I loved crushing them like leaves lol). They didn't really have a scent. I don't recall seeing anything in their centers, no stamen sticking out or anything, but the petals were delicate and large not compact or dense. \n\nIt's the middle of the night where I am, but I can take a picture of the non-flowering bush tomorrow if that will help (there's one where I live now). Until then, I can say the closest picture I've found is this: https://imgur.com/a/YdSYz83 But it doesn't quite seem right? Is there another type of hibiscus this could be?"

It was her. I loved her and the way I thought about her was not platonic at all. It helps give me some closure, I think.

By the time we got there, it was dark and just the two of us. We walked for a while before heading back. When I asked this girl to hang out, that's exactly what I said: \"hang out\". I felt if I had said \"date\" it would have scared her off since we only started talking for about a week or two before.\n\nSo for our second \"date\", she suggested we get coffee and walk around the promenande shops. I threw in the idea that afterward we could go stargazing (it's something she likes doing) and she agreed. \n\nMy only problem is that I haven't officially asked her out on a \"date\" yet.

                "body": " From what I have noticed of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series (the books more specifically), I notice that Greg Heffley tends to show large amounts of traits of Antisocial Personality Disorder (commonly referred to as Sociopathy). Though out the series, I have noticed that Greg tends to only smile when he makes other people suffer, like in the scene of where he throws an apple at Patty and ruins the entire play. After the scene, while everyone else is angry, he is smiling. Despite this being a rather small detail, it could certainly give insights into the childhood of the protagonist of Diary of a Wimpy Kid's childhood and how his father truly treated him when he was young (despite the few scenes of flashbacks via Greg).\n\nFrom what I have noticed in the book, Greg Heffley had a highly strained relationship with his father to where he ended up being constantly criticized and demeaned father. His father had overbearing expectations for Greg Heffley, who his father saw as a deadbeat with no future. Frank likely forced Greg into doing things that he did not want to do as a child to where he tended to even hit Greg and destroyed his belongings, though this is a rather undeveloped theory, it is surely a theory that could be true within the book. Greg was likely implied to experience large amounts of suffering as a child due to the very high chance that Greg has ASPD (another way of saying that he is a Sociopath). To convey this even more, \"Sociopathy\" is like ignoring one's own pain and adding this pain to others. I suspect that as a child, Greg rode the tricycle down the hill and that someone in his family (most likely Frank or Rodrick) tried to throw a football at him to encourage Greg to engage in physical activities and to overall have \"fun\", though it resulted in Gregory fracturing his arm bones. He also had a lot of his toys and other things broken or taken from him constantly by Rodrick and even his father by \"accident\". He seemed like a character that was hidden in tragedy who wanted to use this tragedy to inflict pain onto others.\n\nRodrick also played a large role in Greg's ASPD development due to how much Rodrick bullied Greg over time as a child to where he would then transfer this pain of bullying onto Rowley and even Manny at times (especially the time where Greg kicked Manny's toys down), though Manny kind of deserves it. Gregory also wanted to become more and more popular among those around him, but this could be a coping response to the lack of friends that he truly had as a child. He wanted to get what he never got as a child, which was social-recognition and those who liked him. He ended up becoming more and more vain and narcissistic due to the fact that he realized that a lot was missing from his life that he wanted to account for via becoming popular and competitive. Also, I believe that a lot of the pranks that Gregory had done to Rowley as well as Gregory's judgmental and overall abusive attitude comes from his brother (the pranks) and his father (his judgmental attitude). Overall, his abusive behaviors had a lot to do with his past and the trauma that he represses to where he unconsciously brings this trauma onto others."

Do you think that maybe Venli and Kaladin would be a good match up or ending together? If we want to add more changes in both sides of their histories, becoming the first singer-human couple (if Renarin and Rlain doesn't end together before) would be an interesting point and would positioning themselves to make the path of honor even more feasible on the side against Odium. I think that considering their histories they have a lot of common things and achievements as their radiant careers and could understand and support  each other very well and, why not? even loving."

I know that maybe there would be differences, just like culture (I assume that most people of this sub would be from US or other countries rather than Mexico), or gender (I know that male INFJs are kind of lesser than female INFJs), and that those could possibly add difficult for the advices, but if you guys where typified as INFJs there should be some possibly common territories in which we work in. Also, if anyone who doesn't is an INFJ want to give advice its ok :) \n\nThe advices I'm looking for consist in: How to actually make people feel comfort with you, which is the limit of help you can give people you like without being a SIMP, and what can you tell me about developing communication with your partner?"

The fact that you\u2019re both committed members of a group will add a layer of pressure to the relationship that doesn\u2019t help with discernment. Looking back, it would have been better for me to have distanced myself from the group after the break up, rather than having to keep revisiting the person and the inevitable painful yearning that I would feel every time. \n\nAll that being said, it seems like a high-risk, high-reward thing that you have to occasionally pursue in life. You might regret not pursuing it.\n\nIf you only go on a few dates, and you keep your feelings in check, it\u2019s a less insurmountable level of awkwardness, and you can get past it fairly easily and continue attending the group together.",

Had the final season been great or just pretty good, we might still be in that cultural era. \n\nThe show started midway through the Obama presidency, and peaked around 2015, which was the peak year of millennial culture in my view. It stood on the shoulders of other prestige dramas (breaking bad, mad men etc) but eclipsed them in scale and overall largeness. Milennials who stuck with it for years made it a big part of their personalities. It was an easy conversation topic for anyone who watched it, and unlike virtually all other shows these days, a LOT of people watched it.\n\nGen Z's mostly missed the early seasons of the show because they were too young, and not yet in the habit of watching long prestige cable shows as millennials were. They either never watched it, or took a hundred hours to catch up while the later seasons were airing. The disastrous ending of the show resulted in either a) a confirmation of their preconceived biases against it (and against the millennial culture supporting it) or b) a sense of  betrayal that they had invested so much of their young life into the show. Never again would they let that happen! This was when more niche media with quicker and more reliable payoff became the cultural norm (memes etc) which is what I associate with gen z culture.\n\nThere hasn't been a show with so much of a cultural footprint since GOT ended, and some millennials who were really invested in the show have genuinely not recovered from how it ended and immediately stopped being relevant, with no other shows of comparable scope and quality to take its place.\n\nJust a theory from a zillennial who never actually watched the show but was surrounded by its cultural impact. Let me know what you think."

The ability to communicate multigenerationally is important for management and leadership positions. \n\nFor the cusper, older employees see them as the young hotshot who is somewhat relatable, and younger employees see them as mature and experienced, and also somewhat relatable. Both of these factors work in their favor. This tracks with what I've seen in the workplace, where the managers I've had/seen have been largely Jonesers and Xennials. I've even heard of some 97/98s who have been rapidly promoted at their post-college jobs. Edit: see this link under \"workplace importance\" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusper\n\nCores, on the other hand, often feel tragically isolated at work if they don't have coworkers from the same generational cohort who are on the same wavelength. This often results in their being deemed \"non-management material.\"\n\nWhat I haven't seen discussed as much, but what I've personally observed, is that core boomers/Xers/millennials/zoomers often have better and more coherent social lives with wider social circles, compared to cuspers. I suspect it's because public schooling sorts us from an early age with people of our own birth years. Therefore, cores are surrounded by people exactly like them throughout youth and young adulthood. Their peers have similar values, attitudes, technologies, entertainment, and all the other things that make generations distinct.\n\nCuspers, on the other hand, have a very mixed bag of same-age peers. My friends from high school were probably half millennial and half gen z, despite all being born in 1995. This fact results in somewhat incoherent friend groups where people have different tastes, tech platforms, expectations, etc. Cuspers that I know generally have fewer friends as a result.\n\nHas anyone else observed this?"

Others say it was used by group/person ABC who's sexist so that must mean the word itself is sexist. So its very subjective as it seems and I - as a non-native speaker - didn't even know this debate existed in the first place! So yes it's an excuse. I thought it was as normal as saying woman, men, boy, girl, person or whatever.\n\nThen you got all this rude comments  who didnt even try to teach or address the topic and were like \"maybe you got no girlfriend because you say female\". Tell me what's the point in that? \n\nAnd even if you teach me in a polite way: what would it bring me or you? I have two dates this week. I won't use \"female\" because I literally can't. I will speak german. I will call her by her name or address her as \"Frau\". So why this endless debate about \"women won't like this!\" if it has no relevance at actual IRL dates?\n\nIts not my own ego that stops me from learning altogether its my active decision to reject the idea of being so stubborn over one word especially when the whole topic I tried to address gets undermined and I get ridiculed then yes, absolutely I get very rude and defensive. I pour even more gasoline into the fire because in my POV the \"fire\" is there for absolutely no reason.

She told me Im her type and when we skyped she flirted a lot and we acted silly.\n\nSo I set up a date for sunday. We talked on thursday and throughout the weekend she rarely texted back and till sunday she didn't reply so I asked if she was anxious - nothing. So I called her out in the evening on this \"ghosting\" (because she already ghosted me when we had 1st contact - and apologized) and she said she's sorry and its indeed an unacceptable thing. She told me she doesn't know why she acts like that maybe its because it doesn't work like she would like it to.\n\nDays after this I tried it again. She said she's really surprised and happy that Im getting in touch. I said Im surprised she's happy about that and she told me she is 100%. \n\nI dont know why do people act like this??? \"Oh I'm such a bad person I would understand if you would leave me but I'm glad you're here so I can change absolutely nothing and speak in hieroglyphes\". Had this a million times and never got it.\n\nIm so confused on what I did wrong ..."

Just didn't reply anymore We came ironically into contact because I asked her why she did it. She said she was just \"whack\" (yes a lot of red flags - yes Im an idiot)\n\nShe wasn't like my usual type, but I still liked her very much and found her attractive so I just wanted to know if she's right for me.\n\nWe texted nearly everyday for 2-3 weeks and I set up a date for this sunday. We were both excited and we flirted a lot and acted silly when we skyped. We were a 100% into eachother. She even did some sexual jokes about sunday. The only point where we disagreed was our way of viewing relationships. I like to be more independent and focused on myself (I work 2 jobs and go to the gym + I learned through a painful way you cant rely on a relationship today - family and friends are more stable). She likes to get to the point a bit faster in relationships which kind of stressed me out  a bit and I noticed she's a bit insecure about her weight but nothing too extreme I still accepted her 100%.\n\nI noticed something was slightly off so I asked if nothing has changed and she told me she's sorry for texting back so rarely and yes she wants too meet.\n\nNext day I tried to call her after work cause I really like to talk to her - no answer.\n\nOn saturday evening and on sunday I sent multiple text messages asking if shes kind of anxious about it or if she want's to cancel it - nothing.\n\nAfter I called her out on it and saying I can't be the only one bringing input she just told me that its indeed an unacceptable behaviour and shes sorry but it doesn't work for her like she wants it to. I asked why the sudden change if we haven't even met yet - nothing. Technically speaking it isn't ghosting, but I don't know how to describe it in a fast way.\n\nSo for some reason I feel really bad about myself since yesterday. Did I say something wrong? Did I came off as clingy or too distant? Why the sudden change ..\n\nIt shouldn't affect me but it kind of does a lot surprisingly.\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this? Did anyone of you ghost someone and why?"

The issue wasn\u2019t race, he just didn\u2019t fit the semi-dorky, kind of quirky/streamer imagine that the brand represents so well. Additionally, everyone in OTK had been friends for years before this, and the ones who were later initiated into the org genuinely enjoyed each other\u2019s company, and would go to every event. Cyr and Emi are great examples of this. Even Schlatt hung/vibed with the crew for most of his OTK career before exiting. Bruce never really hung with anyone from OTK before he was added. And I believe once he was he was on one content piece which was the lie detector test. Now, there is nothing wrong with Bruce choosing business first, I just think Bruce should have thought more about if he really vibed with the guys he just signed a contract with. OTK should have thought first about the relationship exclusivity of OTK and how foundational that is and was for its success. Yes, it\u2019s a business, but first and foremost, it\u2019s a group a great friends with likeminded opinions and interests.\n\nI understand their attempt to expand the brand into new territories, but sometimes it can make a company lose sight on what made them great. If OTK is smart and can learn from what happened, I hope they actually do consider bringing Extraemily and Bonnie in next. Both vibe amazingly with the Org, consistently have OTK members on their streams, and fit that quirky streamer imagine.",

Bad publicity is still good publicity even if it sucks for the creator, but these idiots seem to have forgotten that. Along with this, it's basically impossible to take down a fanbase of 30k with a 4k twitter hate squad. When I was watching him, there were very little hate comments I could pinpoint because to me they just sounded like comments from a typical Miz stream. It's because our boy can take an insult. In all honesty, i think Miz lives for insults. Sure, there is a point to where things became too much, I understand that, but compared to most streamers and people, Miz has always been good at turning jabs at him into light hearted jokes.\n\nBut yeah man omegalul. Imagine telling someone to go fuck themselves genuinely, only for that person to make thousands from your hate. I wonder if we mentioned this to the Twitter mob, they actually stop rofl. "

Use the job gage \"Tenure Track\" to unlock party support abilities like Grace Period (gives everyone an extra window to get clear before enemy AOEs go off).

One of these series was about a group of girls who were at a Jewish summer camp. The protagonist was pretty shy but immediately got taken in by an active and creative friend. With the rest of the cabin, they got up to a lot of wacky adventures - like their cabin flooded and they offered tours of it to the other cabins. I remember one of the girls was from Montreal and made a big deal about throwing in French words sometimes - there was a whole \"*mais oui*/may we\" routine at some point. They may have been *frum* or at least Orthodox. \n\nI'm pretty certain the books first came out around 1994-1996. The books were definitely aimed at 9-12, about as long and complex as your average Babysitter's Club story.  I've asked family and a few friends, and while my sister and mom vaguely remember the books, they don't remember much more than I do. Does anyone else remember these or know the name of them (or the author)? Or does anyone know a good way to try to search for books like this from this era?"

I've tried Group Finder, but no dice.\n\nI have a Lvl 60 Paladin with a Zodiac Weapon I'd prefer to use, but I've got all ARR tank, healer, and caster jobs to Lvl 50 or higher. I'm flexible on doing it synced or not, or with a full party or not. As FFXIV is my first real MMO, I'm also open to feedback - I'm here to learn and improve.\n\nAlso flexible on time - I'm in PST and often playing later at night, though my work schedule is flexible. Midweek evenings are often the hardest time for me.  I do want to watch the cut scenes on this first playthrough. \n\nIf you're either doing this for the first time like me or want to train someone up for endgame ultimate content, I'm not opposed to getting the gang back together for other post-expansion raids and content like the Alexander raids post-Heavensward. I also have been on the Free Trial, but just bought the full game during this most recent sale. \n\nI do have discord, but I don't regularly check it, so let's start here on Reddit. \n\nThanks!"

                "body": "Just finished my first playthrough of the whole trilogy (LE) and, boy, was that a ride! I played a Spacer paragon soldier Shepard, romanced Kaiden (as MShep), and blew away the reapers at the end. \n\nThe final choice I'd heard so much about was a bit underwhelming. Control is so obviously problematic and Rejection wrong, but Synthesis was not well-established in-game as a decent answer. I don't think it's right what Destroy does to other synthetics but considering the alternatives, it was the only compelling choice.\n\nFrom a lore perspective, the role of the Protheans really fascinates me. Javik does a lot to undermine their true accomplishments, IMO, and I say this as someone who loved Javik in so many ways and even brought him on the final mission (it felt appropriate).\n\nIn a nutshell, the Protheans, despite being blindsided by the Reapers and losing their ability to coordinate centrally not only managed to seed warning throughout the galaxy but also modify the Keepers to prevent the signal from going off, and figure out what the Reapers wanted well enough to leave information in plain view to give the next wave of space-faring peoples a fighting chance - the Mars Archive and Temple in Thessia being the most obvious examples.\n\nHumanity's role in Why This Cycle Is Different is something I've been thinking a lot about. Assuming the Reapers are triggered by Organics destroying the AI they created, the Citadel DLC shows C-Sec destroying an AI well before humans had spaceflight. If that was supposed to be the trigger that brought the Reapers back, the Asari, Salarians, Turians (et. al.) would have been dead and gone by the time humans reached the moon, much less the Citadel. \n\nBut thanks to the Prothean sabotage, there are *two* apex races by the time the Reapers arrive. And the two aren't at each other's throats, at least not militarily. I think Asari-Human social and moral compatibility is quite important. If humanity enters an empty Citadel, I can easily see them become the next cycle's Leviathan or Prothean emperors. But as a junior partner, that's relegated to unofficial organizations like Cerberus.\n\nOf course the central question is why do species turn on their AIs in the first place? Is Shepard just different because he treats EDI decently?"

Also if you're wondering how I came across this post if I'm a nonbeliever, I fell down a internet rabbit hole, as I often do) Also it makes no logical sense to me that the exact moment you were born dictates your entire personality, it's so counterintuitive. When you take a personality test, even if the test is superficial and crappy at least it is based a little on your way of thinking, your decision and the way you see yourself so it makes sense it will be somewhat accurate. Sure, both sun signs and mbti archetypes are general and superficial, they have to fit a variety of different people in 12/16 boxes after all, but in my case at least, mbti hits much closer to home, while my signs are way off",

(1988). Economic and philosophic manuscripts of 1844 and the Communist manifesto. Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus.) pg 71)*\n\nI thought I understood it, but i think i was being hardheaded and was obstinately using the contemporary meanings of the words in order to make it fit the narrative im trying to portray in the essay (i.e the character im analysing is miserable, and experiences depersonalisation as a symptom of that misery/depression due to her being exploited or something or other idrk)\n\nBut the more i try to genuinely understand what marx was trying to say, the more i don't get it at all, lowkey. Here's the passage:\n\n\"Labour produces not only commodities: It produces itself and the worker as a *commodity*\\-- and does so in the proportion in which it produces commodities generally. (I'm with it so far)\n\nThis fact expresses merely the object which labour produces- labour's product-- confronts it as *something alien*, as a power *independent* of the producer (still with it). The product of labour is labour which has been congealed in an object, which has become material: it is the objectification of labour (a bit iffy, but i think i still get it). Labour's realisation is its *objectification (idk anymore)*. **In the conditions dealt with by the political economy this realisation of labour appears as** ***loss of reality*** **for the workers:** objectification as *loss of the object* and *object-bondage*: appropriation as *estrangement*, as *alienation.*\" (Now i'm lost) (still page 71)\n\nI know very well that this is lowkey marx at his most easy to understand, but i can't help that im stupid, please can someone  explain this in a way that i can understand? i will be eternally grateful"

The universe has forced me into a situation where I won't run into you anymore. The reason I don't call or text is because I choose not to. I've proven time after time that I cannot reach out to you and remain emotionally sober. The best path seems to be to just let it all go, and see what the universe has in store for me.\n\nThe thing is, I don't have that kind of faith. I'll find any excuse I can to do things my way. Maybe that's why I'm writing this. I still struggle with these feelings, and they want to convince me that I need to do something, to say something. I should just delete this and trust that things will turn out the way they are supposed to.\n\nOn the other hand, things will turn out how they're supposed to whether or not I send this, I guess.

I let myself trust you because I wanted this new life so badly. Fuck you.\n\nI almost relapsed tonight. I sought out a dealer. My fucking sponsor, who helped me find this job in the first place, didn't even bother calling me after I told him I didn't get this job. I'm so angry. I've been trying so goddamn hard. I do my fucking day job that I hate. I tolerate my alcoholic housemates, who don't include me in anything because I don't drink like they do. I go to meetings, do service, follow up responsibly on job leads. I have not gotten one single goddamn thing that I want in return. I realize this isn't how the world works. Even so, what in the goddamn motherfucking hell. Rejected by a guy who seemed to be getting close to me. Rejected by someone who seemed to be handing me this amazing job.\n\nHow much more of this pointless, useless, meaningless bullshit do I need to take before things finally start getting better?"

I definitely get the sense that I\u2019m living in a dream - but not like I\u2019m in paradise - but more like everything that keeps happening around me will just stop? \n\n\u2018Stop worrying about old family and friends\u2019 - definitely can relate to this and it\u2019s a message that I keep reminding myself of.\n\nI think everyone has time in their life where they think about the future and start panicking.\n\nOn the whole I think your poem has relatable themes and I think it could be interesting to see what happens if you just focus on one i.e Groundhog Day or forgetting the past or panicking abt the future.\n\nAlso while your poem has a good rhythm the rhyme feels a bit forced, and feels unnecessary.\n\nThanks for the poem \ud83d\ude0a",

All of them said they don\u2019t have any idea about what I have but they refused to research deeper and they just said it is anxiety. However I don\u2019t have any anxiety (which is something that I\u2019m expecting recently because of this condition).\n\nI constantly feel when I\u2019m sat or when I lie down that there are multiples and infinites earthquakes. I feel like if I\u2019m on a train and I (or the world) is moving up and down with the overhangs of the rails. These swings sometimes become so strong that I literally feel an earthquake for a couple of second like it feels the bed, the sofa or the chair is literally trembling (I had to call my family to make sure that there was no earthquake). It feels like a pendulum, but very fast and very small oscillations (to be clear, like when you kick something iron, and it oscillates for a second in a very fast and contained way). I don't think it's anxiety because they never stop, not even for a second (these days they've even gotten worse). For the past five months, I've lived my life in a train during an endless earthquake.\n\nThe ENT visit was profound. He found nothing. The physiatrist didn't seem to understand the problem, but he told me I had bad posture. The neurologist did a very superficial visit. Nobody found anything. They did not do blood tests or other tests. If it helps to contextualize, at the same time as this I've noticed that if I keep my hand around things for more than half an hour there comes a tingling (for example, I can no longer use the vacuum cleaner to clean the house).\n\nAll of this started after I took pantoprazole for five days and I\u2019ve been moving my head a lot for the past two week due to listening to music 6+ hours every day. It started randomly all of a sudsing when I was lying down and it got worse the next day.\n\nWhat could it be?"

I need my nap during lunch break and eating lunch with them would make me even more tired. \n\nI would also be awkward with people who don't know me. And I might also make people around me awkward with me. It used to be upsetting that nobody understand me or that nobody accept me for being me. I didnt do anything that would hurt others, except probably making them misunderstand that im avoiding them maybe. Lol. But now im alright. I dont take it personally and instead of wanting people to understand/accept me, i understand/accept myself instead. I'll explain to those that want to know. Otherwise, we just do our own thing. You do you, i do me. \n\nIt do affect my performance. My boss at work has commented that I'm being too quiet. Hahaha. Very sure im not quiet when im with my close friends tho xD",

His parents have shown a remarkable lack of empathy for his situation and both won't let him live with them despite the fact that they both have room for him, allbeit not much. The main reason nobody wants to let him stay with them is because he's addicted to hard drugs and has a history of shoplifting in the past. My parents won't allow him to stay with them. I gave him $50 already and I don't have much else. I'm really not sure what to do.\n\nThanks for reading. Feel free to ask any questions you may have. Any advice at all is appreciated."

So if you believe that shifting is literally shifting your awareness to a completely different and real reality and that when you shift you leave behind a \"clone\" which is really just a version of you that didn't shift, then it makes sense that that \"clone\" would try to shift after you have already shifted, thereby creating an endless chain reaction of \"you\"s shifting over and over again because there will always be a you that shifts and a you that doesn't shift. \n\nWith this in mind, when you shift from your DR back to your OR or to a different reality, there should also be a version of you that didn't shift as you did, or a \"clone\" in your DR. Thereby creating another endless chain of \"you\"s trying and failing to leave your DR. \n\nIf this theory is correct then this should hypothetically be happening all of the time, like every single moment of every single day, infinite different versions of you are shifting accidentally and on purpose to other realities and there are also infinite different versions of you trying to shift and \"failing\".\n\nWith that in mind, that would technically mean that every single one of us are clones and that it's also possible to try forever and never shift but also that you are technically successful every time you attempt to shift.\n\nSorry if none of that made sense, but is my theory correct? If not then please point out what I've misunderstood about shifting theory."

As far as I understand, there are users on this site that work in guilds and hoard rare items to inflate to the 100s of thousands/millions. Until TNT takes action against that this will continue, and TNT has yet to take action on a lot of things. Best example is that TNT hasn't given a statement re: fixing the site breach and vulnerability (AFAIK) - so I doubt this is high on their radar. Plus, they've yet to fix the games on the site.\n\nHowever, I think that your kindness would be appreciated for any user you would be contributing to. Kindness spreads kindness, so if you want to do it, by all means. Your genuine acts of kindness may touch the hearts of users that are starting out, need help, or are looking for specific items. \n\nI wish you only the best of luck in these trying times :)",

Typical of the games of that time it had a very 90s look.\n\nNotable characters:  There was a mouse brother and sister.  I think the mouse sister had pigtails or a ponytail.\n\nNotable gameplay mechanics:  The game started with two mice who let you in their room.  They stand around doing a hand game with each other (patty cake I believe it's called?).  Their room had a lot of different things in it that you could click on.  Clicking on different things will prompt different activities / take you to a different screen.  I think there was one where you would wash a dog?\n\nThank you everyone in advance for looking!"

You have a map with points to click on, and every point teaches you something different.   For example - one of them showed how a toilet worked.  There was a cross-section of the toilet and there usually was a puzzle to solve (for example \"water not draining\") then you would fiddle around with the parts of the toilet + test flush to see what would happen and if it fixes the problem.\nAnother part of the game dealt with tectonic plate shifts and volcanoes / lava flow.  The lava would flow out of the volcano and create a layer of residue.  When it erupted again, it built up another layer of residue.  Every layer of rock was identified as the type it was.\n\nHopefully we can find this one... Let me know if you have any ideas.  Thanks!"

I told the lady in charge of ordering lunch when I first got there that I had CD but was happy with even just a salad so I could eat with our coworkers. She\u2019s pretty hit or miss, but usually I can have the salad because she specifies croutons on the side. \n\nToday she ordered lunch for everyone despite being a regular DoorDash day.\n\nAt noon she announces that pizza had arrived. I knew I couldn\u2019t eat it but eventually went over for at least a salad. Then I got irritated. Not only does the pizza place she ordered from have a dedicated GF/keto menu, it has a dedicated GF *kitchen* and there were five huuuge party pizzas on the buffet table with not one keto/gf one. \n\nThen I got mad when I  looked at the three boxes of salad that all had croutons mixed in.\n\nSeveral of my coworkers are keto so they couldn\u2019t eat anything either, and they were all at their desks not participating either.\n\nSo I went over to her desk and then I was livid. The amount of pizza on her and our coworkers plates just told me there was plenty to go around and they were just being jerks. I\u2019m talking piled on their plates.\n\nI told her that I didn\u2019t appreciate being left out, especially when this place has known gf options. She says that she didn\u2019t know because when she ordered lunch I wasn\u2019t at my desk. I told her she knows that I need gf and that pizza place has gf options. Her coworker told me to dial it back and that she could get me a credit card to order some food. I told them that it wasn\u2019t about the food but being excluded. The lady then starts to argue stating that several people have dietary restrictions and I cut her off and told her \u201cif you are going to order food for everyone, make sure everyone can participate.\u201d She simply looked at her computer screen and said \u201cok\u201d signaling she was done with conversation.

Once I'm in the wilderness, I can increase my skills by attacking anything in sight, whereas not attacking would simply yield nothing.\n\nAll that aside, I just think it's funny to blow up goats and watch them go flying away lol",

Although the ISTJ doesn't have all of the genius and creativity that the INTJ has through their Ni, they are still smart and very effective. In fact, I'd wager that their lack of Ni is what makes them better. They don't get stuck in their heads, and they get things done. They make a schedule and stick to it. They are much less complicated, and far more efficient than the INTJ, and there's no two ways about it. The INTJ can do all of the above, yes, but it is hard to do. Their inferior Se is always pulling them off track, and they spend too much time contemplating things that don't really matter. There's a reason ISTJ's take up 13+% of the population, and INTJ's are only about 2%. \n\nThat's just how it is folks.

They most likely will go after it - they're adventures after all. The NPC tries to convince them he should join the party, if doesn't really matter he does so( it would just add to the element of surprise later on) \n\nThey enter the forest, do something and what not, and try to find this dungeon. What they don't know is the fact that it doesn't exist. The NPC lied. However, there is an ambush waiting for them down the road. \n\nThis is where my idea falls apart. I'm not sure how would aftermath of the fight look like - do they just find some gold and go on with their lives?(seems a bit anticlimactic)\nAlso, I'm not sure what, besides riches, is the bandit's motivation - why would they want to fight instead of stealing from sleepy adventurers at night?\n\nI can't think of a direct hook.

Which I totally understand as I'm keen to take things slowly as well.

We both feel very comfortable talking to one another which is a great thing, I'm just trying to understand why this particular thing might be a hang-up.\n\nOne thing I've thought about is to start sending her short video messages via Snapchat just to say hey, that sort of thing.

Just \"manage subscriptions\" which when I click that, it just shows a generic blurb about what I have paid for. Are my projects even attached to me??? I can't even log out???? I am super annoyed right now, I feel like this is like step 1 of creating an app - giving the user the option to see their own account???? Am I blind, can you help me?"

                "body": "I've always believed in ghosts but never had a paranormal experience. I'd go ghost hunting as a kid and try to investigate graveyards and abandoned buildings, but never found anything. So in theory I wanted to believe, but because I hadn't seen anything myself I had my suspicions.\n\nUntil I worked as this old as fuck Irish restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant in question was located in Massachusetts and is hundreds of years old. The downstairs is a bar/ restaurant and the upstairs is used as a function hall for weddings and events.\n\nI began working there as a server full time in the winter of 2015. There's lots of old buildings in MA so it wasn't out of the ordinary, it has the classic creeky floors and old feel to it. Within my first few days working there I heard one of the older servers talking about the ghost upstairs, which obviously made me whip my head around and go \"this place is haunted?! Tell me more!\"\n\nThis server had been working here for years and she was like 60 years old, and she wasn't super keen to talk about. She had a matter-of-fact way of answering me, she said that yes there's a presence upstairs and she just deals with it. When I pressed her for her info she said sometimes when she goes up there to get something, she'll here little kids playing or running around (when there's no one there) and said she has seen a small child in the corner of her eye before. But she wouldn't give me much more.\n\nWell, now I was intersted so I started asking all the servers about it and they were all like \"oh yeah upstairs is haunted\".\n\nI had only been up there a few times, with someone else, during the day time. Def creepy but nothing particularly strange.\n\nBut after hearing stories from other servers I needed to go up there lol. One of my friends worked as the bartender and sometimes when she was closing her boyfriend and some of his friends would come in and sit at the bar while she finishes up.\n\nSo one night, it's a Sunday and im the closing server and she's the closing bartender. I'm finished for the night so I'm having a drink at the bar, and her bf and 2 friends come in to join us. We start talking about the ghost upstairs and they agree to go with me.\n\nNow the way this place is set up is when you walk in the front door, there's a small reception area with 2 giant wooden barrels where we stack the menus. The menus are thick, heavy, leather books basically. This is important for later.\n\nThen you walk down a few stairs and entire the dining area. The bar is a big oval in the middle that has seating all around. The stairs to go upstairs are directly to the right when you enter the front door.\n\nSo me, her boyfriend, and 2 of his friends proceed to go upstairs while she stays at the bar. There's also a regular customer there with her drinking and he stays at the bar. \n\nWe go up and the lights are off, but we have are cell phone flashlights. There's normal restaurant music playing on the speakers at a normal volume, just classic background music. We're walking through in a tight group, just exploring between the tables. It is absolutely creepy, like idk how to describe it other than the air was heavy.\n\nWe're talking amongst ourselves and making jokes, like \"where's the ghost\" and \"hello Mr ghost\" etc. We're walking through and we're kind of like OK maybe there's not anything here idk. But then the music starts getting louder.\n\nAnd at first we're like oh haha, it's obviously our friend downstairs doing this to be funny. But then it keeps getting louder. Like blasting. Like so loud it hurts your ears, like NOT funny. We all start sprinting for the stairs and come rushing down.\n\nWe run into the dining area and we're like \"dude what the fuck why did u put it so loud?\" and my friend is standing in the middle of the bar looking at us like we're insane and she's like wtf r u talking about? And we're like you just put the volume up to scare us but it was so loud it hurt! And she looks at us and goes \" the music control is over there\" and she points allllllll the way accross the restaurant to a box on the wall \"I haven't moved I've been standing here closing my register\"\n\nAnd were all like WHAT. The regular at the bar confirms she didn't move. So now we're all riled up, talking about how scary that was and how obviously the ghost didn't like us.\n\nWe're all sat around the bar discussing what happened, and the regular is telling us how he's heard stories about the upstairs ghost over the years, and he goes \"sometimes when you talk about it, it makes it worse\"\n\nAll of a sudden a stack of menus falls to the floor. THE HEAVY LEATHER BOOK MENUS ALL THE WAY OVER AT THE DOOR, a whole STACK of them tumble over. Like 10-12 menus, we're talking several pounds of books. The door was closed, there was no wind, and these things were HEAVY.\n\nWe all just stare at each other and are like OK are you done closing the register yet? Time to go time to go! \n\nIt was wild, that was my only real encounter with a ghost. I stopped working at that restaurant not long after but I would love for a paranormal crew to go in there one day. \n\nI now believe these things exist lol."

I have been in sales 10 years, I've been an SDR, an AE, done outside sales, been SDR team lead, spent 4 years in Enablement primarily coaching/training the entire sales org and implementing sales processes, and most recently was SDR Manager.\n\nI thought being manager was what I wanted. I love coaching and have been very successful both in the role and in shaping SDRs into top performer's, but it turns out it's not the right job for me.\n\nBeing a manager takes a lot of patience. Sales comes naturally to me so when my team wasn't grasping basic concepts, I was susrprised but not discouraged. But after nearly 9 months in the role, I've learned that some people need a lot of repetitive hands-on training. I must have lead the same session with them 20 times. I tried many things with my team, but I realized I may not be patient enough. I love sales - I love sales training and I love doing the selling, but management isn't about training and selling, it's about, well, managing.\n\nWhen I think back to the best managers I've had, they were different than me. They can have tough conversations and apply pressure - something I've never been comfortable with (to my colleagues, in a sales setting I can lol). They are patient. And they can alter their method to match the individual. I'm not saying I'm incapable of these things, but I learned (while in the role) that I am much more suited for Enablement.\n\nThis post isn't to discourage anyone, but just food for thought. I was good at sales and good at coaching, so I thought it was only logical that I'd be a great manager. But I can humbly say there are people better built for the challenges of being a manager.\n\nSorry if I'm rambling, today's my last day in the SDR manager post and I'm moving on to lead Enablement at a tech startup so I'm reflecting a lot."

I have extremely strong letters of rec. lined up from people who know me very well and I will be able to write high quality essays.\n\nI'm looking at UW-Madison, University of Minnesota, University of Michigan, UT-Austin, USC, as well as USAFA, USNA, and USMA. On the service academies, I would be able to pass the CFA, I should be able to get a Congressional nom, and I am attending USAFA Summer Seminar. I'm also applying for AFROTC scholarships if anyone has insight as to that. Other college suggestions are appreciated too!"

I want Polnareff to make me lick his feet so badly.\n\nImagine how it would feel.\n\nHe kicked you to the ground after you lost a battle with him. It hurt, but it hurt so good. He's so much bigger than you, you couldn't help but shiver when you saw him start stepping on you. He stepped on your face and over your body. You moaned every time he stepped on you. He yelled \"You like that, petit putain?\". You couldn't help but choke out a \"Y-yes monsieur\u2026\".\n\nAfter he was done, he took off his boots and showed off his feet. They were soft, clean and had a pleasant smell.\n\nHe started rubbing your clit (or dick or whatever you have) with his feet. Even though his feet were soft, his movements were rough and it caused you to started squirming and moaning. At some point, you came from the stimulation with a visible stain in your pants. \"You came from that? Tu es une pute.\" he said seeing the stain develop in your pants.\n\nFinally the moment you've been waiting for. He shoved his bare foot in your mouth and said: \"C'mon. Suck on it.\" You started sucking his toes and then started taking on his feet. \"Be careful, I'm kinda ticklish\". He started groaning, moaning and panting. \"G-good girl, you make me so happy, ma ch\u00e9rie\".\n\nYou noticed a boner growing in his pants. He unbuckled his pants to let out his dick free. You were in awe at the size of his dick. It was 11\" and extremely girthy. It was completely drenched in veins, had a pink throbbing tip and a cute little dick hoodie (i.e. foreskin). While you were being a little slut and licking his feet, he started jacking off while randomly panting and moaning.\n\nAt some point, you managed to take in his entire foot. He lost it and starting cumming all over your clothes and face. \"G-good girl! S-such a pute-aah~!\" he moaned. He put his monster cock back in his pants and left.\n\nYou were left with cum stains and bruises from him, but you didn't care. It all felt so good to have Polnareff treat you so rough. You wanted more.\n\nSo you followed him and started yelling: \"Wait! Wait for me!\" He chuckled, god his laugh was so cute. \"You want more don't you?\" Polnareff said. \"Fine, I guess I'll give ma putain what she wants.\"."

My question is, how are there people rooting for Damon? \n\nIn only one season, he's abused Caroline physically and mentally to the point that it almost altered her personality. He turned Vicki out of \"boredom,\" destroying her life. Killed Vexi and Bree (and almost Bonnie). If these were random people that he needed to get rid of for his goal, it would be understandable. But his behavior never stops. \n\nI don't think that even if he loves Elena or does something important for her in the future, that's a good reason to like him. In 1x11 Damon kindaps Elena and she later saves his life saying that just because Damon is a killer doesn't mean people should become one too to get revenge. And a few minutes later, he kills Bree for no reason??\n\nSorry for the rant \ud83d\ude2c just want to see what people see in him"

I\u2019ve played guitar and bass off and on over the last 7 years or so, but this is the first time I\u2019ve ever even played a steel. At times I feel like i\u2019m getting a good grasp on it, I can play through Steel Guitar Rag for the most part, but operating the pedals and levers feels so incredibly unnatural. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the shoes/lack of shoes that makes it so hard for me to hit just one pedal or both pedals at the same time, but I\u2019m constantly hitting the wrong one at the wrong time or letting off when I shouldn\u2019t be. It hurts my elbow to move the bar. My volume pedal seems like it sits way higher than it should. I don\u2019t have a seat yet so I\u2019m just using an office chair and I\u2019m always worried I\u2019m just developing a bunch of bad habits. Picking/blocking is obviously hard, but at least that\u2019s something I\u2019m confident I can improve with a little more woodshedding. \n\nI\u2019d appreciate if any of you can share some experiences you had at a stage as early as mine, as well as anything you think I may be doing incorrectly/should change. \n\nTL;DR \u2014 This godforsaken instrument is way too awkward and I need to be told it gets better"

The Carfax states that it has had 4 total owners. The First dealership was a Toyota dealership, and it looks like they used this car for a fleet vehicle. At 10,000 miles, it was sold to the next dealership, and the second owner had it from 2007 until February of 2020. The third owner purchased it in March of 2020 and had it till November and the most recent dealership has had it since then. \n\nMy hesitation is this: why would the third dealer only own the car for 8 months before getting rid of it? Am I being TOO skeptical about the 4-owner thing? I've been wanting a 4runner for YEARS and want to make the right decision. Any insight would be great!!"

If this is you, and it sounds like we have something in common there, soylent designed for compete nutrition, a good way to go for you.\n\nSecond, there are a shitload of people who have very reduced diets.  It's VERY common in athletes.  Joe Rogan just had a guy on, who basically makes his own cheese pizza, and it's the primary source of his calories, pizza,,that's it, and he's a ripped geeky kid who just won some major martial arts competition.  Roy Calendar, a bodybuilder in the 70s, ate nothing but boiled chicken and raw eggs for months while making a cut for competition.  Likely half the US Olympic team have diets that make your last food selection look interesting and exciting.  My only concern would be heavy metal toxicity from too much tuna (high on mercury) or some vitamin or electrolyte deficiency.  But, you at least hit your macros, plenty of protein, plenty of complex carbs, maybe not enough fat unless your tuna was packed in olive oil, then you're fine.  I would suspect vitamin c deficiency, maybe b, and maybe e or k.  Plenty of vitamin A, and it's summer so D is likely fine.\n\nAnyway, your diet is by far not the weirdest doctors have ever seen.  Spaghetti with tuna as the protein?  Not that strange, just maybe switch to soylent if you don't want to do a ton of nutrition research.  You are fine.",

The present moment is likely going to be viewed, from the perspective of 22nd century historians, as the peak.  Why?  Well, you're not bright enough to figure this out, and I have to say, it's the 1970's and they want their overpopulation myth back, but, the point is, we are on precipice of a disaster that we've never seen before, population collapse.  It's already in motion, and causing severe pain in courntries like Japan, where 30% of the population is already over 65.  Whether or not it leads to anything beyond the worst economic disaster we've ever seen, well, time will tell, but it's not looking good.  No worries, the kids you never have will be there to take care of you.\n\nHow bad is it?  In the US, and we are by far not the worst off, we are 25% below replacement rate, expect the pain in about a decade.  Think about it this way, a dip in CONFIDENCE, not anything real, just, fucking confidence, is enough to send our stock market into a spin.  This is a dip in customers, about 25%, unprecedented, and it's across the board.  There will be no industry untouched by this, and guess what, social security, and other entitlement programs, were created, with the assumption that the population will continue to grow.  When I go to collect my check in a few decades, it will be the current population of workers paying for it.  What do you think happens when the population drawing the checks, is way bigger than the one paying in?  That's right, just as 401k's collapse, so will the backup, social security.  It's not just that the economy will go down, we have built all of this infrastructure, schools, roads, houses, with the assumption that there will be people using it.  So, we are going to have to destroy quite a bit of it, rather than maintain it.  It's such a waste.  Further, innovation happens because even though we aren't all Elon Musk, if we have enough people around, eventually someone is.  With less people, there will be less innovation.\n\nWhat's funny is we are headed for pain unlike we've ever seen, and we still have guys like you who equate solving this problem as \"a wasted life\".  lol, no, you're going to see what a waste looks like when things start heading south economically.  We're going to feel very stupid for undervaluing what is an essential part of continuing the species, yes, that's right, apparently propagating the species is necessary and essential, who knew?  At this point, we seem dangerously close to being too stupid and shortsighted to be compatible with life.\n\nEdit:  And we are somewhat in agreement that in an ideal world, we could all wait until 25 when our frontal lobes are fully developed.  But, have you seen what we do with those frontal lobes when we aren't having kids?  We say we are putting off these things because we are wise, and prudent.  Here's the reality, in the subconscious mind of every redditor under 30, is a helicopter parent, anxious, worrying, always telling the child to never take a risk, because the consequences will be catastrophic.  It's produced a population that completely understands the wisdom of waiting, but fails to understand that waiting too long, can be an even bigger disaster than any mistake you'll ever make.  That's what the studies are showing too, is that people raised by helicopter parents are anxious, and never completely grow up, afraid to risks, they end up missing out on their entire adult life, and all the joys life has to offer, because they are scared, which is why I feel a bit of sadness when I see the profile of a 40 year old woman who says she isn't ready to have kids.  She's literally missing out on her entire life if she applies that \"wisdom\" to the rest of her life.   \n There is no wisdom in saying that, only cowardice, a life unlived.  Unlike you, I feel a bit of relief, that some of us are still stupid enough to make a mistake every once in a while.",

Come up with an arbitrary age based rule, and they'll sidestep it without even thinking about it.  I watched a youtube video where they test a psychopaths intelligence.  He was average in all tests but one, \"Spot the victim.\".  It took him less than a second to spot a woman who had been victimized years earlier, out of a crowd of a couple dozen people walking down a crowded sidewalk.  He noticed one arm was moving out of sync with the rest her body.  That's the kind of 4D chess that those people can play, with a level of insight that you may never hear again, unless they are giving it to you.  But then again, we have a simple age based formula that requires all the sophistication of a 1st grade education to figure out.\n\nTo even say something like that out loud, that you think the number of years is going to make a difference, just draws sharks in.  I'm not saying you should ignore what you see, but actual predators are working on a level most can't fathom, and aren't operating on the level of conscious thought, they are looking at all the behavior you are doing that you aren't aware of.  As someone who has had to do a lot of therapy to figure out what made me such an easy victim, I can say, the easiest way to determine if you need to be more concerned, is look at your friends and family.  If they are victimized at a rate that is higher than average, then you need to figure out why that is.  Basically, when we are victimized, it dis-integrates us (much as the woman above was not moving her arm in sync with the rest of her body), so our thoughts don't match our words, which don't match our actions, etc.  That sort of thing opens us up to further exploitation, for reasons that unfortunately, can't be explained to 1st grader, because this is way harder of a problem than that.  \n\n\nEdit:  And, I usually hesitate to contribute here, not because I don't find the topics here interesting, but because I only have a few years of karma saved up, lol.  So, please go easy on me women of 2x, I enjoy seeing your perspectives, if nothing else.",

I mean, just because cats aren't to be trusted doesn't mean I don't think they are adorable.  I had a wiener dog that teleported through an interdimensional portal from hell into flawdogs animal rescue, and then into my unsuspecting arms.  \n\nHe was the kind of asshole that would take a piss on the floor, you would yell at him to stop pissing on the floor, and then he would turn back to look at you, as if he was annoyed that you interrupted a good piss, and KEEP PISSING. Then he would waive his white tipped tail (he was a black and tan piebald) victoriously, and trot away nonchalantly.  Then there was the chip incident where he just jumped up and snatched a nacho straight out of my cousin's hand right as he was about to take a bite.  This goes without mentioning all the squirrels, rabbits, and mice that he straight up murdered, no remorse.  I  rest assured that now little Scooby is sitting at the left hand of Satan where he belongs, thanks for letting me borrow your favorite dog, Satan.

I am 48, male (M4F), 5'11, 255 (losing weight currently targeting 210, yeah, have a large frame but still, it's been one of those years), blond hair (singular, kept short), hazel eyes, and a deep baritone voice that makes it sound like I know what I'm talking about.  I sing bass in choir at church, currently my only musical outlet, but also play guitar, piano, and have a degree in Music Composition (am a composer, have written a few dozen pieces in my 20's).  I also have a BS in Computer Science, and am 12 short of a 3rd degree in Biology), but I try not to let school get in the way of a good education.  I also have done a year of research in synthetic chemistry because I get bored easily.\n\nCurrently, I'm a senior firmware engineer working on medical devices, yes, it pays well.  I'm working on a breast pump next, no further comment necessary for this ENTP...  In my personal life, I am the proud owner of two rescue Dachshunds, Jamie and Snoopy.  I am theoretically financially solvent, but you never met my ex wife.  I live in a duplex, car paid off, and life has slowed down enough to where I am ready for more.  I am looking for someone who is Christian or who has values of that sort, is family oriented, and who wishes to find someone to settle down and have a family with.  I can also use penpals who are like-minded.\n\nThere's so much more I could write, but I'm an open book, so feel free to send me a line if you are interested."

                "body": "So, I went to walmart, bought an insulated bag, filled my gas to full for the first time since becoming unemployed 10 days ago, drove to my old stomping grounds to start taking orders, and toggled on that I'm accepting orders.  Mistake number one, I didn't know that grubhub locks into the region around where you live, and I was outside that region.  Since I had no orders after waiting twenty minutes, I started driving back to the region they have marked as my delivery area.  As soon as I got stuck on traffic, I got a notification for my first order.  \"Great!\", I think to myself, and I pulled into the nearest store so I could stop and see where I needed to pick up the order from, and where I would be taking it to before accepting it.  It took about 40 seconds from when the app alerted me, to stop, review it, and hit accept.  After doing so, it gave me no details, almost acting like I had hit reject, when I'm sure I hit accept.  So, I was too slow.  \n\nThe question I have is, I've been available for 90 minutes now, with no orders to show for it, in a busy market in an upscale part of a city of over 3 million.  Did I just destroy my acceptance rate by failing to hit accept in time?  I went ahead and scheduled a bunch of blocks to see if I have better luck during a scheduled block, but I'm wondering if I'm being penalized for not hitting accept immediately, does it show up as a reject in their system?\n\nEdit:  thank you so much for the responses.  Ironically, I accepted my first order right after I posted.  I've made enough to cover rent in the first 5 days, and overall its a nice change of pace from writing software, in that it involves some exercise, but not too much, and is a really good way to get to know the area I live, all the short cuts, restaurants, and neighborhoods.  I'm really enjoying the fast pace, and constant interaction with people so far, and I'm grateful we have this as a fast option to fill the gap when unemployed.  I can also see myself burning out, but, so far so good, I'm enjoying the honeymoon while it lasts."

I am marriage minded, family oriented, and basically looking for things that would have been easier to find at age 25, like someone to have children with, but I'm a bit of a procrastinator.\n\nNo worries, I'm experienced, was married before (to a very ambitious MD/Phd, no less), and can carry a conversation. I enjoy playing piano, writing, reading, listening to music, (writing music when I have time), writing software, walking my dog(s), watching mindless television, and generally have some kind of self improvement project or science experiment going at all times. Aside from that, if I had to write a book about my life,, there would be a lot of pages where the reader would say,\"He did what?!?\", so I'm a bit more exciting than what I wrote above, but at the same time, I clean up well. Ultimately, I would like to find a mature, intellectual woman who is spiritual/moral/ethical, has her shit together, and who is looking for the same things that I am.\n\nP.S. Oh yeah, almost forgot about the physical (typical ENTP, reality is an abstract concept for me). I am 5'11, 234, white (fluorescent if I don't get enough sun), bald (usually shave my head), hazel eyes, all my teeth, am told I look like I am 35 (which means despite my attempts at debauchery, my body has held up well). I carry my weight well and used to lift quite often."

Following this musical disaster, Eru went on maternity leave.\u00a0\n\nIn an effort to stop Melkor, now called Morgoth after being named so by the local goth F\u00ebanor because he wanted more goth music in the world, the store brand Edward, Bella and Jacob aka Beren, Luthien, and their dog, Speedy Gonzalez, broke into Morgoth\u2019s studio, promptly drugged everyone, trashed the place, and stole one of Morgoth\u2019s Chakra stones.\u00a0\n\nAfter Morgoth\u2019s imprisonment on charges of public exposure and indecency, his #1 fan, Sauron, god of looking suspiciously like an anti-semitic ambulance, attempted to copy Morgoth\u2019s style of music. This proved unsuccessful, so Sauron wrote \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen\u201d instead.\u00a0\n\nSauron, lord of ems, took up his femboy persona and distributed 19 copies of his composition to various locals. This included Galadriel, the local pick-me she-elf, who was dissatisfied with her purchase and vowed to stop Sauron, but not right now.\u00a0\n\nUpon hearing Sauron\u2019s opera, the Numenoreans, a society of Rockstars, decided to fight Eru, avid squirrel enthusiast, who promptly sank their floating studio, the Star Rock. Isildur, the sole survivor and bassist, vowed revenge on Sauron for this chain of events.\u00a0\n\nSauron, lord of ambulances, was briefly defeated by Isildur in a music/dance battle, Isildur perished shortly after he was found with the original recording of Sauron\u2019s music. The recording passed to supreme leader snoke\u2019s twin and fan of heavy metal, Iron Gollum. This didn\u2019t last long however as Bilbo, the vertically challenged, Baggins stole it and took it home.\u00a0\n\nGaladriel, after centuries of procrastination, formed the white council with some elves, such as Red Skull, and some choir boys, one of which looks suspiciously like a homophobic firetruck. They did nothing of importance.\u00a0\n\nAfter the discovery of Sauron\u2019s opera in Bilbo\u2019s home, Gandalf, a choir boy and COPD patient, sent it to Red Skull\u2019s domain. The recording was carried by Frodo, Bilbo\u2019s father\u2019s brother\u2019s nephew\u2019s cousin\u2019s former roommate.\n\nAfter Frodo was attacked by one of Sauron\u2019s cultish fanboys, Frodo plus some friends made it to Imladris, which roughly translates to Vormir (pronounced vomit). After many unnecessary shareholder meetings and what could have been emails, Frodo and 8 others set off to Sauron\u2019s studio to destroy the tape recording in the only tape shredder in the universe.\u00a0\n\nAfter walking for an obscene amount of time, the nine were attacked by a hentai protagonist, The Voyeur of Water. This creature is one of the unknown things created by Ainur Pitchiness. This excludes Tom Bombadil, who was obviously created by the sheer power of Queen Varda\u2019s soprano high C. She is the director\u2019s favorite but like she can\u2019t even dance or act!"

It says \u300c\u3046\u3064\u305b\u307f\u306e\u3000\u4ee3\u3005\u6728\u306e\u91cc\u306f\u3000\u3057\u3065\u304b\u306b\u3066\u3000\u90fd\u306e\u307b\u304b\u306e\u3000\u3053\u3053\u3061\u3053\u305d\u3059\u308c\u300d  \nFrom what I understand, it roughly means \"The peace/quiet of Yoyogi Village of Utsusemi -- other city -- here -- to be made\"\n\nMy Japanese is only limited to intermediate understanding of modern Japanese , so I'm not entirely sure what the second half of the sentence means.

That amber finish is so nice and I want a desktop to use a whip with it later this year too. Thanks guys!"

I tend to dig into myself with my razor because I get hyperfixated about it. It sucks because my face does best best shaving with cold water to close up the pores and create a smooth base for the razor, but I need the hot shower for my sugar scrub. Then I get some bumps and a rashiness that I have to hide with makeup. In the late evening I do see some hairs poking through, usually because makeup makes it obvious af. Right now I feel razor burn fro shaving half an hour ago and I'm just sick of that feeling.\n\nI feel like I just need to get a decent shave in the morning to deal with texture and then maybe touch up in the evenings if I have somewhere to be. Epilating would probably wreck me and home lasers probably won't do shit. I'm looking for something under $200 since that's about what I spend in shaving every year.\nThanks!"

Considering we've both arrived at it, I take it to mean we won't get to a very clear answer without the release of Fontaine, Natlan, and Snezhnaya and their archon quests.\n\nMy line of thought was rather simple in finding that common theme between all characters of an element. Once again though, with such varied characters with various motivations it proves to be a complicated endeavor. On the bright side though, it doesn't seem to restrict the writers and let's the characters be unique for the better. Depending on what factors included/excluded when considering an element's ideal could also change the interpretation of ideals. Such as if these same ideals apply to how enemies use elements, how the traveler navigates the story in each nation, or whether the traveler resonating with an element denotes an ideal. I'd think if the theory had to resort to these factors though, It'd be like searching for a pattern that isn't there in the first place.\n\nIt doesn't help too much that visions are the crux of the theory when the details of how they're given and who is considered to get one is so obfuscated, especially masterless visions. For one, the moment in an individual receives one is dependent on if they have a display of the ideal that vision's element represents. But for those such as Ningguang or Mona, since they awakened nasterless visions, could that be taken to mean they would've gotten a whole new vision at some point as well? Is the masterless vision one of the many situations where an ideal is tested or diplayed? Could it also be taken to mean any great display of ideal is a chance for a vision, as long as the gods take notice? Is the gods taking notice a requirement for awakening a masterless vision?\n\nKazuha's situation within the Inazuma archon quest could make some points clearer if there were more cases of characters awakening masterless visions. The electro vision of his deceased friend briefly activated when Kazuha's ideal aligned with that of his friends, to \"brave the lightning's glow\", albeit only for that moment in parrying the Shogun, then deactivating after. Ningguang's own vision story also states \"[a masterless vision] may resonate with another - and only one such \"other\" at a time... \" stating a vision is unable to resonate with two people at once. While the following is my own speculation, I take it to also mean a person can resonate with only one vision for the extended period of time they own one, for at least a human's lifespan.\n\nTogether these imply that to awaken a masterless vision, the ideal of the awakener must at least align generally with that of the element's ideal, and at the most match the exact ideal in a situation in which said ideal would manifest as the same within the previous owner. In both cases though, the ideal must match the element the vision corresponds to. It's also not stated directly, but in addition to this, it is likely one resonating with a vision must also continue carrying that ideal. Though seeing as it's believed by some that a vision is a physical manifestation of ambition, constantly carrying it on your person likely satisfies the second point.",

My own interpretation more or less come from linking characters within the same element and what their core fundamental trait is, along with the archon and nation, and going from there. For my electro, I rather focused on Ei pursuing eternity, what's called as the heavenly principle closest to the Celestia, along with Inazuma's government based around the power of clans, and one's position within that clan.\n\nWhat the ideals may be could also have been why the nations grapple with a certain problem (Mondstat - limiting of freedom, choice forcibly taken. Liyue - shakeup of traditional rule and protection that lasted centuries. Inazuma - a power struggle within the system and behind the scenes. Sumeru - the monopolization of knowledge.)\n\nI have much to go through as well, because I know for certain there is a whole world's worth of lore to comb through, especially with unreleased nations and archons. My Cryo is certainly the least established.\n\nNevertheless, it's for sure a very fun idea and thought experiment to toy with!",

In addition to this, if it was the inteded route that visions represent an ambition within an individual, it's very possible earlier characters such as 1.Xs are in a grey area while future characters have it more fleshed out.\n\nAs for what is known though, if we take archons as the ultimate wielder of their element, or also with the most of their respective ambition, along with the ideals of the nation they lead, the 7 ideals pan out as:\n\nAnemo - Freedom (whether as the way they conduct themselves, literal freedom, or unrestrained in their range of action)\n\nGeo - Pride (ranges from faith, to tradition, in oneself, or even in others)\n\nElectro - Status (in relation to actual positions of power, a defining achievement, or if a character's defining quality is their place within a system)\n\nDendro - Wisdom (straight up knowledge related, whether already incredibly wise or placing great importance on the accumulation of more knowledge)\n\nHydro - Tranquility (less defined, this refers to how one would ideally handle life, challenges, situations, and opposition with a cool, calm, and collected manner through actions or personality)\n\nPyro - Exertion (through competition, being the best in field, doing their best work, or against a force within the world)\n\nCryo - Duty (commitment to one's craft, profession, or study. Also in reference to commitment to goals)\n\nOf course, it'll be more defined or decomfirmed as time goes on. I also feel this gets horoscope-y and could fall into the Barnum effect quickly. Though with these being characters in a game that could well be inspired by archetypes or tropes, and the creation of these characters are made with a defining quality in mind, the theory has something to stand on in that regard.",

You have to be blind if you don\u2019t see how poverty is rising everywhere for the many because ultra wealthy business owners and landlords are squeezing as much as they possibly can out of us. That\u2019s how increasing profit margins work. Have you ever wondered exactly where all that wealth came from that western nations have accumulated under capitalism? By exploiting the third world for their resources and deliberately keeping them in poverty and dependent on us (not to mention also very purposefully interfering with any attempts that workers in those countries make to seize the means of production and improve their living conditions; the CIA has openly admitted to this). We\u2019re not the good guys, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re the ones writing the history books. If you yourself are a worker and not a capital owner with the keys to the factory, then you\u2019ve been duped by the status quo and its propaganda. It\u2019s a hard pill to swallow, but it\u2019s true.\n\nThe opposite of capital owners owning the means of production is the workers owning the means of their labor and its production (socialism). People who write articles like the one you sent me deliberately will conflate socialism with government overreach, as if we just need to concentrate the power in the hands of the \u201cright\u201d person, when in reality the most empowered thing you can do as a worker is to advocate for yourself through direct action such as unionizing. Or workers starting cooperative businesses where the labor value is shared *amongst the workers who actually created it* instead of having the top increasingly skimmed off by your boss who I can quite literally guarantee doesn\u2019t work as hard as you or your coworkers.\n\nHere is a decent video for people unfamiliar with socialism, so I suggest you learn about it before dismissing something you\u2019ve probably been purposefully misinformed on:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thJ2ocejPko",

Lawmakers get absolutely insane amounts of money both publicly and anonymously via donations from the extremely wealthy, not just in the US but from anyone from foreign nations who has enough wealth. It\u2019s the corporate capital owners who really hold the highest keys to power under capitalism, not our elected officials. Politicians are just a tool for the highest bidder to buy influence over everyone\u2019s resources while putting on a show to pretend that our electoral process is fair and representative of the voters\u2019 interests. Politicians sure do love to take home those donations, and big companies sure do love the generous tax cuts and bailouts that they get in return, so both parties are happy with this mutual relationship. Why else do you think both democrats and republicans are so against common sense policy that the majority of American workers want, like pro-labor legislation or sustainability initiatives? Because it directly threatens capital owners\u2019 insane amounts of wealth.\n\nAnd btw I\u2019m not eluding to increased government oversight and spending being the solution. Our options aren\u2019t only big gov or big corporate. Under socialism (workers owning the means of their labor and production instead of capital owners owning it), we can approach it bottom-up, not just top-down through increased government control or social welfare programs. I believe in power being a corrupting force, so I don\u2019t like to see it get more concentrated in either the hands of business owners nor government officials. Not to say that I\u2019m completely against certain government regulation obviously, it\u2019s a compromise for the time being since it\u2019s more humanely designed than if certain things are privatized and so it\u2019s not a negative on a smaller scale, but as you\u2019ve laid it out you can see that it\u2019s a bandaid and not a long term solution that fixes our deeper problems. We achieve more fairness and transparency when workers seize control of their labor more directly rather than through our elected officials. This looks like things such as increasing labor unions, more co-ops as a business model, and a society becoming more focused on mutual aid rather than becoming increasingly more atomized and isolated as we have been becoming for decades.\n\nSo it\u2019s not about treating things as \u201crights\u201d rather than commodities. I\u2019m saying that when workers have control over the means of production, *we* get the say over how the resources we produced are allocated without also having to keep feeding the unsustainably growing monster that is chasing higher and higher profits. Chasing higher profits is why workers get shafted and treated more poorly, because again the point is to squeeze us as much as possible for the sake of increasing those profit margins. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d agree that your hospital would have better staffing and give better care if you and your coworkers were treated better with fairer pay and sustainable shift scheduling.\n\nWe live on a planet with finite resources trying to justify an exploitative system that demands from us infinite resources. Capitalism had its time in the sun as an improvement to feudalism, but now it\u2019s time to retire it and move on to something that prioritizes humanity and sustainable growth instead.",

Everyone other than him is stupid and they don't know what they are talking about, therefore their opinions and knowledge are invalid. He has low empathy, but understands that he he can upset people by being insensitive to their feelings. He doesn't get upset easily as the concerns of others are simply brushed off as the other party is either too stupid or sensitive to be taken seriously. If they are insistent he is in the wrong and they bring proof, they are still wrong because they don't remember his argument / actions / intentions correctly.  \n\nI live with him as I am now his permanent caregiver. Over time I've learned to set boundaries regarding me and my thoughts / identity but also within what I will allow to be used in an argument. I've found that the Moving the Goalpost Fallacy is a favorite for him. I've also learned how to deter guilt-trips and emotional manipulation by calling them out when I see them. With time, I've learned how to hold him responsible to the words or ideas he claims are 'right', break them down one by one and keep him relatively honest in his arguments (I still don't know how to argue against gaslighting attempts beyond throwing them out, but establishing what we *both* \"know\" helps to keep the argument grounded). When I 'Win' the argument, there seems to be no true correction to his thought process tho. It just ends with him claiming thats what he was saying the whole time and the whole argument was for nothing. Claiming, as he laughs, that I only wanted to argue about something so insignificant because I'm irritable and overly sensitive about him always being 'Right'. \n\nIt's infuriating. \n\nNow... I have also seen him in his rawest form of insecurity. His ego relies on being the smartest in the room. Anyone who thinks differently is obviously too stupid to see that he's right (including experts such as Doctors). But with all that said, I don't think he is a bad person. He had a rough upbringing with an uneducated mother who was a combo of emotionally manipulative and neglectful and father who thought my dad was too stupid to love. So I understand easily how his entire personality is essentially a defense mechanism, but, isn't that also the foundation of narcissism itself? A gold plated suit of armour hiding an underdeveloped psyche? \n\nI wouldn't argue he is cruel or abusive, but his inability to see any faults within himself or accept me as a person beyond being an extension of himself has severely fucked with my own psychological development (especially in regards to my own identity and self-confidence). \n\nOr is it just me? Am *I* the one who's holding him to an impossible moral standard by expecting him to be someone I can trust instead of just recognizing that he's flawed like the rest of us? \n\nI mean, why can't I just let him live in peace?\n \nWhy do I have this need to call him out?\n\nWhat am I even trying to prove?\n\nReally, who am I to speak? \n\nAm I being needlessly cruel to try and strip someone of their defense mechanisms for nothing other than my own self-esteem?\n\nAm *I* the narcissist?"

And I don't necessarily mean 'in the bedroom,' but I'm not excluding it either lol.\n\nEver since I could remember I have been obsessed with the idea of identity, especially how people can be so certain about their own. To me the idea of identity has always seemed so abstract and almost fluid.\n\nSpecifically focusing on the subtle difference between 'knowing' who you are vs. the persona that others attribute to 'you'?\n\n*[Christopher Nolan's Memento does a really good job demonstrating this point.]*\n\nI never miss a chance to dress up or try new styles that make me feel like a different person. I also absolutely LOVE subverting expectations of those who 'think' they know 'me'. For example, they've only seen one side of my personality and assume I'm meek and quiet, then boom I turn around, complete 180, and I'm a loud and confident version of whoever the fuck I want to be.\n\nEither way, I attribute this line of thinking / fascination with identity to the intrinsic INFJ mix of having low sense of self with highly empathic Fe paired with the exploratory Se. I also assume it could be linked to Enmeshment Trauma as well, but that is also something I assume to be a typical INFJ experience.\n\nAnyone else like this?? or maybe know if this is typical of certain types?"

Anyways, I have been thinking about enrolling into a 2 year college program and I am having some worries about how well I'll do in my classes. I know I can't let this condition halt my life, but sometimes I still feel so mentally foggy and it's difficult to focus on new information. I made it through a 4 year program before, but that was before my symptoms really began. Has anyone made it through school while they were still struggling with symptoms? I am trying to decide if I should just go for it or if I should take more time to figure out the diet that works best for me that helps to improve my focus issues. I am a smart person but sometimes this all really makes me feel dumb!  The program I am considering involves mostly anatomy, physiology, and clinical practicums. Although I am interested, I am wondering if I'll retain any of the information. \n\nThank you for reading. I was wondering if anyone has been able to embark upon a new career while still dealing with some symptoms. How did you manage? Did it go okay? I am starting to worry about how much of my life is going to have to revolve around this illness."

                "body": " Here is my situation:\n\n I went to a coding bootcamp to get a job and make more than 12 an hour 9-5 everyday. My parents (who are pretty well off) paid 20k for me to do the camp a few months ago. I've been looking for a job since April, applying to tons of jobs, working with my career advisor on making sure my resume/portfolio is all good. Sounds all good right? Well its not, my parents like tons of other parents have a expectation for me, realistic/unrealistic as well.\n\nI've been known to move from thing to thing (im 20 btw), esports(got super depressed and quit) I tried acting and took a break, tried to be a professional freerunner(got injured)  joined the navy wanting to become a navy seal (didnt score high enough and dropped out of dep). All this while working 9-5 everyday cleaning to pay rent alone in a $900 studio apt ( i alone moved from nj to pa after high school, this is all within the span of 2 years).\n\nI was tired of being micro managed in a business run by my uncle , depressed, working to pay rent with my aspirations dying. I thought let me ask my mommy to pay for me to go to school (she gave me the ultimatum to either move out or go to school after the summer ended.) I finally took her up on that deal and chose to do a coding bootcamp because I'm a pc gamer and \"computer stuff\" is what I'm good at. I finished it I'm actually pretty good at coding web dev!  : )  It wasn't easy and I was burnt out afterwards but I finally finished something for once.\n\nCovid happen during April and in between that time I was trying acting again and somehow got into modeling. I modeled for a friends company and am actively trying to get more modeling gigs while Im procrastinating my Acting but I'm working on it lol. \n\nSince starting acting at 18 and then taking a break for a year and a half I can say it's the thing I definitely want to do and wouldn't mind being paid for it, so the feeling of work isn't there. I realised being \"internet famous\" is a very legible thing for me personally, so I'm slowly but passively going into all those avenues (tiktok, youtube, twitch(i streamed for 3 months before i stopped and went to the coding bootcamp)). \n\nI've been living with my parents since bootcamp ended.\n\nIssue here being, my parents who just paid around 18k for me to go to school, don't like that I'm spending more time talking and putting more effort into finding more acting/modeling jobs. I haven't stopped applying for coding jobs at all, I do at least 15-20 a week. I usually don't get a response, other than an occasional email saying *no go away* (paraphrasing). I think the issue my parents are having is that it looks like I am not doing anything to get a job, anything to increase my odds at least, unlike the acting and modeling. I'm aware I should be making apps, emailing people/networking to employers, finding a recruiter, freelancing(honestly afraid of this I would otherwise do it, being a one man business in a business i have no experience in when it comes to making sure i dont mess up something business wise is scary as hell) \n\nSo I decided to just apply to jobs and eventually get one, I'm applying to all LA jobs as a front end developer so I can get a job in an area I can network and make more \"influencer friends\" in. This time living alone I'll be making a median salary of 100k entry level. So I can at least save and not feel like if I lose my job I'm dead. Finding a job in both areas I'm aware is incredibly hard at the moment and is definitely factoring in.\n\nCurrently I'm working 30-35hours a week as a salesman in the tourist area I live in, saving for a motorcycle since it would be more cost/traffic efficient in LA.\n\nThe only issue I can see thats making my parents freak out on me whenever I'm home, is that I don't have a coding job yet, I'll mention acting/modeling to them(they see it as the same as saying oh my god to an evangelical christian family) when it comes into conversation, I'm not trying hard enough to find a coding job.\n\nTLDR: Parents paid for schooling to find a coding job, applying to jobs but not trying very hard to get one. Acting/modeling is my passion. Currently working fulltime. Parent's angry I don't have a job yet. Covid is also happening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I missing something here that I'm not considering matters more than I think? \n\nIs what I'm doing ok but the way I'm going about it is getting me in trouble?\n\nAm I an asshole that's just feeding off my parents?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease be 100% honest, even if it's not advice just some outward opinion on how it looks."

New guy whos down for the summer, worked here last year and now again, he would be the person who observes the conversation and waits for a moment to chime in. Except when he does its just to make the other person look stupid. I'm normally ok with people doing this especially when its funny and light-hearted but he takes it too far when it comes to how our workspace normally is. I dont enjoy being called retarded, stupid, or any actual insults when I dont know you and am never friendly with you. I'm guy 19 the dude is 20 with a reseeding hair line(not to call out anyone that does but this guy just struck a nerve). It feels like high school BS.

For each potential supervisor, you should include a brief paragraph describing why you are interested in their research.\" Does this mean it should be relatively brief and stick only to what I want to research and who my three ideal supervisors would be? Or do I hit them with my life story and why I love science etc.? Am I overthinking this? Do we exist just to suffer?\n\nThanks guys."

I live in Western Canada during the Winter and Eastern Canada during the summers, so generally dealing with either cold, wet, or both.\n\n3. I'm athletic and like to push myself and my gear hard.\n\nLeaning towards the Theta AR for the durability which is a bonus considering my aggressive ski style, though I am concerned the heavier face fabric will make it uncomfortable to wear in less demanding environments. I have the impression the packability of the Theta AR is also significantly lower than the Beta LT.\n\nI know a unicorn hardshell doesn't exist, mostly just looking to hear any of your experiences or opinions regarding these two products.

It's by far my favorite archetype, and the main reason I picked up the mod.\n\nYou can ignore most of the Conjuration spells, until you hit a level of reduction that makes them mostly free. They don't count towards the summon limit, so they're better *alongside* regular summons instead of in place of them.\n\nThe Alteration spells are situationally fun. A lot of people build around the Force of Nature spell, but I only ever really used Wildshape and Chase The Horizon.\n\nThe Restoration spells are *really* good, though. Parasitic Growth and Bramble Growth *seem* to stack, so even tanky enemies end up being drained pretty quickly, and the Goodberries are better than healing potions most of the time. And the auras spirits are very useful, especially since they affect your summons.\n\nI like to combine them with the Shaman spells. The offensive Restoration shaman spells can really help when your enemies are resistant to poison. And the totems they summon pack a punch against groups of enemies.",

He ran circles around Shen and Zed, but they're not investigators. Caitlyn has a hard time with Jinx because Jinx doesn't have a methodology, she just does what she wants. Jhin is compulsive, and has a pattern and MO. I think Caitlyn could nab him.\n\nAshe and Sejuani, I think, are the pair with the least clear answer. The lore depicts them as equals, each seemingly the spiritual successor (if not a flat out reincarnation) of 2 of the 3 sisters from Freljord's legendary past. Both are skilled in their chosen form of combat, but their biggest strengths come from leadership. I also doubt we'll see this one answered- the warring between Freljord's tribes will likely culminate in the Avarosans and Winter's Claw (and maybe Lissandra) joining forces against the Watchers.",

Everyone is naturally transmitting psionic energy, and telepaths can pick it up. The more experience or power you have as a telepath, the more you're able to manipulate the psionic energy around you and even dim your own awareness of it. And even non-telepaths can learn to suppress their psionic output (which is how I interpret psychic resistance).",

                "body": "I know this has been done before, but I'm bored and it's in my head so I thought I'd add my 2 cents. :)\n\nAries: R+B/G: I think most of the fire signs (and even some of the water signs) are going to find themselves with Red as their primary color. Fire signs are known for their passion and being the most active signs of the zodiac, and Aries is the poster child for both. As the first sign of the zodiac, Aries is also known for being a little self-absorbed- not necessarily out of narcissism or malice, but because they're about being active and doing what makes the most sense to them. This implies Black (who is interested in the self) and/or Green (who just follows its nature) to me.\n\nTaurus: G+W/B: Taurus is known for being laidback and dependable, but also materialistic and lazy. They don't feel the need to *try* as hard as the rest of the zodiac, which feels very Green to me. Their taste for the finer things in life and their own comfort would give them Black, but Taurus that focus more on tradition and their responsibilities may have more White to them.\n\nGemini: B+U/R: Gemini, and air signs in general, want to understand the world. Gemini does so by experiencing as much as possible. This means they're likely to be Blue, but Gemini is focused on *their* experience. It's about what Gemini can get out of it, which seems Black to me. Despite the negative stereotypes for both Gemini and B/Grixis this doesn't make them evil. They just have an ambition, and how they choose to follow that ambition could make them more Blue or Red.\n\nCancer: W+R/G: Often referred to as the \"Mother of the Zodiac,\" Cancer is concerned for the wellbeing of everyone around them. Taking care of others is their nature, and that makes them primarily White IMO. As a water sign they can be especially emotional, which adds a touch of Red, and because they tend to look at the big picture they may have a touch of Green.\n\nLeo: B+R/W: Leo often get a bad reputation as narcissists, but in my experience they just *really* want to be liked. I think this leads them to Black, as Black also wants to be liked (as it gives them a form of social power). As a fire sign, Leo are *passionate*, and that makes me consider them Red. But Leo has a very specific understanding of hierarchy and discipline, which could give them a dash of White.\n\nVirgo: W+U/B: Virgo are the planners of the zodiac. They want to account for everything, and make sure things are running smoothly- for themselves and the people around them. Maybe more than any other zodiac sign, they embody a dual color (W/U), but I find them primarily White. The Black can often manifest because they always think they know best.\n\nLibra: G+W/U: Libra are the scales of the zodiac, they want to create *harmony* in their environment. Sound familiar? That seems very Green to me! They care about the wellbeing of everyone around them, or at least how it impacts the rest of the group, which feels very White. And as an air sign they want to understand the *why* people act against their own harmony in order to find an ideal solution, which feels very Blue.\n\nScorpio: U+R/B: Scorpio get a bad rep, but they're a loyal sign. They're a sign known to observe and understand, but keep a lot to themselves. This seems Blue to me, but combined with their natural empathy throws in Red. The Black comes from their willingness to put themselves first- maybe more than any other water sign, Scorpio refuses to deal with the messy drama of other signs. This self-reliance seems Black to me.\n\nSaggitarius: R+G/U: Saggitarius is the philosopher of the zodiac. Like Gemini, it looks to understand by experiencing. But Sag puts more emphasis on external experience, *doing* over thinking. That's very Red. The authenticity of their nature gives them some Green, while their curious nature makes them Blue.\n\nCapricorn: B+W/R: Capricorn are the sign known for ambition. They pretty much embody Black mana as a whole already. But they can also be traditional and inflexible, reflecting White, while hiding a passionate and fanciful side to themselves, reflecting Red.\n\nAquarius: U+B/G: Aquarius is known for being inquisitive. They want to understand the world around them, embodying Blue mana. They often get stuck in their own ambitions, reflecting Black, but they care for the effects of the world around them, reflecting Green.\n\nPisces: R+U/G: Pisces are known for their imagination and creativity, which reflects Red but also often combines with Blue for many of Pisces more stereotypical traits. The Green comes from the holistic nature of Pisces, trying to reconcile reality with fantasy.\n\nThis is my list, feel free to disagree and discuss (politely)!"

I decided to get back into LoR recently, but I've been pretty exclusively focused on Path of Champions (for context, I first got into the game when Ahri was released and played a bit, then fell out of it and haven't played till recently). Everything was going fine for me at first. I prefer aggro and spellslinger strats in MtG, so Jinx's playstyle came naturally to me. I also unlocked LeBlanc and facerolled through some of the paths with her. I also got Lux and, while I don't like her as much as LeBlanc or Jinx, I've completed the Demacia quests with her.\n\nBut now I'm hitting the 2-3 star quests that require me to play champs from specific regions. From what I can tell, resources you can use to unlock new champs are limited and tied to completing quests. I unlocked Illaoi, since I needed a Bilgewater champ to complete one of the quests and I had Illaoi shards. But I kind of hate Illaoi's deck. It's so slow, it accrues value very slowly, and it has a lot of expensive cards that just can't keep up with the path challenges.\n\nDoes anybody have any tips on how to beat Viktor's path with Illaoi? Or is there a way I could unlock MF without completing a quest? Any and all help would be really appreciated!"

I think that makes it safe to assume we're getting *a lot* more than just the Paladin class. We'll know for sure what we're getting 5 days from now, but until then, I'm excited for the possibilities!\n\nThe Paladin is all but officially confirmed. The Panel From Hell name (\"A Holy Knight\") and the holy warrior in the games award trailer is pretty much confirmation.\n\nWith the Paladin, I imagine we'll get a few new spells. The Smite spells we haven't gotten yet seem likely. Maybe Spiritual Weapon? They usually give us a few new spells to play with after a patch.\n\nDifferent body sizes also feels likely, given the muscular Barbarian PC shown in the trailer. In the very least I'll be surprised if we don't get the muscular body type.\n\nGetting less likely, perhaps new PC races? Half-orc? Maybe Dragonborn? Despite having dialogue tags, I'm not sure datamining has found anything for their models, meshes, and textures. Entirely new stuff like that could warrant a larger patch size?\n\nAnd the thing I find least likely, level 5. Maybe I'm taking too many images from the new trailer as hints instead of just marketing, but we saw a *lot* of 3rd level spells in the trailer. Fly, Lightning Bolt, Fireball. Level 5 comes with a lot of new spells and abilities, the inclusion of which could also account for the large patch size.\n\nFinally, a new area? I don't know how likely this is. I feel like they've been pretty clear that limiting Early Access is intentional, and Grymforge was a huge addition I certainly didn't expect. And, based solely on the story beats we've gotten in EA, I don't know where they'd let us go from here. I can't see them giving us Moonrise Tower this early."

Still, it seems like a good idea to stay informed about other people's perceptions of me. So tell me, what colors do you see?\n\n**1. Is it better to give everyone equal opportunity, rather than equal wealth?**\n\nThis is a tricky question without context. Both would be good, but without an idea of *how* you'd accomplish either it's kind of an unanswerable question for me.\n\n**2. Do you think that people are responsible to themselves first and foremost?**\n\nAbsolutely. Look out for you and yours, because there is no guarantee someone else will look out for you.\n\n**3. Should we guide ourselves by our feelings, and pursue our wildest dreams?**\n\nWe should take our feelings into account, but never let them be the sole deciding factor. \n\n**4. Is it more important to have a better plan than a better execution?**\n\nWhen it comes to plans, I prefer outlines that allow for flexibility and improv. I think that puts me in the execution camp?\n\n**5. Are we directly responsible for our successes and failures?**\n\nProbably the majority of them, but don't ignore the effect environment and opportunity have on any outcome. There are no *true* self-made billionaires, after all.\n\n**6. Do our lives have a higher purpose or meaning?**\n\nNo. We're here to live, to experience, and eventually, to die. In my opinion, that's already a pretty divine experience we've been given.\n\n**7. Is human nature, generally speaking, good?**\n\nNo, but I don't believe in an overarching \"human nature\" either. I think what truly separates humanity from the other animals of the earth is the variety in temperament and behavior you'll find even in our own small social circles. \n\n**8. Should individuals give up some of their rights and freedoms for safety in society at large?**\n\nSure, but the punishment we dole out needs to match the crime. There are people still rotting in jail for drug possession, despite the fact they've never hurt anyone, and that doesn't sit right with me.\n\n**9. Is there any point in trying to do more than what's good enough?**\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, sure. But you won't find me doing extra for no additional incentives.\n\n**10. Do you believe that some parts of ourselves are too inherent to ever be changed?**\n\nNo. I think it's harder to change certain parts of ourselves, but never impossible that we be better (or worse) if we choose to be.\n\n**11. Do you think we should improve ourselves before improving the world?**\n\nI don't think we need to choose just one or the other. Both take time and energy, but neither need to be dedicated to a single thing all at once. \n\n**12. In our society, is stability more important than advancement?**\n\nAdvancement brings stability. Stability leads to opportunity for advancement.\n\n**13. Do you see passing on your knowledge to others as detrimental to yourself?**\n\nAbsolutely not. When people are better informed, they can make better decisions because of that. I benefit from other's making better decisions.\n\n**14. When doing a task, is it more important to have dedication, rather than information?**\n\nLike I said, you make better decisions when you're better informed. Information all day.\n\n**15. Do you think delayed gratification is worth the wait?**\n\nAs someone with ADHD, I struggle with being impulsive. But when I'm able to control those impulses, I typically have a better and less stressful time when I practice discipline and self-restraint.\n\n**16. Which is better, freedom or power?**\n\nThey're the same thing.\n\n**17. Do you value expressing yourself to those around you more than you value introspecting and growing as a person?**\n\nI'm a diehard introvert, but this surprises people who have only seen me at social events. I think most people would be better off if they spent more time reflecting on themselves.\n\n**18. Would you prefer living in harmony with the world around you, or free and unconstrained by it?**\n\nWhat does this mean? Why can't I do both? \n\n**19. Is benevolence more important than understanding in a good society?**\n\nBenevolence without understanding is empty and performative. Like a \"social media influencer\" who needs to record their good deeds is benevolent, but they don't understand the problem with their actions.\n\n**20. Do you think societies that forget about their culture and origins will be unsuccessful?**\n\nSocieties that look to the future without letting the past inform them are doomed. \n\n**21. Do you agree that one of the greatest threats we - society as a whole - must deal with is the rampant individualism that results in people harming one another?**\n\nIf by \"individualism\" you mean greed, yes. If by \"individualism\" you mean people pushing back against cultural norms that have kept them from being themselves for the majority of their lives, no.\n\n**22. Do you agree that one of the most dangerous pitfalls we face is complacency - thinking that there is a point where further improvement is either impossible or unnecessary?**\n\nYes. You can see it on small and large scales. People who feel powerless to act, so they do nothing.\n\n**23. Do you agree that one of the easiest ways to end up with an unsuccessful and unhappy life is to be beholden to others - to serve the interests of the group and the community while ending up neglecting your own?**\n\nI can't imagine anything worse than a life trying to please everyone around you without taking time for yourself. \n\n**24. Do you agree that one of the worst things that can happen to us is to forget to experience and enjoy life and all it has to offer, instead finding ourselves caught up in the details?**\n\nYes. Enjoy what is while it is, because everything changes eventually. \n\n**25. Do you agree that one of the most saddening aspects of the modern world is the overabundance of dishonesty, manipulation and hidden agendas meant to create conflict and disunity?**\n\nIs it sad? Sure. Is it a product of modern times? Not in the slightest. \n\n**26. Do you agree that one of the biggest failures of modern-day society is thinking in terms of the group, forgetting that each and every one of us are individuals, unique and with personal ambitions?**\n\nI feel the only place I see this is politics, where a person's political party becomes their whole outlook and they can't even criticize it without being ostracized. I don't see this in my social groups.\n\n**27. Do you agree that one of the easiest ways to end up with an unfulfilling and unhappy life is to refuse to listen to what your heart and gut tell you?**\n\nTo a point. There are abuse victims who know they should leave their abusers but never do because they love them, after all.\n\n**28. Do you agree that one of the most important concepts people should learn is responsibility - understanding that everyone has a duty to be good to one another?**\n\nI've always held the viewpoint that I'll be good/polite to someone until they give me reason not to be. No need to go out of your way to make enemies.\n\n**29. Do you agree that members of a society should partake in a collective effort for progress in the long term, even if it means sacrificing the individual\u2019s desires in the short term?**\n\nWell, yeah. It's gonna benefit me, too. Just don't expect me to take the lead. \n\n**30. Do you agree that power is needed for a successful life, and that the best way to get it is through constant innovation?**\n\nInnovation may be a form of power, but it isn't the only path. As for success, staying adaptable is the key.\n\n**31. Is knowledge acquired by directly experiencing the world for yourself, rather than by analyzing it as a puzzle, where each piece fits in a certain spot?**\n\nAssuming there is only one \"right\" path in the pursuit of knowledge is a trap. Any experience can be a learning experience.\n\n**32. Should relationships with others be built on authentic feelings, or because it's important for everyone to have the right social connections in order to succeed?**\n\nI'm not going to surround myself with people I can't stand, but I'm also not going to burn bridges with someone who could get me what I want.\n\n**33. Do you prefer having a slow and steady lifestyle, over a fast-paced, innovative one?**\n\nI like being able to take time for myself, so slow and steady will win my race.\n\n**34. Should you focus on taking advantage of the imperfect system that exists, instead of striving for a perfect one that might never exist?**\n\nYou can do both. In fact, taking advantage of an imperfect system is one of the best ways to find flaws in it.\n\n**35. Do you think people become successful in a field because of the discipline they use in channeling their passion, or because of their determination and desire to improve their skills?**\n\nIf you don't have the passion, where do you get the determination?\n\n**36. Personally, I'd like to be more** *influential*, **even if that meant I was less** *organized*.\n\n**37. Out of these, I want to** *discover myself* **the most.**\n\n**38. Out of these, I don\u2019t want to** *die forgotten* **the most.**\n\n**39. People, in general, should try to be more** *accepting*.\n\n**40. People, in general, should try to be less** *rigid*."

I'd wager the above descriptors are a big reason Black can't shake its past.\n\nBut suppose we refocus Black's philosophy into Individualism? In that case, we open up the color's philosophy to be more on par with the rest of the color pie (who have philosophies that don't slant towards a good or bad, but remain neutral). As I imagine everyone here knows, Individualism is already a part of Black's wheelhouse. Because of that making it the focus of Black's philosophy won't change the overall philosophy in ways that make it unrecognizable.\n\nAs the color of individualism, it remains opposed to White and Green, the colors that care most about community. As the color of individualism it remains allied to Blue and Red, who value Black's self-determination (but for different reasons). It retains the selfish aspects of its philosophies, the ambition associated with it, but those qualities don't become the focus anymore.

I know this gets brought up semi-regularly, but that just seems like a further reason to consider it.\n\nHer passive simply isn't cohesive to her kit, feeling tacked on. It also doesn't fit her lore, as there is nothing about her or the Aspect of Justice that would warrant a vampiric ability. The recent Syndra changes on the PTB show Riot is willing to \"rework\" a champion in a way that they're still completely recognizable. The biggest change to Syndra was a rework of her passive, with tweaks to the rest of her kit to facilitate.\n\nI think Morgana could handle a similar rework, focusing more on her passive with tweaks to her kit that enhance her abilities. Because Morgana is so solid as-is, I can't see Riot devoting that kind of time to her right now. But maybe, when the story takes us back to Demacia and Kayle returning, Morgana might see some kind of small change to increase hype."

                "body": "While I hope there's more to come for the Wonderlands we have now (specifically more story content and the ability to repeat story missions), there are things I'd like to see in the future that just couldn't be done in a dlc update. (Maybe an expansion, though.)\n\nFirst up, when/if we get a sequel, I hope we keep all the classes we have now. In the Borderlands games we get completely new classes with every title, but that's because Borderlands classes are specific people with their own specific skill sets. But Wonderlands is modeled after D&D archetypes (and Diablo), and while there are tons of official and homebrew classes throughout editions, there are typically 10-12 \"core\" classes that we've consistently seen since at least D&D 3rd edition. Obviously I'd also want *new* classes, but I'd hope we get all the Wonderlands classes (including any unreleased dlc classes we could potentially see in the future). \n\nSecondly, I want each class to have 2 skill trees with 1 action skill tied to it. When you gain the ability to multiclass you can only choose *one* skill tree from the 2nd class you choose. This will limit your choice of Action Skills, but should be made up for in expanded build paths and skills that augment your action skills (or even BL3 style augments for Action Skills). Currently, most classes focus on 2 strategies anyway, so giving each a skill tree focused on one strategy should be easy enough. (Brr-zerker, for instance, could have a tree dedicated to Frost Damage and Rage buffs and one dedicated to Melee damage and survivability.)\n\nThird, I'd like to move away from uninteractive class feats. Imo, Spellshot, Brr-zerker, and Blightcaller have the best class feats because they're things you can manage (even though I wish Blightcaller's had a bit more to interact with in it). Stabbomancer could have something more fun than just a static increase to Crit Chance, and I think we could get by with only 1 class having a companion feat. (Probably Spore Warden, as they're the Ranger archetype and Rangers are associated with animal companions.) And even then, I'd want to see a little extra added into the passive than *just* the companion.\n\nThis doesn't mean I think we should move away from these companions completely, but I think we could tie them to gear via legendary passive or enchantment passive. Meanwhile, Graveborn could get a class feat like \"Necromantic: When you kill an enemy or apply a Dark magic status effect, there's a 10% chance you create a skeleton that chases and explodes on nearby enemies.\" Clawbringer could lean into the Paladin fantasy with some kind of Smite class feat, or protective Ward that helps friendly players and companions. Spore Warden's shroom could just get the skill that let's them revive you tied in with it's feat.\n\nFourth, I want more Borderlands cameos. I understand they didn't want to include *too* many BL tie-ins for people who may not have played a BL game, but I think we could include some more fan favorites without hassle. Maya, for instance, would be a good candidate (assuming a sequel will take place between 2-3 again), as would Scooter. (If you know you know.) Valentine and Fritte would have to stick around, of course, and maybe even get their own B&B characters this time. (I'd love to see Valentine as a Swashbuckler of some kind, and making Fritte a Spellshot would be a funny nod to her OP character in the opening scene and Spellshot being the strongest class in Wonderlands.)\n\nFinally, I hope the sequel has a fun D&D inspired name like \"Tiny Tina's Advanced Wonderlands\" (referencing 2nd edition D&D being named \"Advanced Dungeons and Dragons\") or just \"Wonderlands 2E.\" It's a small thing, sure, but a welcome one."

Lewis made it clear he was interested many times and Cleo had many opportunities to get back with him and she chose not to speak up. Then, Cleo loses her job because of her own irresponsibility. When Lewis got the job that he actually needed and had every right to get, Rikki and Emma sabotage it for him because Cleo is a whiny brat. How is that fair? I\u2019m surprised Lewis continues to try to be on good terms with them after the way they treat him."

We don\u2019t have to project it all onto our TF, our mirror soul, who chooses to stay on the other side of the looking glass.

I have my doubts\u2026. I just can\u2019t have faith when we\u2019ve already been separated for so long.  But I know that the self-healing will be a huge benefit to me, anyway.

At first I suggested that perhaps we could be friends, since I wanted to respect his decision but didn\u2019t want to lose our special connection, but he decided he couldn\u2019t handle that.  \n\nThat\u2019s when the enormity of the loss suddenly hit me - and then I threw caution and dignity out the window and begged him to choose me, instead.  He went radio silent and for two months I felt like I was dying, couldn\u2019t eat, sleep, or concentrate on work; would find myself gasping for breath at random moments\u2026 Was just totally haunted and looked like it, too, lost 20 lbs, etc.  All of the signs and syncs were happening and that\u2019s when I found out about TF theory.  \n\nAfter a few months he finally contacted me and by the sounds of it, his story about the other woman may have been false or exaggerated - he revealed some other things about his life and his past and how he couldn\u2019t handle feeling so vulnerable with me\u2026. I\u2019ve been very careful in our text correspondence not to overstep any boundaries - I don\u2019t pry into his life, etc.  But he moved across the country a year or so ago (coincidentally, just an hour from where my mother lives [also where his mother lives!])\u2026\n\nI assume he\u2019s had some relationships in the meantime.  A part of me wonders if he may actually be in something serious now, and I would just never know.  It\u2019s actually easier to assume that he\u2019s taken, and not just single and rejecting me forever, lol.

I thought maybe he figured I didn\u2019t care about him as more than a casual, distant friend - that I had gotten over him - but I needed him to know that would never happen.  He didn\u2019t respond to my email, but we still text (I usually let him initiate and sometimes it can be several weeks, but he still reaches out\u2026).\n\nI thought about telling him again every year\u2026. But\u2026 What good would it do? I already told him he would be in my heart for the rest of my life.  I think he believes me and doesn\u2019t need any reminding.  And he chooses to keep his distance.\n\nI\u2019m fine with continuing my life, but I don\u2019t think the hole he left in my heart will ever be filled or even scarred over.  I feel like I\u2019ve lost a spiritual limb, or one of my senses.  It\u2019s awful.  A part of me now wishes I\u2019d never met him - I just want to be able to find love and comfort for my future\u2026",

After numerous mishaps, the latest has been them misplacing/losing my second round of refinements for THREE MONTHS.  I got scanned early October, called them mid-December and was told they didn't have them yet - blaming Invisalign.  Mid-January I called Invisalign directly and they contacted my dentist.  Magically, they suddenly discovered my refinements had arrived at the end of October (and yet, when I called mid-December, they had that big story about going back and forth to make the ClinCheck just right, that they had expected the refinements at the end of November, but didn't have them becuz Invisalign?).\n\nAfter I rejected their apology \"from the bottom of their hearts\", they offered to compensate me for the trouble by upgrading the retainers in my treatment plan to 4 sets of Vivera retainers instead of 1 basic non-Vivera set.  The problem is, my treatment plan already says \"Invisalign retainer\" for $400 - I was under the impression that this already meant the Vivera set of 4, since it's the only one Invisalign manufactures (as stated on their website).  I asked my dentist specifically - how is \"Invisalign retainer\" different from Vivera?  She assured me that there \\*is\\* a difference in quality.  I asked her if she meant an Essix retainer, and she reiterated \"No, it's called Invisalign retainer\".\n\nI am convinced that she is being shady again, and offering to compensate me with something already listed and paid for in my treatment plan ($400 seems to be in the low end but I have seen it online as a price quote for 4 sets of Vivera).  I tried calling Invisalign directly, again, but haven't reached anyone yet.\n\nI feel like I need to get at least a partial refund from this dentist as my compensation, if not $3K to be able to afford transferring to an orthodontist I consulted after one of the previous mishaps with this dentist.  Just shady AF - I also think Invisalign should pull their association with this dental office because they're giving the company a bad rep, but it's probably easier just to try to handle me (one disgruntled patient) rather than cutting off a whole pipeline of possible customers..."

Everyone has been uneasy about spending and \"money printing\" frenzy already done by the fed, with various financial channels eyeing an accelerating 10 year note the past couple of months, but again this has been all hype and overreaction as far as equity markets are concerned.\n\n[White House closes in on $1 trillion plan centered on child care, pre-K, paid family leave - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/04/19/white-house-families-plan/)\n\nRates are now starting to stabilize and we're looking at an explosive rebound in tech and recovery that's on its way to being priced in.

The president campaigned on equalizing the capital gains and income tax rates for rich Americans. \"\n\n[What Biden's capital gains tax proposal could mean for your wallet](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-capital-gain-tax-proposal-wealthy-americans)\n\nWith an article heading like that... these guys are so mad they're tripping over their own dicks.\n\nAnd don't get my started on the crypto sell off smooth brain takes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[She's probably mad she bought at 0.399](https://preview.redd.it/cwng7fx5a3v61.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7e883350b24857fdecdac317d2d9f46082ae05d9)\n\nYou've got crypto investors talking a big game saying \"I'll just tell them I lost my BTC in a boeing accident. TAX THAT!\". Lmao smh, you really want some beef with the IRS? Here's a quick fact:\n\n\"IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig recently told Congress that the United States is losing roughly $1 trillion in unpaid taxes every year in large part because of tax evasion, particularly among the wealthy and corporations.\"\n\nJaney Yellen has already spoken on this on many of her congressional appearances and there appears to be a semblance of byparticanship when it comes to havint the wealthy stop hoarding their wealth in Bermuda or Ireland or WHEVER the FK that isn't where that wealth was produced. This is mere dick wagging at a frat party that's already pissed in the punch bowl and now they're wanting to cash out. The same story will fall upon crypto so BE READY.\n\nWhen there is panic in the street, you as a small time investor should look for opportunity. Just like GME taught us that there is no shortage of shorts to go around, there won't be any lack of FUD for the incoming taxpocalypse and that means lot of dips once these policies begin to more forward. Look for the suits to keep spewing over long term prospects industries like clean, EV and disruptive tech like Crypto and DeFi. More than likely they will make any excuses for why certain assets will only baghold. BTC is one of these cases. Some others include: Coinbase, Tesla and Roblox.\n\nBut IMO: STAY AWAY FROM HYPED SPACs and DOGE (Unless ELON can sell you ticket to Mars with it).\n\nThese are bound to get regulated out the ass, specially for those that can't report legit numbers to the SEC and crypto that's not set up for transactions and taxes.\n\n[Daseke Comments on Recent SEC Statement Relating to Warrants and Announces Timing for First Quarter Earnings Call (streetinsider.com)](https://www.streetinsider.com/Globe+Newswire/Daseke+Comments+on+Recent+SEC+Statement+Relating+to+Warrants+and+Announces+Timing+for+First+Quarter+Earnings+Call/18298790.html)\n\nI don't have a reasonable take on the rest of crypto that isn't BTC, but I recommend this channel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zaeu0m9PP1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zaeu0m9PP1s)\n\nAt the end of the day...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DO NOT FEAR](https://preview.redd.it/hhpqfj88a3v61.png?width=595&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f41bc53c1b1847266e9064106b514ac02053a40d)\n\nTLDR: HOW will we Invest if Taxpocalypse occurs?\n\nEASY. Diamond hand the companies that you believe will grow on the long term. The simple Warren Buffet Rule: \"buy the f\\*king dip\""
