I don\u2019t think it really provided any substance and was more of a shock value thing \u2014 I do love the first movie as well, I just think that the ending is a bit\u2026dated.\n\nANOES will always be my favorite Horror series (maybe tied with Scream because I love a good satire) \u2014 if I had to recommend watch order for ANOES it would be 1>3>4 (if you like series so far)>5 (if you liked 4)>6 (if you don\u2019t mind the movie being kinda dumb by comparison)>2 (if you hate yourself \u2014 just kidding, kind of*)>FvJ (campy fun and takes itself way less seriously, which is kind of hard to do since ANOES is very campy to begin with)>2010 remake (almost no camp so if that\u2019s your thing maybe skip this one \u2014 a LOT of the fanbase hates it and I can kind of see where they\u2019re coming from but I LOVED Rooney Mara and Kyle Gallner\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t bad either. And having a darker Freddy was really cool IMO) \n\n*2 is kind of weird because it\u2019s just an outlier in so many ways. The theme is more about >!homosexuality and \u2018coming to terms\u2019? with it (in a time period when the AIDS panic was rampant and most commonly associated with gay men)!< and the main character was kinda flimsy IMO, the girlfriend was insufferable (not to mention it has the shortest screentime for Freddy of any of the movies) \u2014 but if you\u2019re looking for a movie that\u2019s more interested in exploring sexuality and isn\u2019t focused so heavily on the antagonist, definitely try giving 2 a watch. It wasn\u2019t really my thing, personally, but there are some pretty great cinematic moments in it.",

                "body": "Hey, this happened to me three times already. Basically, after sleep in a state where I'm not that tired I suddenly feel that my body gets numb extremely fast and I don't feel gravity anymore so I shift around a bit and \"stand up\" while I'm physically still lying down. Suddenly it's like I get pulled into another dimension and I'm in a very dark place. I can't feel my body anymore and see a green, later white face, staring at me. Fight reaction kicks in and this is when I can feel my body a bit, but I can't move. I had to open my eyes forcefully to end this state. Interesting thing, is that even before my body got numb I was hearing really loud whispering and laughter which continued throughout the whole experience. After my body got numb a really deep tinnitus set in which lasted for some time after I 'woke up'.\n\nToday my boyfriend also experienced this which left me curious. He told me he saw a house and a face too, but didn't have any auditory hallucinations. It does sound like an OBE but I'm not spiritual and want to keep my options for explanations open. I'm really confused about this. We both have consumed weed before and I personally have abused DPH in addition to that. It seems a bit extreme for a sleep paralysis since my whole sense of self was disconnected from my body.\n\nAny ideas?"

People around rushed to help me up as the man hurled abuses at me. Pedestrians sided with me. There's minimal damage but....... I'd just gotten her wrapped, fixed up and everything cuz an earlier incident (not an accident) kept me from riding for a month. I was so HAPPY after being miserable for a month, I love to ride and work on my bike. But it's just... the expenses have been heavy the past month, I don't think I can afford to put in the money and effort rn and It feels like shit. \n\nAnyone got stories? How often do you crash/damage your ride? How do you deal with it??"

They are an important part of Indian economy and everyday lifestyle. But this particular vendor needs to go. He (and his wife) sell sugarcane juice outside, near my society.\n\nI had never interacted with him until a couple weeks ago, when my friend insisted that we buy some saying they're good and healthier than most soft drinks. I gave in and admittedly the drinks weren't bad. But when I paid the guy, Paytm and other UPI apps were on the fritz I guess, so I paid him \u20b990 x3. That's \u20b9180 more than needed. When I became aware I went back and showed him the transactions asking for the money back, but that day his phone was \"low on battery\" and he couldn't confirm the transactions on his end. So he said we'll do it tomorrow. \n\nHe didn't show up for 2 days after. And I had an accident afterwards so, jump a week later and I get to the guy. We check the transactions and turns out there are none. ITS ALL GONE. When I ask, the cheeky fuck says he erases all transactions daily (wtf???) So now he says he'll go to the bank to confirm, tomorrow. Now again more than a week later cuz (i got busy) I go to him today. And the guy says he was too busy didn't go to the bank and is basically refusing to return the money cuz HE can't confirm it. I SHOWED HIM THE TRANSACTIONS ON MY BANKING APP AND PAYTM. HIS NAME IS ON THERE. \nThis is when I finally lose it and end up in a verbal spat. The guy returns the money but acts like he's doing me a favour. Him and his wife going about how \"chote log nahi hain ham, 5 manzil ka flat hai hamara idhar\". I don't like sanctimonious pricks and certainly not uncalled for bs. I'm well off but not well off enough to be going around throwing money. \n\nSo, YES it's about my ego. But he isn't a great guy either. And I want em gone. Any one got a clue?\n\nP.S. \n\ntl;Dr the vendor was a sanctimonious selfish prick, I want him gone."

Red -State America didn't horde its technology,  they shared their inventions and life-preserving discoveries with the world, so that children in West Africa don't shit themselves to death of cholera. Willis Carrier's air conditioning has made life tolerable in places that were intolerable, where antimalarials and humanitarian food drops, and the eradication of the guinea worm parasite and every other problem gets better time, attention, and charity. no nation gives as freely or as widely to anyone.",

BUT if we can inject (HONEST, HEALTHY, KIND) interest into our lives, we can push through the crap a little easier.(I'm going to post now because I can feel that Interest gauge at 80% and dropping. God willing, I'll Explain the \"how to\" after a SHORT break)\n\nOK! So how to keep the Interest gauge up? basically, do more engaging, interesting stuff. stuff that would make neurotypicals feel stressed. like full contact sparring or HIIT. or Intense debate (WITH A SIMILARLY- GEARED INDIVIDUAL. repeat after me \"neurotypicals are friends, not food, not foes\"). or active problem-solving. or spontaneous dance.  \n\n\nTry to keep that interest tank full. in this analogy, we need \"interest pressure\" at about 80% to a neurotypical's like 40%."

Put my big dick energy alpha heels on, preordered my Starbucks so I don\u2019t have to talk to anyone on my way to work because I\u2019m just waaaayy too busy trying to rule the world to pretend to care about baristas. You know, just another morning being the rarest female MBTI type (shut up it\u2019s not INTJ it\u2019s ENTJ). Yes I\u2019m special. Got to work, pitched my latest and greatest AMAZING idea on how to make the company millions of more dollars because I\u2019m a down-to-earth genius. Won over the simps *I mean coworkers* with my charm and dashing looks... again. Checked up on my side hustle- stock investments - and freelanced consulted a new business on how to be great like me. Got a text message from my ex-boyfriend telling me that he still loves me but I left him on read. Feelings? What are those. I don\u2019t believe in love. I believe in cold, hard cash and conquering the world. \n\nSpeaking of which I\u2019m expecting money deposited in my account tomorrow from my 17 side hustles. \n\nAnother day won. \n\nSuch a hard life being the best."

But in short, I accidentally had unprotected sex with a partner while I was menstruating and it was either a new or full moon, it was like one of those big, crystal clear and super orange-red moons. \n\nBut in essence I think I may have accidentally binded him to me, that was 3 years ago. Since then we\u2019ve been caught up in a cycle that consistently breaks me down and we\u2019re both drawn to each other after all is said and done. But I want to let go and move, but I can\u2019t seem to.\n\nIt\u2019s like every time I\u2019ve made up my mind to move on, something catapults us together. And when I think we\u2019re gonna make it, something rips us apart. Maybe these are tower moments but I don\u2019t know. This feels unnatural.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve had menstrual sex (only because I didn\u2019t know it had power) and those men that I actually wanted to be with have always came back in some form or another, but I moved on from them so I never really noticed it, but this time is different.\n\nAnyways sorry for the long post\n\n\nTL;DR: can i reverse accidental bloodbinding/sex magick? Was it even magick or am I just being cuckoo?"

Flooding is also common in some cities.\n* Like it's the case for any developing country, I think, things are a bit messy and violent here. You'll have to be resilient and crafty to lead a good life, be OK with uncertainty and cutting corners, that kind of thing.\n* Brazil is divided into five regions. Begin deciding where you want to go by region before the city. I think most people would prefer living in the south, but I like the northeast myself, as high as the homicide rate there is...\n* Whenever you run into a problem from bureaucracy to loud neighbors and trafficking next to your house, you'll likely have to endure it or solve it yourself, adding to the crafty, resilient, and social points I've made before.\n* People are generally welcoming and more than happy to interact with foreigners, so don't be afraid of asking for help.\n\nHealthcare is great here, but as a Canadian me saying that probably doesn't impress you!",

Les distinctions sociales ne peuvent \u00eatre fond\u00e9es que sur l'utilit\u00e9 commune\". Donc on peut faire des distinctions sociales, et \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 valid\u00e9 par le Conseil Constitutionnel, et donc le l\u00e9gislateur passe son temps \u00e0 distinguer les administr\u00e9s en diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories avec diff\u00e9rent droits positifs (la DDHC se limitant \u00e0 garantir l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 de droits n\u00e9gatifs vagues, genre libert\u00e9 d'expression.

Donc si le maintien de la natalit\u00e9 et le financement des retraites fonde bien  l'utilit\u00e9 commune, alors on peut distinguer les parents des non parents.

Basically, I am a French 19M Erasmus student studying in Ireland, and a friend invited me tonight, so I wanted to buy some beers to bring. \n   I went to Tesco, chose 4 craft beers, some pringles and some pepsi, then went to a cashier line (because I was not sure if automatic cashier accepted alcohol). I prepared my French ID card and gave it to the cashier. She looked at it for half a second and told me she was not able to sell me alcohol because the shop policy is that you need your passport or an Irish/British driving licence. Obviously, I dont have both, because my passport expires in 2 months so I didn't bring it, as an European it's not a problem at all, I only need my ID. And of course my driving licence is French.\n   I was a bit confused because it never comes to my mind that I could be denied to buy alcohol, I look way older than I am (big beard), and in France I had to show my ID no more than 3 times in 2 years of buying alcohol. So I don't really understand the Tesco policy, like why do I need my passport if I got my ID ? If anyone working there could explain me why, I will be grateful because now I am a bit astonished.\n\n   And more broadly, it makes me wonder about the issue that Irish society seems to have with alcohol. I am not an expert at all in Irish culture but it's a bit weird because it's very well known for its pub and its alcohol (beer, whiskey), and Irish people seems very nice and loving to party. But on the other hand, alcohol consumption is a lot repressed and looks like bad thing in public, and from my French education and point of view I really do not understand it (I mean, I remember easily going into some bar whereas I was only 15 in France and some friends buying beers at a supermarket, without ever feeling like doing a very bad thing, and I do'nt know anybody who ever abuse with alcohol, so, such repression seems pointless in France). So if you have academic or press articles about alcohol in Ireland, policy around it and the law, that could explain to me why it is so reprehensive to buy a single beer or drink it in the street (75 euros fine damn) in Ireland, share it, I would be very glad to understand a bit more of Irish culture !\n\nEdit : I should note that 1 month ago I managed to buy a bottle of wine with my ID card, so I wasn't expecting to be denied at all\n\nEdit 2 : After a bit of talking, I think I was going way too far in my reflexion, and yeah that's basically only because big shops dont want to be forced to close and that ID cards are not standardised"

Anything I accomplish or achieve she does either before me or better than me. For example, I graduated 3rd in my class, she graduated valedictorian. I got a really good scholarship to my university, she went to the same university and got a full ride. I majored in fine arts (which nobody cares about), she majored in a STEM field (which everyone is in awe over). If I do anything special or worth praising, she has either already done it so it's not impressive anymore by the time I do and it kind of looks like I'm just copying her, or she does it right after I do and she does it better so everyone forgets about my achievement and dumps all their praise on her. And she is aware of this too and definitely thinks she's better than me. My entire life has been characterized by this, I have felt overlooked and undervalued my whole life because everyone cares more about my sister than me. \n\nMy sister is getting married soon and she is the first in our family to get married. I have been having a hard time with it because I know that this is just like everything else: she is the first one to do it so it is the most special one. Our parents are going all out and I can't help but feel like they won't care as much when it's my turn because it'll be \"old news\" by then. She is getting all this money and fanfare surrounding it and my mom is giving her this heirloom wedding piece that I thought was supposed to go to me as the oldest, since the tradition in our family was for it to be passed down from the mother to the oldest daughter. But my mom is giving it to her. \n\nNot to mention everyone has been acting like they pity me (if they aren't outright ignoring me) when it comes to my sister's wedding and I am so sick of it. \n\nAlso everything I try to do or want to do that in the back of my mind I hope will set me apart and make my family talk about me with pride separate from my sister, she then decides she is going to do. I did theatre in high school so she joined it. I want to get my masters degree, she wants to get her masters degree (and I just know that no matter how it happens they will all care more about when she does it: if I get mine first, they will just move on and forget about me when she gets hers, and if she gets hers first, they will consider it old news and boring when I get mine. I am always the afterthought). \n\nWe just had her bridal shower and she got all these nice kitchen things which is fine except that she is a lousy cook and literally never cooks anyway. Meanwhile I am known for being the cook of the family but no one has ever thought to get me anything nice to cook with. Also I found out there that she apparently wants to keep bees now, which everyone in my family knows is something I have wanted to do for a long time. I know it seems silly but they were all gung ho and supportive of her getting bees but all the times in the past I've mentioned that it was something I wanted to do they just mocked me and brought up the fact that I used to be scared of bees when I was like 5. I literally can't win with them, there is nothing I can do or say or achieve that will make me stand out from my sister and nothing I can do that will make them as proud and supportive of me as they are of her. She is stealing everything in my life that sets me apart and getting all the love that I feel like I should be getting as a result and I feel so depressed because I am fully aware that this has been this way since we were children. I have always been compared to her and never measured up. My interests were always shelved or ignored if hers were going on. My accomplishments have always been overshadowed by her accomplishments. I know that if I bring up how I'm feeling to my parents they will just dismiss my feelings and say that I am being a bad sister/person and that they don't love her more than me but it's not true. I'm tired of always standing by and supporting my sister who everyone loves more than me, knowing that it will never ever flip in my favor. \n\ntl;dr my sister is stealing everything that sets me apart and my family loves her more than me"

                "body": "I (24f) have a sister (23f) who I always had a close relationship with growing up. We would fight as children of course but I felt like as we got into our teens, and especially going to the same college, we smoothed out a lot of those childhood issues. Apparently I was wrong. \n\nMy sister, who I'll call H, has always been the \"golden child\" of our family, and from the way my parents have always talked about her, you would think that she could do no wrong. \"H is so smart\" \"H is so kind\" \"H is so good at music\" \"H is so mature\" My sister never got in trouble while my brother and I got in trouble all time, even though she was responsible for inciting a lot of our fights or spats. She was sneaky and good at reading people, so she would always do or say something that she knew would make me or my brother mad and then we would get in trouble for how we reacted when she was the one who caused it in the first place. But I digress.\n\nMy sister and I always had different strengths, but we were both very academically inclined and high achieving students. She was good at math and science but sucked at literature or anything creative. I was always good at humanities and fine arts but I sucked at math and science. I have never felt the need to compete with her in that arena because I simply didn't care about those subjects outside of wanting to do well in school. However, I did want to be acknowledged for the things I was good at, which never happened because let's face it people don't care about the arts as much as they do STEM. My sister excelled in areas that people care about/find impressive, so she always got heaps of praise. I excelled in areas that people think are a waste of time, so I got zero praise. And since she is only a year younger than me, much of this was simultaneous. \n\nNot only have people never cared about my achievements as much as they cared about hers, but she has always upstaged all of my achievements as well. I have never been able to have the spotlight only on myself because any time I achieved something, she either did the same thing but better, or she just joined whatever I did and then I still didn't have the spotlight. I ranked 3rd in my graduating class, she got valedictorian. I got the lead in several school plays, she joined theatre and got cast out of the blue. I got a prestigious scholarship to my university, she went to the same university and got an even better scholarship. I was asked by a professor to submit some research to an undergrad research conference, she submits her research the same year and hers gets accepted while mine is rejected. I graduate summa cum laude, she graduates summa cum laude *and* university scholar.\n\n I know how selfish all of this sounds and I don't think she was doing all the same things as me just to steal my spotlight but my whole life I've just wanted to be seen as valued and for the people who's opinions I care about to think that I am an impressive person and that I am exceptional in some way. I know I do well in the areas I do well in, but no matter what I do, it will always be overshadowed by what H does. Now that we're adults out of college, it's started to happen where she is achieving things or reaching life milestones before I do. She is getting married soon, and she will be the first child of my parents to get married, as well as the first grandchild on both sides of the family to get married. So it's a huge deal. I'm her maid of honor and I am happy for her but I can't help but feel a little insecure that it wasn't me getting married first. I just know that at her wedding people are going to be looking at me, her older sister, with pity because I'm still single. And by the time I do get married it I feel like it won't be a big deal to anyone anymore, like \"Oh congrats on your engagement bethel\\_bop, but H did it first so it's old news now.\" She and I have both been wanting to get our masters degrees. She started applying to grad schools as soon as she finished her undergrad, while I have been teaching and traveling and trying to save money. She has finally gotten an invitation to interview for a masters program, and again I'm happy for her, but it is tinged with more insecurity because I know that if she gets accepted into this program she will be the first person in our family to get a master's degree, and again, even if I eventually get mine, no one will be as proud of me as they were of her. No one remembers the name of the second man on the moon, you know? \n\nTo top it all off, all the constant praise and adulation that has colored my sister's entire life has absolutely gone to her head. She thinks she is better than almost everyone, but especially her siblings. My brother, who is only slightly less overlooked than I am because he is the only boy in the family, and I have been on the receiving end of this for years, and it only got worse when she got her first boyfriend (now fianc\u00e9). She invites him over to our shared apartment all the time without asking if we are okay with it (we often aren't) and they lay sprawled out on the couch groping each other while we try to have a pleasant evening. She likes to rub it in our faces that she is in a relationship and we are not. She leaves household chores undone because she is \"too busy wedding planning,\" so my brother and I have taken on 100% of the chores while she does nothing. She does little inconsiderate things to both of us (eg. she never changes the toilet paper so I always have to do it, she leaves doors open that we have repeatedly said we need shut, she leaves candles burning overnight and lights on because she was \"too tired\" from wedding planning to turn them off before going to bed, etc. *ad nauseam*). I was in a different country for an entire year so I really noticed it when I came back, how snooty and self-important and just simply mean she had gotten. She has no problem letting me and my brother know exactly in what ways we are deficient as people (and she'll do it with a sneer or a stifled laugh that lets us know exactly where we stand in her mind) but the second either one of us tries to bring up something she does that bothers us or that we wish she would stop doing, it's immediately followed by accusations that we just think she's stupid, defensive outbursts and attempts to turn the issue back onto us and make it out that we are actually the ones to blame, or dismissive and insincere \"apologies\" so that we'll just shut up about it. And after two decades of never being held accountable for her actions and being led to believe that she is never in the wrong, can you blame her? I would never accept blame either if I had been told my whole life that I was faultless in every single incident. \n\nBefore anyone comes at me with accusations that I'm jealous of my sister, yeah. I am. I envy the years of adoration and attention that she had growing up, I wish that people had given me as much glowing praise for my accomplishments as they gave her for hers. I wish that people spoke to me with as much interest in my fine arts major as they did in her STEM major. I wish that people admired my warm feelings as much as they do her cool logic. I wish that my own successes had been able to stand alone and that I didn't have to share the spotlight with my apparently more impressive sister every single time I achieved anything. I wish that my parents had let me have some activities that were just for me so that I was able to feel special and not like I was competing for their praise with someone who already had a head start in that department. I wish that I had older cousins on one side of the  family so that they could get married first or get advanced degrees so that it would sting a little less that she's the first person in our immediate family to do these things, because then at least she wouldn't be the first person in the *entire* family. I wish that I had family members who were at least more subtle about their preference for certain children or grandchildren, because believe me, when a child isn't the favorite they know it. I'm not jealous of my sister's successes. I don't care about science and I think her relationship with her fianc\u00e9 is awkward and rushed. I don't want the things she has achieved. I'm jealous of her because I know that more than 20 years have passed and I will never be able to go back in time and be the one everyone praised, she was. I'm jealous because she can be a mean, nasty person, but she's detached and savvy enough to put up a sweet, demure veneer so that no one knows, whereas I am so completely emotionally honest that all my anger and frustrations manage to bubble up to the surface despite my best attempts to squash them down, and then I get reprimanded while she gets off scot free knowing she can do or say whatever she wants and get away with it. I'm jealous because I know that no matter what I do, no matter how impressive I am or how many awards or accolades I win, she will always do it either first or better and no one will care about it when I do it. \n\nI know there are worse things in the world than to be a high achieving, privileged person who is just upset that she will never get the attention from her parents that she wants, and I actually have worse things going on in my life. But this is just on my mind because of certain things that she has been doing this week. I know envy is an ugly ugly thing, and I hate myself for it. I want to be completely present for all the good things happening in her life, but this tiny voice in the back of my mind keeps reminding me that no one would make such a fuss if it were me doing those things instead of her, and no one is going to care anymore when I actually do them.\n\ntl;dr: younger sister has always been the golden child, I was always overlooked, and it's affected the way both of us have turned out as adults :(("

Approaching the numinous is really the only thing that lets me experience everything. It is so great sometimes for me.. quitting the weed was one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done.",

                "body": "I\u2019ll start by speaking a little about myself. I\u2019m 24 years old turning 25 in December. \n\nIn July 2012 when I was 15, I was kicked out of high school for continuously being caught with weed and fighting and overall being stupid. It all started with this girl tormenting me in 2011; setting me up to get robbed. Snitching on me when I had weed and me acting tough to defend myself and then getting egged on by others to fight them. \n\nBy august 2012; my father chased me up the stairs with a butter knife after I threatened that I would tell my mom he was driving drunk with me again. The cops were called. I didn\u2019t see him again for 7 years when I got locked up in a mental institution. \n\nTo fast forward today; I\u2019ll be sober a year in may 20th. I\u2019ve applied for university again after being told to leave 7 years ago after binge drinking consecutively.\n\nI\u2019ve began to really contemplate and pay attention to how my addictive behaviour formed and how it\u2019s progressed in cunning ways. I remember how disconnected I was with myself at a young age. I remember the first time I stole something when I was 7 and how much power I felt like almost mania. I remember how I had this ability to command my perspective at will. I would set my parents up against each other. I would torment some kids at school. Everyone saw me as very kind and there was a part of me that was but there was another part that could truly destroy life without mercy. \n\nI always had a lot of empathy for my father for some strange reason. As a kid; my mother was very strict. She wouldn\u2019t let me play Pok\u00e9mon because she thought it was violent but a couple weeks later she bought me call of duty because my cousin played it. My father would watch two and a half men with me as a kid when my mom and sister were sleeping. \n\nMy sister is working on her PHD and just looks at me like I\u2019m worthless. I sometimes enter a state where it\u2019s like none of my past happened and it\u2019s like my mom wants me to do that because it\u2019s the only way she survives. \n\nI am so angry with her. I feel so trapped. It is so hard for me to keep a job. I cannot tolerate people. I am so vulnerable to taking on their psyches. \n\nMy mother would randomly put me down and then deny that she ever did it. She would lie and say \u201cit\u2019s just what people say\u201d. She told me my father was abusive and I just don\u2019t know what is true. \n\nI don\u2019t have any friends because I have a lack of complacency to remain within one state long enough for anyone to know me truly. \n\nThe concepts of Jung and approaching the numinous is my leading motivation and pursuit for living a life suitable for society and any sort of humane way of existence. I cry out of gratefulness. It lets me feel like I\u2019m a human and practice empathy towards my mother and this way of passive aggressive behaviour. I know it\u2019s all rooted from her lack of healing but sometimes it is incredibly challenging to be around. \n\nFor most of my life I had no motivation and was shunned for it by her. \n\nWhen I talk about psychology; She makes a circle and so passionately split s it up into pie shapes and explain to me how everyone fragments. everyone has borderline personality with this sort of false humility and arrogance then a couple weeks later come home exhausted saying that she had a patient that was just \u201cso borderline\u201d. \n\nSometimes I really see the good in her but I quickly turn overweight and a mommas boy suddenly being called lazy if I do for too long. Her criticisms haunt my thoughts. \n\nShe is so calm in front of everyone else. She is a well establish psychiatrist but suddenly acts like an uneducated dumb blonde at a party or some sort of way like a stripper without the direct sexual provocative notion. \n\nI feel so powerless. My head feels so much tension sometimes. \n\nI often become familiar with concepts of destruction and deceit to survive.  I really don\u2019t know what to do besides study.."

Like you I wasn\u2019t happy with how I was treated but I found the Swiss system to be much higher quality.\n\nI looked online for a gastroenterologist, booked an appointment, took my medical file with me then he discussed my situation and I\u2019ve been in treatment there since. \n\nAll the prescriptions are going through the general insurance, no need for supplementary, in any case you\u2019d get rejected automatically, like me, can\u2019t get a supplementary anywhere because of IBD.\n\nFor second opinions, no worries, if you have an insurance scheme with no restrictions (meaning \u00ab\u00a0choose your doctor\u00a0\u00bb type), you can just go anywhere you\u2019d like and they will pay for it. \n\nIt\u2019s a bit more expensive than taking a restrictive scheme but with an IBD having the liberty to choose the doctor, and decide when you need to go without having to get it approved is absolutely a must.\n\nFeel free to PM would be happy to help!",

I played around and come up with some location mechanism. I have the following scenario: \n\nThere are certain locations, where a player can go. Each location has a label and immediately calls a screen, example:\n\n    label HouseHallwayFromOffice:\n        scene expression \"locations/house/hallway/from_office/screen_\" + timeOfDay + \".png\" with Dissolve(0.5)\n        call screen HouseHallwayFromOffice\n\nAnd I have a following screen:\n\n    screen HouseHallwayFromOffice():\n        add \"locations/house/hallway/from_office/screen_\" + timeOfDay + \".png\"\n        modal True\n    \n        imagebutton auto \"locations/house/hallway/from_office/back_\" + timeOfDay + \"_%s.png\":\n            focus_mask True\n            action Jump(\"HouseOfficeDoor\")\n    \n        imagebutton auto \"locations/house/hallway/from_office/exit_\" + timeOfDay + \"_%s.png\":\n            focus_mask True\n            action Jump(\"HouseHallwayFromOfficeExit\")\n    \n    ....... etc\n\nIt does work like that: A player can click on different things on the screen to get some main character thoughts, and it goes back to the screen, example when clicking on a door exit:\n\n    label HouseHallwayFromOfficeExit:\n        \"I think it's a little bit too late to leave outside.\"\n        \"I'd get robbed.\"\n        \"It's not like I have anything of value anyway.\"\n        call screen HouseHallwayFromOffice with Dissolve(0.5)\n\nHowever I noticed that it's a really tedious process to do this for every location, register all imagebuttons a player can click, and having tons of labels that do the same thing.

Problem is, the knowledge about the game seems to be pretty sparse compared to games I used to play in the past. So I'll just post my questions here. Sorry if they are silly or something.\n\n1. When you start the game, you are all alone in your ship. But every time you buy a ship you need to assign a pilot. Then you can ask him to let you control the ship and he's your secondary pilot. Question is, can you fully regain control of the ship, so when you stand up, this second pilot won't automatically sit down in your place? Or maybe it is a desired behavior. Or maybe it doesn't matter?\n2. I wanted to create my very first business and I bought a ship and told my pilot to mine. He didn't even fill the whole cargo bay and he was obliterated by a random Khaak in the system. Did I do something wrong? Do these mining workers need protection 24/7? If I make an order for him to mine in the area, what will happen if he fills the cargo? Will he automatically dock in the station and sell or do I need to tell him that specifically? How does it work?\n3. I wanted to play around with trade. So there's his trade filter in map menu. So far I was able to find a good that is sold and bought a bit higher on a different station. However I needed to do that manually by clicking all over the place. It seems really trouble some and counterintuitive. Is there a better way to see good trade routes where you actually earn money?\n4. What is the deal with lockboxes? I got a mission to open one. Then I approached it, shoot it and it exploded, destroying my ship. Any comment on that?\n5. On scan mode when I look through the station and I finally find the signal, sometimes I get a so called commission. What is it and what is the purpose of that?\n6. What's the deal with pilots's abilities. I see that pilots that control the ships I about has these stars as abilities. Are these important? If so, how can I develop these abilities of my people? \n\n\nBonus questions, less important than above:\n- Are there any secrets or easter eggs about the game?\n- Is exploration a viable activity? If so, what kind of exploration I can expect from the game?\n\nThank you in advance for your answers. It's difficult to find viable information about the game on the internet."

I've watched some videos on Youtube and just on paper the game seems surprisingly overwhelming. However I gave it a go. I didn't know what to do at first, after doing the tutorials but I managed to find the quest with this Boron who makes a scientific experiment. A small sense of direction for the beginning.\n\nHowever, My PC is really bad and I was having a bad time with the game. So after doing a bit of the quest I left and decided to use GeForce Now to play the game. I couldn't obviously transfer the saves, so I've started from a scratch.\n\nThe game looks and works so much better. I have to say, the difference between low settings and ultra is powerful. My second playthrough was a disaster. I don't know if I was just unlucky, but the moment you find this anomaly, the Boron is talking about and go through it, when I did, I was attacked by one of these ships that has a single letter as name. \"N\" or something, I'm not sure. Bastard was tough like a tank, so I had to run, but I couldn't. I was deleted like a fly and I was drifting around in my space suit, while my Boron friend was talking about what I was supposed to do. While I was dying there alone. I couldn't really do anything, so I had to start once again.\n\nMy third time. This time no surprising attacks, but it's just the beginning. I hope I will not get eaten by anything in the meantime. \n\nThe game seems quite fun so far, even if I haven't even scratch the surface. I hope I'll enjoy the experience. When I was a kid I used to play Freelancer a lot and the game has some similar vibes. Recently I've also finished the whole The Expanse series, and these ring gates that are all over the place are kind of similar heh. Wish X4 will scratch that itch that I have for space sims."

What is the difference between a normal map and a bump map?\n2. Everyone is saying that the perfect topology should be quads, why no one starts modelling with quads then? Wouldn't it be easier than to fix it later?\n3. Is there a gotcha when exporting a 3D model to a game engine or it's just click and done?\n4. Is it better to use image textures or procedural ones? Why?\n5. Is it better to create animation as a set of jpgs or just an mp4 file?\n6. When people create low poly models instead of giving them materials with colors, they import a color palette, then they use the uv map to set a color for all faces. Why?\n7. How many polygons is \"too much\"? When I created some highly detailed metallic object and applied all the modifiers, I got a mesh with over a million of triangles. However, I have a feeling that my object is kind of blocky, when I don't subdivide it enough. How people make objects shiny, smooth and photorealistic while keeping the polygon count low?\n8. A lot of people make humans in two ways - either model them with geometrical shapes or sculpt them. Are both of these methods valid? Is there an advantage with one over the other?\n\nThank you for your answer."

But just to give a little more description, there is a girl (19) at my university who is showing quite an interest in me (18). \n\nWe had an open talk about it before, and she seems to be ready for the relationship and is just waiting for me. Now the problem is that I had been pretty depressed, have quite a low self-esteem and overall hate myself in most cases. And she doesn't know any of this (I try to fake it to make myself look like a balanced happy person). I had been working on all these issues but as per my progress, it seems like it would take a lot of time for me.\n\nMoreover, because of all these underlying issues, I do get pretty anxious around her, put her on a pedestal and feel like I don't have any worth. Moreover, most of her close friends are the complete opposite of what I am - confident, smart, and have a great sense of humour, in short, the popular guys of Uni. When hanging out with them, it makes me hate myself and feel worthless even more.\n\nSo will it be a good step to involve in a relationship with all these problems? Would having a partner help me in my progress or would it even make it worse for her? \n\nIf the latter, how should I go with explaining it to her so that she doesn't take it as a rejection but just my attempt to keep her away from all this mess?"

Mostly because I would rather take a lot more classes that are interesting to me, and it gives me the option to do so. I will say that some classes can feel faster paced because it is a shorter amount of time, but I think many classes are realistic with the workload and generally people are happy with the quarter system here, at least among my friends. It\u2019s also great if you end up in a class you don\u2019t like but need to take because It doesn\u2019t drag on as long. \n\nFor the competitive nature part I would definitely say it applies. Obviously less so for non capacity strained majors, but many of my friends on the pre-med or bio track complain about it because people can be reallyyy annoying about it in groups sometimes. This doesn\u2019t apply to everyone of course but I\u2019ve witnessed people trying to one up each other in conversations related to major so it\u2019s definitely an underlying thing. I also know one or two people who plan on transferring as a result of the competitive nature because they don\u2019t want to compete with people are dedicating every hour of their time to make it in. I wouldn\u2019t let this fully deter you however because generally people get by okay, but it\u2019s definitely something to consider in your decision as well. Hope this helped!",

It took me two weeks to watch all of the musicals, then I devoted most of my free time during the next few months to starkid. I watched (and rewatched) tons of livestreams, different videos on their channel, fan compilations/rankings, tcb stuff, choose our destiny, other projects the actors were involved in, recordings from live shows, etc... I probably did some starkid quizzes on sporcle more than 30 times until I got it all correct.\n\nIn May I bought the digital version of Homecoming and I loved it so much, but at the same time I was very aware of how for the people in the audience these songs represented 10 years of life. Meanwhile for me it was just a culmination of past few months, because I've missed my chance to experience it all in real time. \n\nI'm still happy I could see it all though. I'm grateful they upload everything on youtube, so I had enough content for my months-long obsession. I recently went through their channel and there was nothing left I haven't seen. I just need to get used to that feeling and enjoy every new activity. It's not like there is nothing happening, just not as much as when I started",

So i suggest, dont waste your dust on leveling all cards but focus your card upgrades on all burst cards except Fragmentize, Whip of Lightning, again upgrade all support cards except Rancid Gas, Prismatic Rift and upgrade only Acid Drench in affliction section. When you have 6 maybe 7level of these cards then you need prismatic rift (no need to rancid gas again), grim shadow and fragmentize to be able to damage armor. This will max out your damage for raids. And after then, yes its good to upgrade all cards for a push bonus with that artifact(its Evergrowing Stack). And Charged Card is another card level based relic which gives gold bonus.\n\nWhy?\\* coz you can do CSB,AF,MB (chest) | SB,IF,CI (head) | PC,RW,GV(limb) | SF,PB,AD (chest) - Decks with those cards. And you can edit CSB deck with any other burst for another type of focus, PB deck with another focus support card and do VM with residue burst cards.",

I have played lots of different games to this day and in none of them there was an event which was pay to win. In an event you give effort and time to win, not cash, insomuch that premium content becomes accessible at the event time.\n\nThis is really absurd IMO.\n\n[Here,](https://i.redd.it/jj7svw8xofu31.png) how much money you need to pay inorder to complete 5500 souls for the event after you get all free to get souls (thx to [akukoutaku](https://www.reddit.com/user/akukoutaku/)). Another problem is that, it has 2 week time limit. I get my salary once per month... do i need to have money all the time?\\* Wrong move gamehive, you are losing me. I suggest **more time** on that event or at least be more greedy and make the avatar or items purchasable after the event.\n\nEdit: I have just read old posts and I accept that mine is a bit redundant but this is how you protest. And I'm sorry for saying such a bad idea which is requesting pre-event purchase option, damn its so easy to fix these things, Im not going to give anything. Events must be for the players, paying options must be for the lazy players. You are the customer and player, ask for what you deserve. If the game is for us, then you must tell them what you want. If they look from financial perspective still they have to listen customer requests. Either way this is a scam or extremly bad designed event. It doesnot matter if you have Billion dollars, it will always be stupid to pay for unnecessary things. Last DotA(Highly competitive, %100 F2P game, only cosmetic purchases, no gameplay changing things) tournament had a $34,330,068 total prize pool and that $34M is collected from %25 of player purchases. An event like a tournament must be like this. Its the proper example. Its not about being rich or poor.\n\nI LOVE PLAYING TAP TITANS. I want more poeple to play tt2."

At first, only one other morning supervisor knew about this since I needed him to assist in the transition. I also told 2 other morning shift guards to give them the opportunity to bid for my supervisor position. We had good talks and a few laughs here and there joking about the shit we all went through at the site. As two weeks go by and I coordinate with the recruiting process, word started to go around the site that I was leaving after one of the afternoon guards eavesdropped on my phone call with the client. It went from the afternoon guards, to the night shift supervisors, then to the night and swing shift guards. At this point, I thought the others would wish me luck and give me a warm send-off just like the morning guards.....but no.\n\nOne of the night supervisors got angry with me because now he has no one who can relieve him early so his wife could use the car. Now his wife will always be late for her job and could possibly get fired. Another night supervisor is freaking out because there will be no one he can ask to cover him since nobody was as flexible as me. Two of the night guards now think I'm evil like my departure is some dirty secret and I'm leaving them all behind since I'll no longer be able to accommodate them. One of them called me an evil corporate jackass for moving to head office since can no longer help him get his requested time-offs to spend time with his kids. The other complained about some other bullshit about family emergencies and with me gone he might not be able to effectively find coverage. More grievances were said about how I'm a selfish prick for not telling them earlier about my departure and how evil the company is.\n\n1.5 weeks left until I get out of this hellhole...\n\nEdit: Removed my personal fridge from the SOC this morning. I had brought it for others' convenience when the pandemic started. One of the afternoon guards came to relieve the morning shift and lectured me calling me selfish and complaining about now having no refrigeration for his lunch. Bro...it's mine..."

I also thought the orders I accepted was the TIP only. Not the base pay with tip included. For example, when I signed up earlier today, it said base pay was 21$ an hour. I assume that\u2019s for special populations or full time dashers? Then when I accepted the orders, I thought it was the tip. (I had a 4.75 order, 5.75 order, etc). Turns out no. That\u2019s the base pay + tip. I just feel like I wasted time and money. 2 of my orders didn\u2019t even tip and the others were only 2$ tips.

I\u2019ve always had problems making friends and it\u2019s always bothered me but I never really had the confidence to address my problems. Recently, I had a depressive episode that resulted in me being put on antidepressants.\n\nAnyways, with my medicine in my system, I\u2019m not as \u201chopeless\u201d as I was before, so I want to actively try to make friends, but being a junior in college makes that very hard. Most people already have established friendships at this point so I don\u2019t know where to start.\n\n\nClubs are off limits for a particular reason I can\u2019t really get into (I was in a club before and it ended horribly. There aren\u2019t many other clubs I\u2019m interested in). \n\n\nI want to make friends in my classes since I\u2019m heavy in my major now and I see the same people cycling in and out of my college classes, but I wouldn\u2019t even know where to start trying to befriend people in my classes. How would I start a convo? How would I continue the convo? How would I get it to the point of friendship? Would I keep doing the same repetitive action to capture their attention? Please help!!"

And it also gives us Tomohiro's perspective after running off from Emi's group up until he encounter Kizami. But it'd be interesting if we get chapters that let's us see through the perspectives of Satoshi and Kensuke. Satoshi is already the most boring main character since nothing much happened to him and he has no struggles whatsoever in his stay, so it'd be interesting to see what happened when he and Yuka separated up to the part where he gained consciousness in the main building. As for Kensuke, he, along with Morishige, lived longer than expected for someone who's separated from the group the entire time (might be because they haven't lost their charms that is protecting them from ghost encounters). It would be great if we could have like an hour worth of gameplay for him since his story might be way longer (from the part where he tries to get around to Mitsuki in the second floor, up to his encounter with Kizami). He's been alive for so long that he even see a handful of his friends dead. So yeah, I'm not expecting anymore from this series but I think it'd be better to give us either one of these guys' stories to replace Chapter 15 which is based off a wrong ending."

Does having the charm increase the survivability of the characters from the ghosts but not effective from living beings (Kizami, which could explain why their group falls apart easily)? It also pissed me off that Satoshi was the main character yet did not encounter threats nor had any problems along the way."

How DARE they take such a kind soul away from earth. I'll never forget you, Techno. You helped me through suicide, you helped me through depression, you helped me through anxiety. You helped me through so much. You've done so much. This all doesn't feel real. I thought you were recovering. I thought your chemo was going well, I thought your arm was healing, I thought they figured out a way. I thought you were going to come back to all of us and say \"not even close! Not even close, baby!\" Fuck cancer. FUCK CANCER. Fuck cancer. Fuck cancer. Fuck cancer for taking you away. I love you, Techno. you were someone- you ARE someone i look up to. \n\nTechnoblade never dies, because you still live on in my heart. If i have kids, I'm going to tell them about the man who saved my life even if he didn't know it. You helped me in every possible way.\n\nWanna know my reaction techno?\n\nThis morning. My older sister came into my room and shook me awake, my head was pounding because I had Covid-19. \"Calista! Techno died.\"\n\n\"In a fight right?\" I thought it was just a PVP fight. She shook her head and I had to confirm multiple times, \"died? Passed away-died?\" \n\nI scrambled to my phone immediately, found your YouTube video. \"so long nerds\"\n\nI cried. I cried and I cried and I cried. I cried until I fell asleep. I woke up again and cried again. Technoblade, I cried even more when I saw that merch you made to make fun of everyone. Then I laughed a little, because you probably did it to try to lighten the mood a little even when dead. I barely have any pictures of you. But that's okay. \n\nI've made a diary, where I'll be writing to you and telling you about my day. I know you're up there, but maybe you're reading it along with millions of other ones. Technoblade, thank you for everything.\n\nCancer is horrid. But even if it took your life, I say that you won, Techno.\n\nCancer, fuck you. Technoblade never dies. Just because you took him away physically, doesn't mean he's not here anymore. He's still alive in my heart. And because of you, my heart, millions of hearts, have been set aflame. And because of you, I'm not going to give in to suicide and depression. For Techno, for him, I will continue my life. FUCK YOU CANCER.\n\nSo for now, rest well, Techno. I hope my dogs are playing with you up there, they're both really friendly. I'll see you on the other side one day, but for now, I have life to push through. And I'll push through for you.\n\nI'll laugh and I'll smile just for you.\n\nLong live the King. \ud83d\udc37\ud83c\udf38\n\n- Calista"

Game theory has proven Minecraft is round because the gravity remains the same around the entire world. With all of this information, we can see it takes 24 hours for the sun to revolve around the earth (the earth is around 40 million meters). So in theory, it would take 12 hours to revolve around a 20 million meter planet in the place of the earth (I just halved 24 hours and 40 million meters). Now, add 12 and 24 (40 million meters and 20 million meters which is 60 million meters) to get 36 hours for the sun to revolve around the Minecraft \"infinite\" world.

This process was pretty detailed and my psychologist was sure that this was the case: a lot of the experts that were helping me here in university thought that my behaviour and way of thinking was clearly a sign of autism. At first I didn't feel anything, i was numb to the news, but deep down I knew it made sense and i was relief of having a name for my whole experience. Fast forward until now, we are finally having classes face to face (not online) and, as you can imagine, this has been hell. I been crying non-stop these past few weeks, being in a class makes me sweat and have this sinking feeling in my stomach. Studying is 10x times more difficult, especially considering the amount of group projects i have and presentations.\nThis made me wonder... How i did it before? \nI had a meltdown minutes ago, i started hitting my head like crazy thinking about how much I need to read. I read almost everything, then the teacher decided to add more texts and I lost it, my well crafted plan was ruined in a matter of seconds. \nOn top of that, I needed to re-read more stuff and thats when I cried and started hurting myself.\nMy first thoughts were: \"before the diagnosis you did almost everything, even when you were suffering and now this tiny thing upsets you?\" \nThis made me more angry... And the self harm continued for a few minutes. \nThe thing is... I'm thinking my autism isn't real bc how this can be??? Yeah, before having my diagnosis i was in extreme pain... But somehow I was able to make it but now? I feel like I can't handle \"easy stuff\", noises are annoying, stress puts in such a dark place and i wonder if maybe I'm faking everything???? Of course, i would avoid at all costs to have a meltdown in front of people, which is why I ask for help right away when i feel is coming, i go to a secluded area and cry my eyes out there. But i can't help but believe that maybe my feelings are not real, and i should just suffer.\nI don't know if this is a common experience, but I really need some sort of advice bc I'm alone in this."

In all those sessions he has only asked basic stuff, like my social circles, my family, how my emotions are going and so on, nothing too deep really. I was diagnosed as autistic by psychopedagogue of my university after having the suspicion (with my psychologist) i was in the spectrum, she specializes in autism so i took her words for it. So far, so good... i thought this would be the end of my journey for identity after years of diagnosis that went nowhere. However, today, this psychiatrist i barely know told me he didn't think i was autistic BUT that i have a personality disorder of cluster A. I'm a psychology student, so i know damn well what he was saying. I also know that yes, ASD can overlap with these disorders or be misdiagnosed but i'm really unsure about how he came to this conclusion by asking basic stuff and in so little time. Meanwhile my psychologist and psychopedagogue have been with me for almost 3 years and it took them time to come with the idea that i might be autistic. The thing is: after this call i had a mental breakdown and i suddenly went back to when i was 17 again, completely lost, with a bunch of theories about who i am. I know the psychiatrist doesn't specializes in autism but i still feel like an impostor just by this tiny event. I really feel bad, like a liar, like a traitor... and i don't who to trust here. I don't think is possible to have both things? I been in system for more than 5 years, the amount of labels they have put in me is insane so i feel a little traumatized when it comes to diagnostics, and little by little, even having psychology as my career, I'm losing hope in the field due to my experience. I don't know if someone else has been in this situation... should i trust the person that knows best? sounds logical but my mind is confused... i'm exhausted, i just want answers..."

She always used to tell me that the world is built upon connections, and friends are like allies. Now, as an adult I see the importance of it and i\u2019ve notice how I take seriously how people perceive me or at least try to keep in contact with people, but also giving time to myself. Even having some people think that i was an INFJ at first. \n\n\nBut on the other hand, my mom was a very... random person. She was never on time, always improvising and would change plans all of a sudden just for the sake of it. If she borrowed my stuff, I knew that either I won\u2019t see it again or I would find it scattered around. Somehow this has made me distrust people more: whenever I\u2019m making plans with someone I immediately assume they are going to forget, change their mind, or they\u2019ll never be on time, and I need a backup plan for when that happens. \n\n\nOn the other hand, my dad is an ESTJ and I remember growing up having trouble relating to them or having a meaningful conversation. He used to be super rigid with rules and would get mad at me if I questioned him or just didn\u2019t see the point on blindly obeying everything. As a result, this made me a bit more rebellious (?) with rules, and I immediately distrust anyone who is bossy or with a dictator complex. However, I can recognise he is an extremely reliable person, taught me useful life skills as well as being organised. He also encouraged me to join more sensory activities(?) like sports, as well as being more detail oriented and getting used to establish healthy routines. This may be the reason why I can relate to some introverted sensing traits more than other INTJs, or why when I take a personality test the percentages are usually 40-45% sensing. Deep down, I think he wanted me to behave more like an ISTJ.\n\n\nSorry if this got too long... I suppose that as kids, we tend to absorb our parents traits while at the same time staying true to our personality, so how did you parents/ siblings/ close family members influenced your personality?"

Don't let him gaslight your emotions, feelings, and reality (saying you never had the sober talk). He said he didn't want an open relationship during the convo when you weren't sober, then while sober you both agreed you weren't ready for one. \nIf he downloaded tinder, then obviously there's been a miscommunication on the meaning of \"not ready\", because otherwise , why would he create an account notorious for finding hookups/romantic relationships/ etc.?\nBefore he made one, he should have asked you if you were comfortable with that because in my opinion, if you decided to remain exclusive, creating a dating profile is the gateway for emotional cheating and even physical. The fact he didn't tell you is very disingenuous on his part.\n\nIf you have communicated your sex drive has been low due to stress, he shouldn't add to the stress by being passive aggressive (sulking) about the situation and both parties in the relationship should be communicating about the issue. I honestly find it really off putting when one partner if focused on their needs, they don't consider how the other partner could be feeling and maybe realize this sometimes happens in a relationship and show empathy.\nIt's very hard to already struggle with a low libido when you know your partner would love to be more intimate. The stress of knowing you're not able to perform plus the sulking really can add to the pressure and even be counterintuitive to getting your libido back, especially if they aren't reassuring and supportive, thus making you feel like you have to sexually perform despite not being into it.... it can end up causing feelings of guilt and resentment on your end- and who wants to be intimate with someone when it ends up feeling like a chore and expectation.\n\nIf he can't handle periods where one's libido might be lower due to mental or physical illness and stress, maybe he should realize it's not just about his needs. Maybe he's not mature enough for a committed relationship, and maybe he's not emotionally mature enough to be attentive to your emotional needs, which are very important in a serious, long term relationship.\n\nThis would really make me consider ending the relationship.",

Maybe he needs \"out of the blue\" spelled out for him, but I doubt he's that daft. \n\nWhat he's doing is stonewalling- it's a complete red flag and a huge indicator of divorce. Taking a step back because tensions are high and he needs time to get his emotions in check is one thing. This is not that. This is intentional to manipulate you into feeling in the wrong for feeling violated. Telling you that you overreacted by being firm when he crossed a boundary is teetering on gaslighting. \n\nNot only that, he's making it so YOU'RE in the wrong by refusing to speak because \"you overreacted\". What, does he expect you to apologize for hurting his feelings when he literally overstepped an established boundary? Don't apologize for that. Don't. \n\nThis needs to be discussed immediately.",

All you said is that you were planning something because you WANTED to & that it was nothing big, you just wanted to make the anniversary special because you had a great year with each other. \nIt's very odd his first response was about presents or monetary issues.\n\nI've been with my man for half a decade and he's younger than me by a year. For our first anniversary we were both happy & decided we should so something. Money was never discussed. Like, he could write you a note? He could do loads that have no price, but you literally didn't even mention money. You said you planned something. The end.\n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with being excited. I made a desert, bought tickets to a show, and wrote a letter. He bought me flowers and made me mac& cheese. \n\nYou should ask him about his opinions on things like the significance of anniversaries, holidays, traditions, etc. Maybe he doesn't think 1 year is a lot, but I'm telling you now most people do celebrate the first year. It's important to address conflicts like this because you both need to communicate how you're feeling about your relationship. Do they think it's going well? Do they see it as a long term relationship? \n\nI only date with intentions of marriage, so if my partner was so unenthusiastic and materialistic about things I value for sentiment, I would have to think about if I can come to terms with that, if the other person is willing to put effort into it for my sake (as I would put effort into what my partner finds important even if I don't), or if it's just not the relationship for me. \n\n\nTL;DR\nHe acted immature, not you. You both should communicate where you see your relationship going and where it's currently at. You also should communicate your feelings. If you felt hurt, you should say it. If he gets upset or starts shoving words you've never said in your mouth again- run.",

But the thing is, it\u2019s always changing. I don\u2019t even realize it until it\u2019s already happened and i would look back and realize \u2018oh wait i changed\u2019. And it\u2019s not like I change every two years or even months. I could literally look back at the mindset I was in a week ago and see a drastic change in the attitude and the person i was a week ago feels distant, like it happened three months ago, not five days. \nAnd as for personality, I DO have had some pretty drastic changes in personality during the past three years, and i always seem to forget who I was or what I did back then. There are Many times where my friend would ask me \u2018do you remember two/three years ago when you.....\u2019 and if i can\u2019t find that act bizzare to the person i am right now (in another word, it\u2019s something the person i am right now would never do or could not even imagine doing) i would find myself having ABSOLUTE no memory of it.\nI just wanna know what\u2019s wrong with me. Can anyone please help? Also thank you for putting up with my poor english.",

I read that mutons will appear in May if you haven't completed the interrogation by then and I really think I would've been able to handle that mission if I had just one or two more research projects (Titan armour and a primary laser weapon) completed.\n\nWould it help if I took as much time as possible to get in as much research as I can before advancing each stage of the story/engaging the next wave of new aliens?"

But for the next 4 battles I entered, I got TPKed every time because the enemies hit at least 75% of their shots and around 2/3 of them were Crits.

Coming to IT, idk *anything* about programming, I'm new to all this.\n* If we think about the future prospects, some say that the ECE industry is gonna flourish in a few years with nanotech and stuff.

Well damnit, I honestly don't know what interests me, and my deadline to choose is nearing. \n* There's a plausibility of me getting ECE in a slightly better college (G Narayanamma, Hyd) and IT in another college (BVRIT women's college, Hyd), which, I wouldn't say is bad (the placements are very good here).\n* I'm not sure about what to do after engineering, but in this moment, my mind's mostly leaning towards going ahead with MS abroad...idk if I wanna do it in CS or in something else.\n\nKeeping all these points in mind..what do you suggest I do now?

                "body": "Hi.\n\nI understand that this post might be more appropriate for the designated *Sonic Frontiers* subreddit, but, if isn\u2019t too much to ask for, please bear with me; it has been challenging for me, even when I\u2019ve really tried to be respectful and transparent, to simply convey opinions in the sectors of Reddit where the more volatile of the *Sonic the Hedgehog fan base* reside\u2014 I hope I can connect my expressed thoughts to a larger conversation of gaming.\n\n**Contextualizing my Preferences**\n\n- Alright, when to the comes to admittedly arbitrarily made separation between more open-ended, exploratory video games and those that are more structured and linear, I ultimately prefer the latter for its more controlled, engaging sense of fun, whereas I generally find myself caught between either boredom or feeling overwhelmed by the former.\n\n- Because of my gameplay preferences, I was initially feeling doubtful that the emphasis on exploration that *Sonic Frontiers* publicized wouldn\u2019t mesh well, which is okay as video games do not HAVE to cater to my preferences, but after having played the video game itself on and off after having been generously gifted it during the holidays, I have been pleasantly surprised.\n\n- Now, from what I understand, that the *Sonic the Hedgehog* franchise in general has been levied the stigma of being the best, most prominent \u201cmediocre\u201d franchise in the industry that serves as a decent distraction next to the \u201cactual titans of gameplay design\u201d, but I sincerely feel that *Sonic Frontiers* - even if it\u2019s just potential - has very strong ideas that, if further developed and worked upon, can contribute significantly to gaming in general.\n\n**Cyberspace Levels**\n\n- Alright, the more sophisticated and mature of YouTube analysts on Sonic video games have described that essential *Core Tenets* of Sonic gameplay are *Speed*, *Platforming*, and *Exploration* (which may technically be more applicable to the classic, 2D games, but I think there\u2019s still interesting potential to be found in seeing how the *Core Tenets* theoretically manifest in 3D Sonic \u2014 I\u2019d recommend the following YouTube channels for a more in-depth analysis into the *Core Tenets* of Sonic: [theKazeblade](https://youtu.be/xLJSRJfZkRk) and [ShayMay](https://youtu.be/-AK3n-srj5E)).\n\n- As far as the *Core Tenets* for *Sonic Frontiers* goes, I understand that the game emphasizes a reinvigorated approach to the *Exploration* tenet, but something I have admittedly been yearning to see a bit more of in *Sonic the Hedgehog* video games is an emphasis on the *Platforming* tenet; I feel that *Sonic Frontiers*, for the most part, at least makes a commendable effort to include more involved platforming.\n\n- It\u2019s not my intention to stroke myself over my own Reddit content\u2014 I mean to hopefully  use a constructive allegory by linking a response to a post of mine on the designated subreddit for *Sonic Frontiers* that [encouraged me to rethink how I perceive the game\u2019s Cyberspace levels](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicFrontiers/comments/zx23o8/my_first_impressions/j1yj438/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) by seeing Sonic\u2019s floaty aerial physics as something to take advantage of; thanks to the response\u2019s input, the Cyberspace levels have now come to make for my favorite parts of *Sonic Frontiers*, not only for their more contained, structured gameplay, but also how there seems to be more trust put into the player to take advantage of the Air Boost ability of Sonic\u2019s to strategically make jumps and cover extensive airtime, making for a truly engaging platforming experience in itself.\n\n**The \u201cMini Levels\u201d in the Open Zones**\n\n- The component of the gameplay of *Sonic Frontiers* that has made for the most pleasant surprise for me has been the presence of the \u201cMini Levels\u201d (the floating arrangement of the platforms, springs, grinding rails, booster panels, etc that are scattered within and throughout the Open Zones) as they provide me with the structured, controlled, and arcade appeal of  platforming gameplay.\n\n- Given their abundance, I IMMENSELY appreciate how these \u201cMini Levels\u201d provide for a mostly optional alternative to a given process of getting from point A to point B without being overwhelmed by the disorganized landscape or bored by the more monotonous form of travel; maybe such has already been the case in more open-ended, exploratory video games that I have yet to realize, but I sincerely feel that *Sonic Frontiers* really has something going for it with this idea of \u201cMini Levels\u201d as an alternative form of exploration.\n\n- I\u2019ll try to use a theoretical, alternative version of *The Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild* (BOTW) as an example of the potential application of the \u201cMini Levels\u201d of *Sonic Frontiers*; I know that BOTW already has its signature Shrines serve as \u201cfast travel waypoints\u201d, but what I feel would be especially neat is if the Shrines themselves were all interconnected with each other to form a technologically advanced, interconnected, and structured underground  labyrinth with traversal puzzles and combat as an alternative to the more open air exploration of Hyrule Kingdom on the surface.\n\nThanks for reading."

                "body": "Hi.\n\nSonic Frontiers was generously gifted to me this recent holiday time and as such, I\u2019ve been playing it on and off for the past couple of days; if it\u2019s alright, please, I would like to detail my immediate thoughts about it.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\n- Playing as Sonic: I absolutely must commend the depth of options and accessibility the game provides, I feel as if that is absolutely the best option for cultivating a more positively received 3D Sonic experience in the future\u2014 letting the player adjust and determine how they wish to be able to experience the game.\n\n- The World: I\u2019m admittedly generally not one for open-ended, exploratory gameplay as I much prefer structured and more linear level design, but I really appreciate what Sonic Frontiers does with its abundance of mini levels and puzzles to help keep me engaged along the way.\n\n- Cyberspace: Now, I really appreciate what the Cyberspace levels attempt to do on paper; it\u2019s very nice to have linear, more traditionally arcade levels present as it is what I ultimately prefer, but it\u2019s just a shame how wonky and floaty Sonic is to play as\u2014 I understand the need to restrict the arsenal of adjustment options, but for Cyberspace, the restriction might\u2019ve been better suited for tighter physics.\n\n- Combat: This might require an adjustment of mindset on my part, but when it comes to Sonic, I\u2019m ultimately in it for the platforming-related - running and jumping - gameplay; meaning that the complicated nature of the combat is a little much for me, but I do appreciate the role the Cyloop ability contributes to combat scenarios.\n\n- Otherwise\u2026: Again, my preference has always been for a more structured, straightforward linear platforming experience from Sonic, but I appreciate that there\u2019s such an abundance of awards to different things that I can comfortably get away with focusing on the Cyberspace levels and mini obstacle courses/puzzles without glossing over significant content.\n\n**Narrative/Other Features**\n\n- World\u2019s Aesthetic: I just gotta say that I am absolutely for the aesthetic of the world as I am a sucker for technology\u2014 the architectural structures, the robots, and their presence in the world is just really appealing to me.\n\n- Story: \u2026I admittedly do not much care for the storyline here, especially as I was sort of overzealous in having watched part of a walkthrough on Sonic Frontiers on YouTube; I just wish the ostentatiously somber cutscenes were put on the back burner in favor of strictly environmental storytelling for the player to discover on their own terms through the gameplay.\n\n- Super Sonic: In my recent sit down with the game, I admittedly found the boss battle with Giganto to be annoying spectacle that interferes with the mechanical soundness of the gameplay; however, again, I cannot deny my appreciation for robots and Giganto being a gizmo-chad certainly appealed to me.\n\n- Technological Ambiance: I know that most people seem to be in it for the lyrical rock music far as audio-related enjoyment goes, but I am all for and am just a sucker for all of the technological sounds and ambiance of the game, such as opening portals to Cyberspace or the sounds the map screen makes.\n\n- Otherwise\u2026: I like the Koko as the denizens of Starfall islands, but I feel like their technically being the cycling reincarnations of the Ancients instead of being their own thing is ridiculous and just goes to show the wonky nature of establishing \u201cSonic lore\u201d.\n\nThanks for reading."

We get by just fine but the more tensions rise the more I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nIt felt like just five years ago people were asking genuine questions and at least having a little bit of patience with the concept of transness. Even my dad listened to me back then when I explained how gender dysphoria works when he was transphobic one time. But now, the questions are prepackaged. \u201cWhat is a woman?\u201d \u201cAre you ok with kids mutilating themselves?\u201d \u201cHow do you feel about men being in women\u2019s prisons?\u201d \n\nNo longer questions about the concept of being trans but more so about the perceived danger of cis people/children. I am no longer explaining what it means to be trans and am instead trying to explain why our death rates get mislabeled, why p*dophilia is not related to transness, and the fact that it is a huge pain to get a surgery as an ADULT let alone as a child. They come with their own pre installed misconceptions that are far worse than they were years prior. \n\nThis worries me because I have a very easily fooled family. I ask myself every day\u2026 what article will come out that causes my parents to suddenly think I\u2019m disgusting or irredeemable? Will Fox News, who my parents watch regularly, come out with more misinformation that will drive me even further from my parents? \n\nAt this point, if they are foolish enough to trust a man on TV over their own child, I think I\u2019ve done all I can."

I prefer they/them. \n\nBut when it comes to my name, even though I was given a very feminine one, I do not see it as gendered. I was given a very old and unique feminine name, one that has always resonated with me and also because I rarely ever heard it for anyone else. It felt like *my* name, but also it didn\u2019t at the same time, since it was so feminine. \n\nI tried a few nicknames, all of which were sort of created from my given name and thus were also feminine. Being agender, I struggled to see what made my name feminine. To me, it was just a very lovely name that I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind much. \n\nBut people are surprised by this or (I think) question my legitimacy of being trans? Because my deadname doesn\u2019t feel like a deadname. Am I not truly trans? I don\u2019t feel anything negative about my given name, I\u2019m mostly thankful my parents tried to be creative. I feel bad parting with my name and so I\u2019m comfortable with people who knew me before still using it. But I do have a new name that I use, which can confuse people I think. \n\n(Because I am not bothered by my given name, I sometimes call it my \u201chalf alive\u201d name when people call it my deadname. Is this offensive or trivializing other trans experiences?)"

Last summer, she became manic and continued to consume cannabis without a care in the world. Well, she developed psychosis without any of us really noticing because she was saying she wasn\u2019t manic. \n\nI had little to no knowledge of mania and psychosis so when my friend told me that my girlfriend was showing signs of psychosis, I tried to get her parents to take her to a doctor. They refused. My girlfriend is queer and they instead just blamed this situation on her being queer. As though her *not* being queer would cure her psychosis/mania. \n\nHer therapist had said she had bipolar but had never done anything for it. She told her that her biggest concern was her ADHD and not her bipolar. Well, her bipolar almost ruined her life, took all her money, and got her in really risky situations. She cheated on me, yelled at her mom for money, let strangers move into her apartment she wasn\u2019t paying for (and they destroyed it), etc. She was also very verbally and sometimes physically aggressive when we\u2019d have arguments. \n\nShe never hurt me- just sort of grab my shoulders/body with a sense of urgency. It was clear to me that her aggression was unwanted and something she couldn\u2019t stop. She also wouldn\u2019t sleep for *long* stretches of time and began to write in hypergraphia. I was becoming really terrified that my girlfriend of three years would never be the same again. She eventually slowed down months ago, and she really regrets everything that happened (much of it she struggles to recall) \n\nDoes anyone here have any tips on mentally recovering after a loved one experiences psychosis? When she was going through this, I felt so alone and helpless. This is the second time a long term partner of mine showed signs of psychosis (the first time it was someone else and I left) and now I\u2019m beginning to feel an intrinsic caution around relationships and even people in general. I wonder if the person I\u2019m getting to know will one day yell at me, lie to me, or just generally forget about my existence on occasion when it\u2019s important. \n\nI have offered to break things off with my girlfriend by the way- she just doesn\u2019t want to be alone right now and I think she doesn\u2019t remember all that happened. Her parents are not supportive and we moved not too long ago. I\u2019m just exhausted and looking for recovery advice."

But I still think about it. It all happened really quickly and without any preparation. While I was doing dishes just now I got stressed thinking about it and I felt like maybe it would be a good idea to tell the story and get it written out. \n\nMy girlfriend is a transfem nonbinary person and I am an agender nonbinary person and we once made another openly queer friend many years ago. This friend lived around an hour away from us with her dad. We went to visit her at his house a few times and everything seemed to be going well. \n\nThe house was nice but very rural. We were out on the highway and it was quite old. He was on the older side as well but was very friendly. I didn\u2019t get any bad vibes from him and he made an effort to be kind and gender at least my girlfriend correctly from what I remember. I just couldn\u2019t imagine a homophobe gendering a trans person correctly so I guess he slipped under my radar. \n\n>!That is, of course, until he walked into the living room one time wearing a tank top and I noticed he had a tattoo of a swastika.!< I noted this to my girlfriend and she was obviously alarmed as well. When we left, we took the girl we met with us because the plan was to hang out for a few nights. He had said this was ok.\n\nWe asked her about the tattoo and she said she didn\u2019t know but that he must not agree with those opinions since he\u2019s fine with her being gay. (Keep in mind that she had not reunited with him for a while and didn\u2019t know him for much of her life.) While we were gone, he started texting her more and more. He was demanding that we bring her home. I did not like this and personally did not want to go back because of what we had learned about him. We had planned that she stay another night with us so we didn\u2019t have the gas anyways at the time to drive her back. So we told her that we\u2019d take her back the next day. I had enough to get her back if it was an emergency, but I didn\u2019t want to spend that as I wanted to use it for work. \n\nAnyways, he continued to text and text and finally he began to threaten to set her personal belongings on fire, including personal documents. She started to ask that we bring her back home. We decided we should considering he was starting to text very threatening things about us and we didn\u2019t want to be accused of keeping his daughter away from him. Keep in mind she was 20 at the time and we were 21 and 20. He was talking to her as though she was a child and was telling us we were responsible for taking her home. \n\nWe got there and he was already throwing things into a fire. I went inside with her to help her get her things because she was afraid to go by herself. I took pepper spray with me. I had no idea what to do- this guy hadn\u2019t shown any homophobia up to this point. I had JUST discovered his tattoo today. I didn\u2019t have time to tell police about this guy and frankly, I didn\u2019t trust police. I just didn\u2019t want this girl to lose all her childhood items and personal documents because her dad\u2019s freaking losing it. Looking back, I shouldn\u2019t have gone inside. \n\nSo while I\u2019m inside, I tell my girlfriend to sit in the back and wait. I\u2019m holding my spray the entire time and he\u2019s screaming at her, talking about my girlfriend and I. He\u2019s yelling about how we\u2019re disgusting, how we\u2019re mentally unstable and trying to take her away from him, and about how we\u2019re druggies and pedophiles. Whenever he\u2019d see me, he\u2019d scream that he knew I was a pedophile and that he was going to find my computers and my personal files to find cp. I rushed from room to hallway trying to fill trash bags with her personal items. \n\nHe got more and more heated the longer I lingered. I could tell by the tone of his voice and his body language. Just as I could feel something was boiling over, I made my way towards the door. Without saying anything to her, I was respectfully done pushing the envelope with this guy. I didn\u2019t want to see what he had to do or hear what he had to say. As I was walking towards the door, I could hear footsteps approaching me. I walked faster. In this situation, I was rounding a corner and going through a kitchen and through a laundry room and out a door to the outside- where my car is. \n\nHe is quickly approaching behind me. I have no idea what he has planned but I know it isn\u2019t good. He continues yelling and I reach the door at the end of the laundry room- I honestly thought I\u2019d get stuck at the first door. I was so so so lucky because I reached the door frame to the outside and that\u2019s where he stopped me. He caught me between the door frame, half of my body was outside and half was inside, and he had me pinned up to the doorframe while holding an axe pressed up against my thigh. He was screaming \u201cGET OUT OF MY HOUSE!\u201d and I finally managed to say \u201cI\u2019M TRYING!\u201d before he let me go and I ran to my car. \n\nI told my girlfriend he tried to hit me with an axe and we decided to finally resort to calling police. The entire time her dad was screaming at us that he planted meth in our car, that he had friends who would find us and kill us, and that if we called the police we\u2019d have no help since he has friends in the force. The sheriff came and thankfully explained that the situation is very personal. But the reality of being told all those things still happened. I still feel like this is how some people view me and my girlfriend. \n\nThe sheriff asked me if I wanted to press charges. I asked him if a college student has the time to charge someone with assault right now. He said probably not. I agreed and we went on our way, all three of us as she chose to stay with us. Police thankfully scared him enough to get him to stop the threats and violent behavior. \n\nAnyways, that\u2019s my most damaging experience besides growing up Catholic, and I don\u2019t know how to process it. I still have nightmares every so often about the axe and his yelling. And the more I try to explore my queerness the more those words from him echo in my head. It reminds me of when my dad told me I can\u2019t be gay because it will lead to beastiality and pedophilia, and even as a 14 yr old I told him that that\u2019s not possible since children and animals can\u2019t consent. \n\nI just want to heal. Does anyone have any advice for moving on from experiences like this and finding peace in your queerness? It has prevented me from feeling able to connect with my queerness more and after a year or so I\u2019m starting to feel tired of it.\n\nEdit: Made a few edits for potential triggers"

                "body": "It is said that when one works in an abattoir long enough, one goes deaf to the blood and guts of slaughter. In the much-hyped Nehru vs Sardar surround sound, there are certain urban legends that prevail.\n\nTo believe everything that one hears and reads now is much like meshugas. Truth cannot be patinated. Once injected with the truth serum of history, a new strain emerges.\n\nMuch has been written about the ruptures between the twin leaders of the national freedom movement -- Sardar Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru -- and more so on the fractures that appeared in running the country after India attained independence.\n\nObviously, both were chosen by Gandhiji himself to lead the country as heir apparents, Nehru being much younger than Patel. Both were tall leaders who commanded enormous respect for their role in the independence struggle. Many people have many takes on this cleft. Yes there were differences of opinion, obviously when men of the stature of Nehru and Sardar Patel are involved, that is bound to happen.\n\nWhen the Defence Committee waited for V.P. Menon and Sam Manekshaw to return from Jammu with the signed Instrument of Accession and Nehru vacillated -- even as Sheikh Abdullah sitting in the ante room of the PM's residence on York Road slipped in a note to him saying that Kashmir would be lost forever if the Indian Army wasn't airlifted on priority as the marauders had virtually reached the gates of Srinagar burning the power station at Mahura and Maharaja Hari Singh had fled to the plains of Jammu -- it was Sardar who asked Nehru: \"Jawahar, Kashmir chahiye ki nahin?\" But both leaders were level headed and chose to work together for nation-building.\n\nV.P. Menon, who worked in complete synchronicity with Sardar Patel on the crucial issue of integrating the Princely States, says this about the Iron Man of India:\n\n\"Leadership is of two kinds -- a leader like Napoleon, who was master of both policy and detail, wanted merely the instruments to carry out his orders. Sardar's leadership was of a different category -- having selected his men, he trusted them entirely to implement his policy without full and frank consultation. Whenever we entered into any discussion, we did so as personal friends rather than minister and secretary (in the Ministry of States).\"\n\nP.N. Chopra, who dealt with the selected works of Patel extensively across several volumes, says: \"The differences between Sardar and Nehru perhaps might not have aggravated but for certain elements such as Mridula Sarabhai, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai and a few others in the Congress Party.\"\n\nRajmohan Gandhi, who has done extensive work on Sardar Patel, sums up the aperture while reviewing Patel's daughter Maniben's book on her father based on her jottings in a diary, in his own biography of the Sardar, \"Patel: A Life\".\n\nHe pulls no punches on the fabled rivalry between Nehru and Patel. History tells us that the conflict was acute, but Rajmohan Gandhi dispels this notion by quoting from history. Patel, who had used sharp language for Nehru, was also the one who had written to Jawaharlal in August 1947: \"My services will be at your disposal, I hope, for the rest of your life and you will have unquestioned loyalty ... from me ... Our combination is unbreakable and therein lies our strength.\"\n\nOf course there were differences of opinion between the two -- more so because their style of functioning was different -- but Sardar, as is clear from his public comments, always stood by Nehru.\n\nOn February 4, 1948, after the Mahatma's assassination, Vallabhbhai, the Deputy Prime Minister, who was 14 years older than Nehru, called Jawaharlal \"my leader\" in a speech to Congress MPs and added: \"I am one with the Prime Minister on all national issues. For over a quarter of a century both of us sat at the feet of our master and struggled together for the freedom of India. It is unthinkable today, when the Mahatma is no more, that we should quarrel.\"\n\nThat such an agreement and unity existed, and that it survived until Patel's death in December 1950, will not of course be believed by any who only read Patel's stark comments about Nehru in the Maniben diaries.\n\nNo doubt Maniben only recorded what she heard, but in this volume the remarks are presented without any reference to their context, according to Rajmohan Gandhi. (Moreover, the editing is such that in many cases it is impossible to make out whether a barbed remark is Patel's or that of a visitor, or where the remark was made.)\n\nRajmohan Gandhi wrote: \"The Patel-Nehru conflicts are well known. At the end of 1949, when the first President for the Republic had to be found, Nehru wanted Rajaji but after an initial ambivalence Patel supported Rajendra Prasad, who was chosen.\n\n\"In August 1950, the Sardar was again on the winning side, and Nehru on the losing, when Purshottam Das Tandon won a contest for the Congress presidentship, defeating Acharya Kripalani, whom Nehru had backed. Bitter words marked both contests, but the relationship did not break.\n\n\"If unaware of other facts, the reader of these diary entries will believe that over Kashmir, Hyderabad and the Indo-Pak Pact of 1950, the Nehru-Patel differences were unbridgeable. But were they? While disliking the reference of Kashmir to the UN, Patel went along with the removal of Hari Singh, the empowerment of Sheikh Abdullah and the provision of Article 370.\n\n\"As for the Nehru-Liaqat Pact of April 1950, over which Shyama Prasad Mookerjee resigned from the Union cabinet, Patel pledged his 'whole strength and energy to making a success of the Agreement and vindicating the stand of the Prime Minister,' and he also pointed out that \"ugly and deplorable incidents from our side\" had \"weakened our position\".\n\n\"On his part, though unsure of the timing of Patel's Hyderabad operation, Nehru went along with it. Historically, which is more remarkable -- the Patel-Nehru differences, which were undoubtedly important, or the fact that the two stayed together? Those riveted only by the differences have to face some ambiguities.\n\n\"Thus in the Diary, Patel says conflicting things about Kashmir. While on July 23, 1949, he seems to want to do \"battle for the whole of Kashmir\" (p.291), on September 27, 1950, referring to Kashmir, the Sardar tells R.K. Patil: \"Now how long can India bear this burden.\" (p. 425).\n\n\"Questions about what Patel 'really' thought on an issue cannot be resolved by referring to the Diary.\"\n\nIn a public statement on April 7, 1947, Patel captured the prevailing sentiment best when he said: \"Our leader in uprooting British rule was Gandhiji, in administration, our leader is Jawaharlal Nehru, his cleverness, efficiency and sacrifice are incomparable. I have gone there to serve Jawaharlalji as loyally as I have served Gandhiji, it is my duty to help according to my capacity and I am doing that.\" (P.N. Chopra, 'Collected Works of Patel', Volume 12).\n\nA discordant note is run by A.G. Noorani while writing in 'Frontline' magazine. He claims that Patel wasn't the real Bismarck, but Lord Mountbatten was the real fulcrum behind the integration of the Princely States:\n\n\"Credit for the crucial phase of the integration of the princely states belongs mainly to the Viceroy and Governor-General, Lord Mountbatten, and his Constitutional Adviser, V.P. Menon. Patel played a supportive and ancillary role.\n\n\"The task was outsourced by him with the Cabinet's full authorisation to Mountbatten.\n\n\"The two White Papers on Indian states, published by the Ministry of States over which he presided, record the two distinct phases of the process of integration.\n\n\"One was their accession to India before Independence on August 15, 1947, abandoning for good all pretensions to independent statehood on the lapse of the 'paramountcy' of the British Crown. It was a bogus doctrine which British colonialists conveniently evolved with the support of their pliable lawyers.\n\n\"No one refuted it more devastatingly than did Dr B.R. Ambedkar on the eve of Independence. This first phase, the accession, before August 15, 1947, was of crucial importance. Jinnah egged on the states to declare themselves independent and thus Balkanise India. Mountbatten foiled his plans.\n\n\"The next phase, that of integration with federal India, was plain sailing. The princes were, as it were, lodged in the harem. Those who were small needed slight cajoling to sign agreements for merger with the Provinces of the erstwhile British India; the medium ones formed Unions; the large ones stood alone like the other states.\"\n\n(Sandeep Bamzai is the Editor-In-Chief of IANS and author of 'Princestan: How Nehru, Patel and Mountbatten Made India' (Rupa), which won the Kalinga Literary Festival (KLF) Book Award 2020-21 in the non-fiction category.)"

I also tried searching this group for posts about the shot and I think I did it right (I'm usually a mobile user) but I didn't get many helpful posts.*\n\nInfo about me to help with possible suggestions or advice: I'm 21 nearly 22, haven't had kids yet but have been briefly pregnant once, currently no underlying physical health issues, and have issues with anxiety, paranoia, depression, and CPTSD (mostly since around 12-14) but not currently on medication.\n\nI got the kyleena IUD in October 2018 after not being able to consistently keep up with remembering to take my pills every day and at the same time. It's been great not having a period and not having to worry about remembering something, but my sex drive has suffered greatly with this IUD. I basically almost never want to do it and sometimes I feel like I need to convince myself to. Being in my \"sexual prime\" (lol sorry if that sounds weird, I don't want to come off as ageist by saying \"being young\") and in a long-term relationship, I don't want to be having issues with my libido just yet. Sometimes it really weighs on me that I don't want to have sex as often as I would *like to* want to. My mental health did go even more south after I got the IUD, but I've also been going through a lot the past few years personally, so I'm not sure if the regression of my mental health can be directly related to my birth control. I also don't like being almost constantly anxious that the IUD will misplace or expel somehow, or the discomfort I sometimes feel when I do have sex.\n\nI've been trying to look into other options for me since I don't think an IUD is the best at this point in time and I need something since I live with my boyfriend and we don't want kids just yet (but possibly in 2+ years). So far I'm leaning towards the depo shot. It's not something I'd have to remember to do every day and it lasts 3 months. I don't really want anything implanted or something I have to insert and I want it to be at least 90%+ effective. I don't like how hormonal birth control messes with our bodies so much but I realize those are most of our more convenient options that don't interfere with pleasure or sensitivity. Can anyone with experience with the shot give me any advice or comments? I know each method affects everyone differently, but I want to hear from you guys what I could plan to possibly expect. I'll still do research and consult a doctor, obviously.\n\nAlso if you think I would like another method based on my post then feel free to make whatever suggestions you think would help me. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to answer!"

I\u2019ve never submitted in a writing contest, so I\u2019m pretty ignorant on how they work, but have had the idea on a back burner for the past year bc I know it would be great for me, but of course I need money for the submission fees.\n\nI have some poems I plan on submitting to this magazine (poetry category is 5 poems max), one of which is probably one of my favorite poems I\u2019ve ever written (so far). Not to seem biased, but I do believe it has good potential. Then I last minute started overthinking (my submission is due tonight in a few hours) and wondered if I\u2019ll regret submitting that poem if it gets picked to be published bc what if there\u2019s another contest in the future that I want to submit my poem to but I can\u2019t bc of restrictions against published poems and/or poems that have been placed in previous contests? Not only that, I do hope to publish a book of poems in the future and plan on including that one. Am I overthinking it? I probably am bc, hello, just write more awesome poems for future contests! I\u2019m getting back into writing after being on a kind of hiatus, so I\u2019m probably subconsciously worrying I\u2019ll never write anything I consider just as good (love crippling insecurities). Anyway, is this something people wonder/worry about? Please be nice, I really don\u2019t know how writing contests work and how it works when your work is published by someone or wins a contest.

Honestly though, It's a more intense genre and it can be a little too much for some people, but hardstyle has some of the most beautiful, powerful, and spine-chilling melodies I've ever heard. It almost feels being outside and admiring a powerful storm. The kicks are the thunder, the melody is the lightning, the chill you get is the wind, and the rush of emotions you feel is the rain!\n\nI highly recommend watching [Hardstyle Top 25 | DEDIQATED | 20 Years of Q-dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTloqMbOO_Y) to get a good taste of what hardstyle is all about. It has a lot of amazing classics and some newer picks as well!",

                "body": "\"Zyzz hardstyle\" is imitation hardstyle. It's kind of like comparing stale pizza flavored crackers to a freshly cooked pizza made from scratch. At it's worst, it just takes the most recognizable element from hardstyle, the kick drums, and adds them to sped up existing pop songs. Like nightcore, it's usually just a quick edit that anyone with music editing software can do. At it's best, it sounds like an amateur just producing their first few tracks back in 2007-2010.\n\nThere are different subgenres and styles of hardstyle, and the random noise without a tune you're referring to is probably rawstyle, a subgrene thats more dark and influenced by hardcore, or maybe even reverse bass/early hardstyle. I'm a huge fan of both hardstyle and dubstep, and like dubstep, hardstyle tends to be on the loud and aggressive side of music, and focuses more on the music than the lyrics (if there is any), but unlike a lot of dubstep, which heavily focuses on crazy sound design and rhythm, hardstyle has some of the most beautiful, powerful, and spine-chilling melodies I've ever heard. For a good taste of what hardstyle has to offer, I suggest watching [Hardstyle Top 25 | DEDIQATED | 20 Years of Q-dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTloqMbOO_Y). It has a lot of great classics and some newer picks as well.\n\nIf you like pop remixes, you'll probably like euphoric hardstyle. It's melodic, upbeat, and often features pop-like lyrics. Artists like Darren Styles, Wasted Penguins, Da Tweekaz, Brennan Heart, and Wildstylez come to mind. They also do remixes of popular songs well.\n\nIf you really like zyzz hardsyle, then you do you, but just know that's hated on by a lot people who actually listen to hardstyle.",

It's barely any longer than the shoulder length medium bob. Personally I'm not a fan of the way it looks with the blunt bangs and hair tucked behind the ears, so it feels strange having to pick a shorter hair option for first time. I love how hairstyles are no longer locked to gender, but it seems strange to remove most of the longer hairstyle options like the last three generations had. I wonder if there was a problem with the hair clipping through the clothes and accessories. Maybe it was an intentional design choice to make the player character looking younger since they're a kid in school. Maybe Game Freak is secretly against guys being able to have long hair lol. Idk, What do you guys think?"

We want to see the games succeed not just for our own benefit as consumers, but for the well being of the franchise we all know and love. It's sad to see the main games, the core of the franchise, being handled this way. It's like watching a loved one make bad decision after bad decision as their life spirals downhill. We don't know the whole story behind the development and why these decisions were made, but it's clear artistry and quality are not top priority.\n\n Because almost every aspect of the franchise relies on the content introduced in the main games, I suspect the Pokemon Company has limited Game Freak with very tight deadlines given the yearly release cycle. This, along with Game Freak's intentionally small size and their apparent lack of skill and experience when it comes to 3D game development severally limits what's possible in the given time frame.\n\n From the state Scarlet and Violet are in, it's obvious that they were very rushed, sacrificing polish, optimization, quality control, and likely features and game design just to meet deadlines. Botched releases unfortunately happen from time to time, but sadly this is the standard with Game Freak. What's worse is that unlike most game devs who work to continually release major patches and updates to fix and improve gameplay (No Man's Sky and Cyberpunk 2077 for example), Game Freak takes a very hands off \"it is what it is\" approach, and unless it's a major game breaking bug, it will likely never get fixed. \n\nIt's very frustrating to see the all potential go to waste year after year. The games are finally starting to take steps in the right direction, but they're baby steps and Game Freak keeps tripping and faceplanting in the process as they continue to fall further and further behind."

I know the concepts of \"divine timing\" and living/feeling as if you already have what you're manifesting, but I can't help but to feel as if what I'm manifesting is \"Plan A\", the main story of my life, and this whole time I've been having to make due with \"Plan B, C, and D\", the tedious side quests, until \"Plan A\" finally manifests. This has left me with a feeling of longing, waiting and waiting until the day comes when everything happens and I can finally truly start living my purpose. I'm at a period in my life where I'm experiencing an existential crisis and some depression because I'm trying to figure out the next step in my life, but things feel so out of my control right now. I feel like there's not much I can do except continue to trust that everything has, and is going to work out way better than I could ever imagine. So, I guess what my question really is, how do you feel truly satisfied with life when the 3d reality doesn't yet reflect the truth, even after many years?

So, sometimes I'll get a hankering for writing a letter when I've been drinking beer (or wine, or hard seltzer) and it feels wholly inappropriate to impose my drunken ramblings (or buzzed blathering) on anyone I know in real life or any pen pals who are trying to have a legitimate pen pally relationship.  So, I guess I'm looking for someone who is like the pen pal equivalent of a bar buddy?  This feels like a weird ask but I'm sure I have a tipsy counterpart out there somewhere.  Bonus points if we're close-ish in age--also, I'm only looking for women to write to.\n\nAbout me:\n\n   - I like crafting, reading (on my 24th book of 2020!), podcasts (favorites: Reply all, Overdue, Criminal, Case File, The Allusionist, Ear hustle, Freakonomics), MBTI & Enneagram personality typing systems (if it means anything to you, I'm a 9w1 INTP), and true crime.  \n\n   \n-Favorite shows: The Good Place, The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, plenty of other shows I'm not coming up with right now.  Moviewise I'm trapped in the Aughts.  Seems like I just binge shows but movies feel like this whole THING I have to commit to.\n\n- I have a 13 year old daughter and I will probably write short bits about mothery shit so if you're really intensely child-free in a I-hate-breeders sort of way, probably not the best match.  That being said, most of my friends are child free (just not assholes) and I don't treat being a mom as central to all the things I have to say.\n\n-This is probably too much information for you?  If you need more, stalk my profile, maybe.  Or ask me questions here.  I think I'm mostly nice but I bet I've been an asshole on reddit here and there so maybe an accurate view on my me-ness?\n\nok. Come at me if you wanna exchange some drinky snail mail."

PetSmart has a pretty affordable 5 gal kit with everything you need in it (filter, heater, thermometer, and net) except d\u00e9cor and water testing stuff (but petsmart will test water for free once you get the tank set up and cycled). Very soft plants such as silk plants are recommended (I don't recommend live plants yet for a first time owner). I would get smaller gravel rather than those big pebbles at the bottom of its current tank, I find those harder to keep clean.\n\nIf your feeding it pellets, watch to make sure it can actually eat them and they aren't too hard or big. I like feeding flakes and then using bloodworms as treats every once in a while.\n\nI'd give tips/recs on cycling your tank and everything for when you set it up (cause it really does need a bigger tank, they're actually easier to take care of anyway), but it depends on the size you get and stuff. When you're ready though, make sure you do some research on either a fish-in or a normal water cycle, whichever you decide, to set up the tank.\n\n\nAlso a lesser-known small tip: I recommend getting a small day-night cycle light for a tank. It mimics a more natural light cycle and looks pretty neat. Having a light on in the tank constantly can stress out the fish.",

I assume that since this is just the first week, this will be light in comparison to later in the course.)\n\nI am taking 2 other classes aside from this one, one of which is a 5 credit hour class that meets online and in person, why is her 3 credit hours class requiring 2-3x more work than my other two classes combined?

And I've found that wearing patterns, cuts and colours you like somehow help with self esteem. Little accessories like bracelets may also help.\n\n3. reading/watching/researching about the transgender experience.

My parents want me to go because they didn't have the opportunity to (my dad voluntarily skipped it though to go hang out with his friends).\n\nI'm not here for advice but I'll probably be skipping the formal next year :/ which sucks because all my friends are cis(hets?) in identity and lifestyle(lol) and will all probably go to prom and will not skip it under any circumstance because they've been looking forward to it since the beginning of secondary school. I feel like such a freak for not being able to put this stupid dysphoria behind me to enjoy myself. At least I'll save money if I do skip."

To summarize, reports came out that private banks have lowered capital and have began to lower the amount of LC's. This is objectively true. But then Pinaki turned this into the narrative that 20 or so private banks are FAILING because they are using increasing amounts of credit to give out LC's. \n\nThe reality is nowhere near as bad as he makes it out to be, but I know this because I understand how the banking system works. But for people like you, or other regular people who have no idea about many technical aspects of the world, you'd take Pinaki's selectively chosen tokens of information as the reality and form your belief system around it.\n\nI'm not saying the left is any better, BAL does the exact same thing. The government's reports of foreign reserves, GDP, etc. have for the longest time been misleading, and independent organizations like the World Bank and IMF have started to call BAL out on this. Which is why you should not view ANY political commentator or politically influenced source in Bangladesh as reliable, that includes people like pinaki, elias, as well as ministers and the government.",

Sheikh Hasina not only has the backing of most if not all of the aristocrats and elites in Bangladesh (such as politicians, businessmen, intellectuals, media influencers, etc.), but Sheikh Hasina has somehow managed to get the backing of every fucking international political bloc on Earth with the exception of maybe Pakistan. \n\nThe obvious one that comes to mind is ofc India and Modi government, but Most of Europe, East Asia, China, and even the US supports Sheikh Hasina and BAL. I think Bangladesh is the only thing that has been able to somehow bring Russia, USA, and China together. As a result, I don't see how Sheikh Hasina could possibly get toppled at this point without a literal \"freedom war\" of sorts with freedom militant groups rebelling. And even then, I highly doubt India will let that happen.\n\nAnother thought that comes to mind is that, SHOULD Sheikh Hasina be toppled?? Trust me, I am not any less of a critic of BAL than you are, and I a 100% agree that BAL should not be in power from an ideal standpoint. However, the political landscape in Bangladesh is so dog shit that I don't see how any existing political party could possibly run Bangladesh better than BAL. Bangladesh is literally one step away from turning into an Islamist Theocracy, and that one step is a fair election. I definitely trust the \"normal\" and \"predictable\" corruption and atrocities of BAL over a potential Jamaat e islam dictatorship over Bangladesh (which seems SCARILY likely). \n\nSo AT THIS MOMENT, I don't think we CAN, nor we SHOULD topple Sheikh Hasina's rule until some things change. I'd personally prefer a completely new political party with new and young strong educated leaders who had no connections to politics prior whatsoever. But until then, I'm afraid that Sheikh Hasina is the best we've got.",

Sure it could be argued that my mom is not a perfect muslim since she is married to my dad, but isn't that most if not everyone?

Most \"new wealth\" people live in Dhaka since it's the economic hub of Bangladesh, and there is a common trend between new money and liberalization. On top of that, Dhaka is arguably the only place in Bangladesh with liberal hotspots such as English medium schools (schools that follow the British/IB curriculum and often exercise western norms and culture such as prom) and heavily progressive private universities such as NSU, IUB, etc.\n\nAnother reason is that the Bangladeshis who go to North America for university are very often from wealthy families since North American Universities are VERY expensive and scholarships are quite scarce, especially in Canada. As I have mentioned before, there is a sociological trend with improvement of standard of living (wealth) and liberalization. This is why Bangladeshi university students in North America are so liberal. This point also applies to Australia, where Australia is so expensive that most Bangladeshi University students in Australia are from the top 0.1% in Bangladesh and are often quite liberal. For whatever reason Bangladeshi's don't move to the UK that often for University, even the wealthy ones who can afford it. This could be because if one could afford the high cost of university in the UK, then they can just attend university somewhere else that has more friendly policies for immigrants such as Canada, Australia, USA, etc.\n\nFor some personal experience, I myself live in Dhaka and attend an English Medium school and I plan on moving to the US for university. More than half of all of my classmates are planning on doing the same, and they are all overwhelmingly liberal.",

College acceptances are often very highly correlated, meaning if you get into Harvard, you're VERY likely to get into 17-18 out of the 20 colleges u apply to, whereas if you're simply an incompetent applicant, you will not get into any of them cuz simply put... YOUR CREDENTIALS are VERYYY highly correlated with your ability to get in.   \nThus, the 64.15% probability works in a totally luck/lottery based system where the probabilities are completely independent, however, the probabilities in real life are very highly correlated with other factors, so those other factors such as school grades, ECA's, etc. are a better determiner of your university acceptances than whatever additional marginal luck shot gunning provides.",

We\u2019ve got the numbers on this subreddit but we need to get familiar with one another and get together.\n\nWe\u2019re very close to having a mesh of people in both Florida and California, meaning that for those joining up in those states, you\u2019ll have a good chance of having others near who you can meet up with! As time goes on, more and more nuclei of activity will form, and these will help us form capable chapters. More people make the next wave of people easier to organize, and the easiest thing is if everyone joined\u2014then, you\u2019d have instant groups everywhere. Right now, I\u2019m specifically looking for all those that want to network in Florida and California. (If you\u2019re not in either of those states, still check things out! We could use more people networked in New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, and in Canadian provinces in the near term as well.)\n\nAside from getting networked with us, another thing that people do is getting involved with your communities. You can either help out with a cause or even simply socialize at parties. Organization has a social basis. Getting to know who you can count on is antifascist work. The next step after that is giving each other things to do to work towards a goal.\n\nWe could use help with flyer drives as a show of force. Flyer drives involve picking a date on which to post flyers across the country. They are a good starter assignment for coordinating action, posting persuasive arguments, and inviting people to the website/subreddit/Discord/etc. Various flyers are available in the Resources sidebar on this subreddit.\n\nA fourth thing you can really help out with is social media. Social media is time intensive, and it\u2019s been difficult to split time between organizing and social media. If you do try this out, try sharing an account among multiple people to reduce one another\u2019s workload and consistently engage with followers. Fewer better managed social media accounts will be more effective than many individually managed ones that may fizzle out. Please direct people towards those organizing and organizational resources. Social media is also great in that concerned individuals will submit useful information. If you make a social media account, let us know so that we can add it to the website.\n\nCheck out our website:\n\n[https://www.ironfrontusa.org/](https://www.ironfrontusa.org/)\n\nDiscord invite:\n\n[https://discord.gg/6wuDznYe](https://discord.gg/6wuDznYe)"

                "body": "&#x200B;\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem to solve with organizing and that is getting everybody into one time and place. I hope to relate to the people here some of the struggles we\u2019ve had with organizing and making sure you understand the simple solution to the problem.\n\nI want to set up national organization, to get new chapters up everywhere to deal with fascist threats and encroachment. I knew this was a monumental task to undertake, but I was encouraged by the tailwind that I saw here in our numbers. I wanted to get everyone involved with organizing resistance. But, things aren\u2019t so simple, as people need other people to remain engaged enough to accomplish their goals. Without people stepping up, things slow down. Frustration can drive people away.\n\nSo, why are things so difficult? Whereas there are some centers of activity, the majority of the people working with us are spread out. We\u2019re also not just in the US but looking to help organize those in Canada, Australia, and Europe. Some place are growing, but others are stifled. We probably need a hundred more people to just reach a point of self-sustainment for every major location in the US where we wouldn\u2019t have to trudge through the months to just exist.\n\nWhat it\u2019s going to take to get people and get organized is: 1) Get lots of people from this subreddit. I\u2019ve been posting on this subreddit weekly to try to encourage people to join our public Discord, network, and discuss in real-time what\u2019s to be done. This subreddit is great for posting news and events but seems difficult for connecting with people on a personal level. The subreddit has a lot of temporarily active posts where you may not even have a long enough conversation with someone to remember their username. We\u2019re instead building friendships on the Discord. 2) Get people to put work into lots of social media accounts. Social media is time-intensive. Social media accounts get pertinent info from their followers but the people running the accounts are spending all their time interacting with their viewership and trying to get people to join. They don\u2019t have time to build infrastructure to put the submitted info to good use, they need more people. Whereas we may be able to get people started on social media (and this is something that will be vital to build up later on), people want to instead be doing the things that are direct, in-person, and important. 3) Get people through on-the-ground organizing. People can connect through protests or with other orgs. But, starting on your lonesome with organizing in your area is daunting, to say the least. It\u2019s not easy or quick to get to know someone over six months and then pop the question of antifascist involvement. Yet, any one of these ways can work and we try all of them.\n\nThis post is an appeal. I can\u2019t activate people, there\u2019s nothing convincing that I can say that\u2019ll drive home that, yeah, you can do this, but you can\u2019t do it alone. Get networked, get organized. I\u2019m still learning about all the myriad things that people wish to accomplish with the American Iron Front. But, if you want something to get something done, I\u2019ll try to help you get it done. If you want to protect others and enact change or simply make friends in your area, please consider joining our public Discord. Even just a hello and getting to know your neighbor makes all the difference.\n\nWe\u2019ve got the numbers to make things happen. There are thousands and thousands on here and on other antifascist subreddits. But, we\u2019re spread out and not efficiently communicating. To get organized, it takes work, but it\u2019s also just simply getting people into one time and place. We have a space for people to talk and exchange their objectives and their know-how. I know new people want to know where to get started, and we have some infrastructure in place. For each new wave of people joining, it gets easier for the next wave and the next to get out there and make ourselves heard. The easiest thing would be if everybody on here joined, and then you\u2019d have an instant organization. If we can incorporate the thousands of people on this subreddit, we will have new chapters nationwide spring up overnight, and you can get shit done with your fellows. Please help protect others in your community.\n\nDiscord invite: https://discord.gg/dy82ZcUu"

                "body": "I\u2019m trying to prompt the use of synchronicity as an organizational tool. A synchronous conversation is where people are chatting live in real-time, whereas an asynchronous conversation is where people are sending messages back and forth intermittently with no two people being present at the same time. Synchronicity, I believe, is key towards engaging people and bringing them together for organizing.\n\nIt\u2019s simple to have synchronicity in person since meeting someone irl implies you all have allotted time to speak with one another. Synchronicity can also happen online, but depending on the design of the online platform, communication may tend towards becoming synchronous or asynchronous. Discord is more synchronous since each server is condensed, has permanent channels for chatting, and gives you pop-up notifications when people @ you. Meanwhile, Reddit is more asynchronous due to having far too much space, managing thousands of different interests/distractions, and having quick posts where people are only temporarily active. Some subreddits have live chatting features but Reddit isn't secure. Asynchronous sites like Reddit are alright for getting a message out to lots of people but are bad for making personal connections, difficult for having conversations of three or more people, and slow for assembling teams. People feel isolated. Despite having the world at your fingertips, you don\u2019t have people. It might be better to initially chat with people on Reddit and then see if you convince them to continue chatting with you on a Discord or more preferably on an encrypted messenger.\n\nIf you are looking to organize specifically online, try to have synchronous conversations so that people remain engaged and get to know you as a person. Synchronicity is important, but the main underlying problem that people are fighting against is entropy\u2014people being diluted by having too many spaces and online niches to fill up. The internet is infinitely expanding, so you need tools that reverse dilution and instead bring people together. Synchronicity doesn\u2019t solve the whole problem but it is a step in a more organized direction.\n\nAs a side note, we are looking for help organizing if you\u2019d like to join our public-facing Discord: https://discord.gg/3GztgHKG"

I experience some mild stomach pain too.   \nI doubt it's the food I eat cause despite planning to try keto I haven't made changes to my diet itself yet.   \nSomeone knows why is it like that and if there's something I'm doing incorrectly maybe?

Brainstorming sessions are especially anxiety inducing - when I need to think quickly I just freeze and my mind goes blank.\n\nI learned how to draw by redrawing pictures of my favorite anime and video games characters over and over again. When I was writing stories for pleasure, I was basically copying the narrative of the books I enjoyed at a time. \n\nOriginal ideas, what's that?\n\nI'm good at copying things, looking at references and translating them in a simple, practical way into a new context, but imo that's not rly creativity.\n\nHonestly, whenever someone tells me that \"but you know, adhd makes you creative!\" it feels like a punch to the face. \n\nI have all these difficulties with simplest things in life and I'm not even a good, creative brainstormer thanks to that...

I found one that literally just said \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it just know they\u2019re bad.\u201d \n\nNo, truscum beliefs don\u2019t mean you need to medically transition in order to be transgender. That makes no sense at all. We believe that you need DYSPHORIA to be transgender. If you have never experienced gender dysphoria, have no desire to go through hormone therapy or sex reassignment surgery, it\u2019s called being cis. Sorry you\u2019re not special. Being transgender is not a choice.\n\nThat\u2019s the bottom line. We\u2019re not pure concentrated evil. Rumors about us not believing in the validity of non-binary people are not true. We aren\u2019t gate keeping. Every 12 year old you see in the YouTube comment section that offends you is not a truscum every single time."

Secretly I do wish I could talk to her though so one night after a few weeks of this happening I said hey can you stop leaving me at night I miss you a lot and she said she gets sad every night for no reason and that just felt like some bs excuse (turns out the next day she has DIAGNOSED DEPRESSION she hasn\u2019t told me about) so I got mad and to \u201cget back at her\u201d I didn\u2019t talk to her the following morning (basically ghosted her for like 6 hours) and I know it was stupid I regret so fucking much and she thought it was really immature. \n\nShe\u2019s asked her friends for advice and every single one of them told her to break up with me. She said she feels like she should but she isn\u2019t sure. I can still change her mind someone please help me save this I really really like this girl. I\u2019ve said sorry a thousand times I said it will never happen again and she refuses to give me \u2764\ufe0fs back over text and when we FaceTimed she didnt even turn on her camera until after like half an hour of me CRYING ON CALL telling her how sorry I am. \n\nAlso- every Friday we meet after school. We can\u2019t even go to each other\u2019s houses because her mom is terrified of pregnancy but she allows her to stay after school only on Friday\u2019s for a few hours. She has told me several times she doesn\u2019t know if we should meet up. I really want to talk it out in person rather than over call or text."

The thing is not every champion is equal in playerbase depth and they decide to take that into factor. They've talked about the \"Talon effect\" before and why they wouldn't nerf him despite his great winrate because due to the bulk of his playerbase being experienced with him, his general winrate was inflated in relation to others. If Riot only cared about winrate they would nerf him. They pay attention to the curve, but also to where the bulk of the playerbase is, since they want their changes to impact the most people. It's rarely winrate in isolation that's taken into account.\n\nThere may be many factors behind champions like Lee Sin being allowed to be so strong. I remember Riot talking about he being one of the champions with the highest mastery on average so maybe it's due to the fact that even when mastered, his winrate is not impressive on the lower elos and when it comes to the higher elos, the data might not be enough to generate a smooth curve and base decisions around it.\n\nWhen it comes to champions like Master Yi, I believe the bigger culprit is Riot taking lower elos into consideration when doing their balance changes. Same reason Yorick got nerfed some time ago. Yes, it's not smart to balance the game around less skilled players, and it means some champions are just destined to not ever be good for more than one patch, but when you consider that the majority of their playerbase is within this bracket, it makes sense as a business why they don't ignore it, even if it's unhealthy to the state of the game.\n\nI don't think Riven is overpowered, but compared to a champion like Darius, she needs to be in a relatively much stronger position to achieve similar presence metrics. Some champions are just more noticed and present than others.",

Mastery curve by itself says more about how many games it takes for you to figure out a champion than how well they actually perform. There have been notoriously overpowered champions with flat and steep curves alike. How will you balance the plateau in a way that has nothing to do with winrate? What are you trying to achieve with it? How would balance affect the mastery curve?\n\nI completely disagree that the game would be more balanced if they looked at presence and banrate over winrate. Champions like Yasuo and Zed would have to end up in the absolute gutter to achieve common presence and Riven would need to be literally unbeatable to get nerfed. So many champions are just popular or unpopular simply because of design, both of their kits and aesthetics. You could look at growth/decrease over what's normal but even then, outside factors completely adjacent to balance can influence those too.",

No champion would have over 52% or under 48% winrate. Riven, Talon mid and supports like Bard and Janna would have been nerfed a long time ago. Winrate is not extremely inaccurate, it starts off this way but once you aggregate enough data it becomes normalized, that's how statistics work. The thing that most people don't understand is that the number by itself does not tell the whole story and there's many factors that can influence it, like champion mastery, difficulty, strongest build, strength of counters, etc. Riot does take those into account, they've made posts about it before. They brought it up when people criticized them for nerfing Aurelion Sol by saying he had a low pickrate therefore was only played by mains which inflated his winrated. Riot showed statistics that said that the average Aurelion Sol player was not as experienced on him as the playerbase of champions like Riven, Katarina and Lee Sin are for example, and that even players with low experience were succeeding far too much.\n\nSo yeah they do use winrate for balance but not irresponsibly, like I said, there's always some odd choices made in each patch but I don't think their data analysis is bad overall.",

If you sort by all regions, if you go through different patches, check different websites, etc, they agree with this. Only isolated instances like NA Patch 12.8 on [op.gg](https://op.gg) have a discrepancy on this level, and interestingly enough, if you look at the BR region instead on [op.gg](https://op.gg), almost the inverse happens: Grasp is performing much better than First Strike, which I wouldn't call a strong argument for Grasp either.

Oversights may happen, but I think if the data agreed that much with what you're saying they would have given him a smaller buff and commented on how First Strike and the crit build are much better.\n\nI have no idea why you're sorting for the NA region only and only in [op.gg](https://op.gg) when getting the data that says First Strike is performing much better than Grasp. On every site I check, on multiple elos, across all regions, it either performs slightly better or slightly worse in terms of win rate. If it was actually that much better it would be consistent within every region, right now it looks like an anomaly, cherry picked data. If you stay in NA and go back one patch, First Strike is now performing worst and your argument now doesn't have that much of a foundation anymore.",

                "body": "First of all I'd like to say I'm thankful for Riot deciding to listen to the feedback and fix some of the things people criticized the Firelight Ekko skin for, namely adding the SFX and homeguard animations. After many controversial skins which received a lot of feedback that went mostly ignored, most people were skeptical with this one, so it's nice to see that sometimes the community does have a voice.\n\nIt's clear to me, however, that they've willingly decided to ignore one of the most common suggestions for the skins, which was the addition of a mask toggle. They didn't mention it on the post besides a break comment about the homeguard animation, and if they read the other complains, they read the complains about the lack of mask too.\n\nNow, I don't exactly blame them for it. Multiple people have said this already, but toggles can be more trouble than they're worth. Most players seem to be unaware of their existence, and even for the people who know, most just don't bother or forget about using them, so adding it would be pandering to a very small percentage of the playerbase. Extra work for little benefit, I can really see why they'd ignore it.\n\nThat's why I'm proposing an alternative that could satisfy everyone for probably a lesser amount of effort, potentially more revenue for them, and that would be used by more people: Make a special chroma for Firelight Ekko that's just the skin with the mask on. Sell it for the price of a regular chroma, I'd still be willing to pay for it and I'm sure many would as well. The model already exists and is used in his recalling animation, so it's already been rigged as well. Without having to add toggle technology to a champion that doesn't have it, would it really be that much work?\n\nI think many people will relate when I say that, although I really like Arcane Ekko's design, ever since I first saw the first trailer for Arcane I've loved the Firelight Leader's design, before even knowing what the Firelights were or that he was actually Ekko, I had wished that he'd become a champion in the game just so I could play as that design, and the thing I liked the most about him was always his cool owl mask and hoodie. By getting Firelight Ekko, it feels like I'm really close to have my wish come true but won't ever have the opportunity again if they decide to ignore it right now and just release the unmasked version.\n\nTL;DR: Riot is not going to add a mask toggle for the Firelight Ekko skin, that's understandable. Making  it a chroma instead would give fans what they want and allow to make some easy extra money on top of it."

But I'm really torn between taking up nursing and psychology. Since the former was my dream and now I'll finally enter into the field. However, I' m thinking of all the pressure of being a nurse. Mainly, day and night shifts, physical exhaustion, demanding, professors, and I'm not that intelligent\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05. Without will and dreams I'll never choose my strand (STEM) and this course at the first place. While the latter (psychology) is the second course that I  want to take, since it talks about the human mind and behaviors, ngayon lang ako naging aware kasi I really want to take up nursing but I'm having doubts right now.\nMy parents are sort of fine to both but I just want to ask which course po kaya dito sa Pinas ang mas practical kunin sa kanilang dalawa? Coz my family always say \"just choose what you really want\", when I like both of them. I'm just torn even if next year pa naman ako gagraduate, mas gusto ko nang ready. I'm always asking myself naman if I really want to pursue nursing over psychology. I just want to ask for some help. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\n\nThank you very much for reading\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96. Have a great day!!"

Everybody uses all 8 functions, and I bet most people can think of instances in which every one of the functions can relate to them. The best indicator of type, as I see it, is usually what stresses someone out the most, as its usually a dead giveaway of someone\u2019s inferior function and thus the dom/inf axis.\n\nAlthough your type is ultimately decided by you, and feel free to reject this idea, but I still very much believe that you have Ti a dom, just by the way you react to this message. Even in the process of trying to determine your type, I imagine that you had first tried to logic this out in your head and understand the theory first, read up on the types, and see what makes sense in your own head and when you hit a road block, asked for outside opinion. You also seem to be more \u201cattached\u201d to the idea that you have Te, and although you are open to other arguments, the argument must reconcile in your own logical framework before you can accept it. Someone who prefers Te would, in case of this analogy of figuring out type, perhaps wait a bit for other responses, read through all of them with equal consideration, and perhaps one of the responses would get more upvotes than others and they would consider that responses as being most likely correct and the theory outlined to be most robust. Being Ti dom does not mean you are incapable to do the Te, it just means you are more naturally inclined, especially in moments of stress, to default to Ti.\n\nAs someone who prefers Te to Ti, when it comes time to think, I don\u2019t always care too much about the reasons why something is right, as long as it *is* a good solution that solves the problem at hand. Although I would say I have the capability to think deeply, when push comes to shove I prefer to come up with many, although more surface level ideas rather than ruminate to find the one perfect solution. Although I like the idea of being an expert in a field and I try to work toward it to the best of my ability, I would say I\u2019m more of a \u201cjack of all trades\u201d in reality with only surface level understanding of many topics. This doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t ever be an expert/have deep thoughts about something (and I would admit I definitely get a kick if someone says I\u2019m deep or knowledgeable) it just means I\u2019m more naturally inclined to the latter.",

                "body": "Hello, this is just my two cents, and take it with a grain of salt but I\u2019m almost convinced that you are an ISTP. Here is my long winded explanation as to why.\n\nI see that you have a very clear Ti/Fe axis. From your post, you have alluded to, in several instances, that you like to be in your head when you think and form ideas and like to think independently (Ti), but on the other side of the coin, you would need to express your ideas and converse with others (Fe). As someone with Te and Fi, I am able to see this stark contrast as I prefer to gather and form thoughts and ideas with others and like to have as many outside influences as possible to inform my thoughts (Te) but once I have a thought or idea solidified in my head, I do not need to discuss any further as I do not want others to influence the way I feel (Fi) about things.\n\nI also believe that Ti is the more prominent function as this is the one you tend to \u201cdefault\u201d to. You mention that you are in your head a lot (introverted function first) and I\u2019m getting the sense that you prefer to think things through carefully before conversing with others. Someone who is more Fe prominent may prefer to gauge others feelings about things before forming their own thoughts. \n\nTi and Fe are also most likely your dominant and inferior processes respectively. You tend to be very concerned with people, and your life seems to be very informed by the thoughts and motivations of yourself as well as others, which is very common for someone who has a judging function axis as their dominant/inferior. This can be seen in the way you describe your upbringing and your relationship with your parents and sibling, specifically how you challenge your parents religious beliefs and how your family came around to eventually appreciate your thoughts. Furthermore, the fact that you tend to consider your own personal thoughts and reasons above the feelings of others makes it clear that you are Fe inferior. This is illustrated by how you have been called blunt, rude, and narcissistic by others, as well as the fact that you are willing to help others, but only on the condition that they take your advice and accept your ideas since your ideas are most likely the \u201cbest\u201d. The fact that your biggest fear is being alone also points toward inferior Fe\n\nYou have also mentioned that you want to have a impact on things, and place your identity around your place in society. This is a huge giveaway that you have your judging axis (T/F) as your dom/inf. You have ambitions of wanting to make the big decisions of the world, and T and F functions are very much centered around decision making, and the imbalance between your dominant and inferior functions play a crucial role in determining your biggest goals and fears. In contrast a person with a perceiving axis (N/S) in the dom/inf position would most likely have ambitions more centered toward living a life of comfort, reaching a financial status, obtaining certain freedoms, and fears centered around losing financial or personal stability, things and systems falling apart, etc. \n\nAs for the perceiving axis, I believe that you have Se/Ni, although they appear to be very balanced and you can switch between them pretty easily if the task you are doing calls for it. You have said that you tend to look into the future and plan (Ni) yet you can adapt to things quickly if needed (Se). You seem to plan and organize (intuition) in your head, and do, or sense in the environment. In contrast someone with Ne and Si seem would be more likely to use their \u201cintuition\u201d via rapid brainstorming, test iterating, etc and \u201csense\u201d by recalling memories or past experiences.\n\nOf course every one can use all the functions, your MBTI type just based on your preferred judging axis and your preferred perceiving axis.\n\nThis legit took me 30 min to write out, and hopefully it\u2019s not too confusing and I didn\u2019t lose you in the process.

Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am a female in my early 20s living the early career student debt life somewhere in a major US city. Wanna stay as anonymous as possible so I\u2019m not giving away too much!\n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nI have anxiety and ADHD, and feel like I\u2019m more mentally turbulent and impulsive than probably the average person of my type.\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nMy parents and I immigrated to the US when I was a young child and we were in the working class for most of my childhood, and was mostly a \u2018lock and key\u2019 child left to fend for myself as my parents worked. I grew up with a \u2018tiger mom\u2019 and had high expectations to achieve all my life, and it affects me even more so now since my parents managed to break out of the working class cycle and live a rather affluent life now. I believe that my childhood experience had given me somewhat of a complex in which I despise the idea of a fixed authority structure and autonomy is extremely important to me. I also believe that the high expectations imposed on my had some positive effects on my work ethic and pushed me to be a hustler and strive for what I want, but also some adverse affects and had led me to have anxiety, as well as an extreme lack of self confidence and a case of perpetual imposter syndrome.\n\nAs for religion? No I was definitely not raised under a religion, and I don\u2019t quite understand why some people gravitate to the concept of an organized religion. Please enlighten me?\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI\u2019ve spent my last couple of years studying engineering in college and recently got hired to a lab which designs microfluidics for DNA sequencing applications.  I absolutely love my job and my career choice because not only is it lucrative and seems to be on an upward trend, it is also very rewarding as I get to experience being on the forefront of technology and I\u2019m learning new skills as well as being involved in the new research. It can definitely be hard work, and sometimes I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m competent, but I\u2019m overall happy in my field.\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n100% Refreshed! A whole weekend by myself doing whatever I want with nobody on my ass? Sign me up!\n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nSome of my favorite activities include hiking, cooking, and playing video games. I am not particularly athletic in any means and not good at sports in general but I do like to play volleyball.\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI would say that I am more curious than the average person and usually have more ideas than I can execute. I feel like I can develop a curiosity about almost anything- but currently it\u2019s about psychology (hence the MBTI post). I would love to find out ways in which we can reconcile ideas in the \u2018soft sciences\u2019 like psychology with research from the \u2018hard sciences\u2019 ie. chemistry and neuroscience. For example- I\u2019ve been trying to find out if there is research conducted on whether there is connection between f-MRI scans and certain personality traits. \n\nI\u2019ve also been into music for all my life and I would love to read about or conduct a study on how different types of music influence brain activity!\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nDepends on the type of leadership\u2026 I would absolutely love to take on a position that is involved in important decision making, but I absolutely hate bossing around or micromanaging other people. I believe that the best leadership is always a group effort and it should not be only one person calling all the shots.\n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nNormally I am not very coordinated- as in I am a clumsy person who is always tripping over myself and knocking things over, but I think I can train myself to become very coordinated and precise in specific activities through repetition or practice. I would enjoy doing hands-on activity, such as benchtop lab work, or painting my house, but not for extended amounts of time.\n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI do not consider myself to be particularly artistic- I absolutely cannot draw or understand the principles of visual art or graphic design, but I think I do have some musical talent- I played piano for 9 years, and I was in choir for 6 years. Sometimes I like to create my own song mash-ups on the piano because I think it\u2019s fun, but I would not say they\u2019re any good.\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nMost of the time i try to live in the present, but I feel like I\u2019m always either haunted by past traumas and mistakes, or worrying about my future. I worry that I\u2019m not capitalizing the most off of my life in the present, but when I do try to live in the moment I always tend to give into hedonistic tendencies. I think there\u2019s a balance between living in the past, present, and future, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve quite hit that sweet spot yet\u2026\n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI usually would be open to helping them if their request is within my capabilities, or within my mental bandwidth at the moment. Usually when I refuse to help someone, it is because I\u2019m dealing with some shit myself and I\u2019m too physically or mentally drained, or the request is too tall of an order for me and I do not have the qualifications, which I would happily refer them to someone else if I can. I believe that one should always help out others if able, but I also feel like you should never expect help from others.\n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes\u2026 I honestly can\u2019t conceptualize a life without logical consistency. Can someone explain to me what that means?\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nExtremely important. Everything in this world runs on productivity and you can\u2019t expect to gain much from life if you\u2019re not productive. With that being said, I often have trouble being productive and getting into that productive zone :(\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI don\u2019t think I have much control over others, and I don\u2019t like to exert control over others. The  only thing I can be certain I can control is myself and my own circumstances.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nMy hobbies include singing, playing the piano, scrolling through Reddit\u2026 anything that allows me to temporarily shut my brain off, stop and smell the roses? :) \n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI am definitely an active learner- the environments I learn best in include round table discussions, hands on laboratory settings, or group project settings. I prefer classes that involve a mix of logic and creativity.\n\nI also have a terrible memory and tend to forget terminology and details as soon as I learn them, but I am more likely to retain general principles and  concepts. I tend to think of my brain as a logic processor rather than a storage drive.\n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI\u2019m not a great strategist, but I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m terrible either\u2026 I usually break down projects to more manageable chunks so I would have a starting point, but I prefer to do then consult (either project manager or other group members) then revise-  do, consult, revise, repeat.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nProfessionally- I would like to eventually become an expert in a field, and eventually land a keystone scientist/engineer role in a company. \n\nPersonally- I would like to become a more well- rounded individual. Have more friends so I won\u2019t die sad and alone, and hopefully learn to enjoy life more? I\u2019m not sure what that entails yet but I just hope to achieve true happiness.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI guess my biggest fear is losing everything I\u2019ve worked on/built in my life to unlucky, unforeseen circumstances\u2026  \n\nI also have a few physical and emotional triggers due to my anxiety that I choose to not elaborate on that incite uncontrollable fear in me, and if I get a handle on this my life would be exponentially better.\n\nI hate being in environments in which I feel as if I am being controlled or manipulated, and in environments in which I feel like I have to conform. Basically cults.\n\nI guess all my fears are rooted in the lack of personal control\u2026\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nI usually experience a high right after a major achievement. Like after a job promotion or completing a thesis, buying a car, getting married, etc. Usually looks like the period of peacetime after you win a war\u2026\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nLows in my life is usually the wartime prior to the highs, such as the struggle and grind of completing a thesis and the imposter syndrome that comes with it. The interviewing stage before getting the new job when you are constantly let down by waves of rejection calls or emails. And the turmoil of finding the right partner to spend the rest of your life with and getting hurt by countless people in the process.\n\nI believe life follows a sinuso\u00efdal relationship, just an endless cycle of highs and lows :)\n\n\u2022\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI prefer to not be attached to reality and live in my internal space but alas, life is not just a simulation. I have a condition called maladaptive daydreaming and I have very long and vivid daydreams in which I am totally oblivious to things that happen in the real world, and even when I am working or doing things to serve the physical world, I tend to go into my headspace since that\u2019s where most of the productivity happens.\n\n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI could think about anything if you give me enough time in that space. Anything from trying to conceptualize string theory or quantum gravity to daydreaming about being a rockstar or a hero in an action flick to having imaginary debates with Hitler to imaginary therapy sessions with an ex. Just whatever pops into my mind at the moment.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nDepends on the urgency. I\u2019d I have time, I tend to take my time to weigh options, but If I feel like I\u2019m spending too long on something and can\u2019t decide, I just flip a coin.\n\nI tend to always second guess my decisions, no matter how fleshed out my thought process was, but once I made it I guess there\u2019s no going back.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nWay longer than I would like to. I tend to dwell too much on my emotions to the point where it can cloud my thinking and negatively influence my decisions. Emotions are a very important part of my life, as I\u2019m unable to escape them no matter how much I try, so I guess I just gotta do better about managing them :/ Therapy definitely helps.\n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nSometimes, depending on situation. If an important decision needs to be made, or if it\u2019s about something important to me, then I would definitely be more argumentative, but if we are just conversing for the sake of small talk, or if the argument is about something minor, than I would agree just to avoid the hassle.\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don\u2019t like to be directly defiant or blatantly break rules, but I do like to bend rules and push boundaries. I do find some thrill in seeing how many rules I can bend without being noticed. However I think some rules are stupid or outdated and those rules I\u2019m likely to disregard."

He is luckier than you.\" -Jesse Pinkman, \"Rabid Dog\"\n\nOkay, dog with me on this one. This theory posits that a game of chance for Walter White had effects on Greendale Community College, but it makes more sense to start with a quick recap of Breaking Bad.\n\nIn Breaking Bad, the main character Walter White, wjo lives in Albuquerque is diagnosed with lung cancer shortly after his fiftieth birthday, and he goes on a ridealong with his brother-in-law, DEA agent Hank Schrader to a meth lab bust, where Walter sees his former student Jesse Pinkman, a small-time meth cook. Walter and Jesse make a 99.1% pure meth, and that meth gets noticed by Hank. Walter and Jesse get tangled with the dangerous Salamanca family, who are a Mexican drug cartel, and Walter and Jesse manage to escape. They contact criminal lawyer Saul Goodman, who knows someone who can find Walter and Jesse a new boss. That new boss turns out to be Gustavo Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), owner of the chicken restaurant Los Pollos Hermanos.\n\nGustavo Fring is careful and unassuming, making sure everything is in place for him to control before taking any action. He has a secret underground superlab for cooking meth, which he employs Walter and Jesse to do for him. He and his right-hand man Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a former cop from Pennsylvania, struggle to keep Walter and Jesse in line and decide the cooks must be killed to protect Gustavo's drug empire. Gustavo has one primary goal, and that goal is to drive the Salamanca family, his bosses, into the ground as revenge for killing Gus's partner Max a long time ago and gaining total freedom from them. Walter and Jesse manage to kill Gus and save themselves, using the last surviving Salamanca as bait.\n\nOn the home front, Walter tries to keep his criminal activities from his family. His wife Skyler eventually pries the truth from him, and she's strongarmed into helping him cover his tracks or risk the family falling apart, all because she now knows the secret. They decide Walter's drug-earned fortune should have the cover of Walter being a successful gambling addict. After a two practice rounds of counting cards, both of which Walter loses, Walter decides it's best to not play cards to show Hank and his wife Marie that Walter is a recovering gambling addict rather than an active one.\n\nAfter Gus dies, Walter and Jesse rope Mike into the remains of the operation. Mike deviates from Walter's plans and wants out, deeming Walter too careless and volatile. Walter kills Mike in panic and continues the operation, covering Mike's former leads to Gus buy hiring a gang led by Jack Welker.\n\nJesse gets fed up with Walter's cruelty too many times and goes to burn Walter's house down. He's intercepted by Hank, who recently learned that Walter is the famous cook he was chasing for a year at that point. Hank and Jesse lure Walter out to the desert, and Walter is arrested shortly before Jack's gang shows up. The gang kills Hank and his partner Steve Gomez in a shootout, and then they kidnap Jesse and steal most of Walter's money. Walter, now officially wanted for his crimes, and Saul go into hiding with the help of another of Saul's connections. After another year, Walter has one last push. He goes back to Albuquerque and gives the rest of his money to his family before saving Jesse. Jack's gang gets killed by Walter, who dies after being hit with some of his ammunition. Jesse escapes before the cops can arrive.\n\nThat was a lot, but it was necessary for the theory. The scene where Walter practices card counting is the point where the Community timeline diverges from Breaking Bad. With Walter's ego, winning either time would likely have persuaded Walter to gamble in front of Hank. Hank would've noticed a discrepancy between Walter's story and his real gambling behaviors, leading to an investigation on Walt personally. This would've led to Hank realizing Walter's double life much sooner, before Gus even gets killed.\n\nThe timeline happens like this: Walter turns fifty in 2008, and he gets caught by Hank less than a year later thanks to the probability of a winning hand at least one time out of two and the subsequent gambling discrepancy. Around the time of the arrest, in 2009, Greendale Community College in Colorado receives Troy Barnes, Shirley Bennett, Annie Edison, Abed Nadir, Britta Perry, and Jeff Winger as first-year students. Gus and Mike go into hiding and choose Greendale for its very lax background checks.\n\nGus takes the name Gilbert Lawson and poses as Cornelius Hawthorne's servant and secret son to take the Hawthorne fortune so he can once again gain a position of power and take down the Salamancas from the shadows, easily fooling the forgetful and elderly Pierce in the process. Mike takes the name Buzz Hickey and uses his police and criminal background to become a criminology professor.\n\nIn the fall season of 2011, Star-Burns tells Professor Kane that they should do a Breaking Bad thing, but two years is enough time for a documentary or miniseries to be made about Walter and Jesse, similar to how we have Tiger King as an outlandish true crime series.\n\nGilbert and Hickey don't appear in any episodes or even in the same season together. Gilbert appears in two episodes, once towards the end of Season 3 and once at the beginning of Season 4, each time only seen by the members of the study group in fairly closed-off scenarios. In \"Digital Estate Planning\", there's even a blatant reference to meth when the White Crystal is mentioned. In the same episode, Gilbert says he wasn't quite himself, and that family can do things to a person. Deflection of Walter White's motives to cover a rare moment of Gus losing his total composure.\n\nHickey was only in Season 5, essentially as Mike himself, who believed in hiding in plain sight, as he explained to Jimmy McGill (Saul Goodman's given name) when Jimmy was still a struggling lawyer, and Jimmy had to find a missing family who ended up simply camping on a mountain near their home. Hickey, in one episode, reveals to Abed a comic called Jim the Duck, about a tie-clad duck who shares a lot of the flamboyance of Jimmy McGill. Maybe Mike even stays at Greendale because Magnitude's catch phrase is \"pop pop\", which is what Mike's granddaughter Kaylee Ehrmantraut calls him.\n\nGilbert seems to be remaining in the shadows and watching, as he did to Pierce in Season 4.  Hickey, on the other hand, likely left Greendale after the Subway and Russell Borchert incident became public knowledge.\n\nIf there any holes in my theory, please poke them, and I hope you have fun reading this."

He\u2019s a Muslim the same way Andrew Tate is a Muslim, just as an excuse to be homophobic, sexist and narcissistic. When I was in the 7th grade I could tolerate dumb behavior because I didn\u2019t know any better and didn\u2019t care as much, but now it\u2019s made me lose all respect for him. He\u2019s very preachy and acts like he always knows what\u2019s best for you while also disrespecting his my boundaries, minorities and even his own religion. \n\nWe used to hang out and just talk all the time. We\u2019d smoke hookah, occasionally drink but mostly we just talked. He\u2019s actually a pretty smart guy in some areas but he\u2019s horribly mislead. And I\u2019ve gotten sick of it. \n\nNormally I\u2019d just end a friendship there because he annoys me so much with his hateful ideologies (he has denounced Tate whom he used to like, but he\u2019s still an alpha incel who blames women for all his problems), his sometimes gross actions and overall douchy alpha bro vibe. But we\u2019ve been friends for years and because his insane theories about how the world works doesn\u2019t really impress actual adults who aren\u2019t complete assholes, he doesn\u2019t really have any other friends. And if I \u201cbetray\u201d him he\u2019s left with no one.\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve tried my best to guide him in the right direction which worked to some degree, like him denouncing Tate and actually caring about the working class, but I\u2019m afraid if I\u2019m just his moral compass that has to make sure he\u2019s not going insane, and he doesn\u2019t get any input from any other friends he\u2019ll never really get better. And I\u2019m so tired of constantly helping him.\n\nImagine if you had a narcissistic, needy, liberalist, alpha incel, friend who\u2019s completely blind to his own privilege, makes jokes you\u2019d hear from Joe Rogan in the 90s, makes the most outrageous assumptions about stuff that directly impacts you (like telling me insane conspiracy theories about autism when I\u2019m literally autistic), constantly relies on you to help them and always violates your boundaries. \n\nLast time I tried breaking it off he pulled the guilt card and said he doesn\u2019t have anyone else and actually opened up about some pretty deep stuff. I so I felt bad. And it\u2019s not like we never have fun, I\u2019m just not ever excited to see him and he annoys me so much. \n\nI just can\u2019t figure out what to do. He\u2019s not a bad person. He\u2019s just impossible to be around for me. I\u2019ve grown up around a lot of people of many different minority groups and I care so much about them, their rights and the things they\u2019ve taught me. And when I hear this guy disrespecting racial minorities, the LGBTQ community, women and disabled people I get angry and really annoyed. \n\nAnyway if anyone knows what to do here, please tell me what you think!"

                "body": "So I\u2019ve been long distance friends (around 1.000 km between us) with a girl for 6 months.\nAround august I told her that I liked her and she respectfully turned me down. We were still friends though and we did a great job of talking about it and being honest.\n\nThen, at the end of last month she came with a bombshell out of nowhere and said that she liked me too! As many of you would understand this was like a dream come true. She\u2019s the most amazing girl I\u2019ve ever met and we have tons in common while also having lived very different lives, so in my mind, this seemed like if we were in a relationship we\u2019d both enjoy similar things while also learning from each other\u2019s different perspectives. \n\nEverything seemed perfect. Until she told me that she \u201cdon\u2019t know if she wants a relationship\u201d and she instead wants to get to know each other as people rather than potential partners.\n\nFor a month we\u2019ve kind of had a flirty vibe with many deep talks and fun talks about so many things. \n\nHere\u2019s the next problem: I\u2019m almost certain she\u2019s an avoidant attachment type. She\u2019s told me outright that she\u2019s afraid of being vulnerable and is bad at giving emotional support (which I need). \n\nA week ago we texted and she didn\u2019t reply for a day and said \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ll reply tomorrow!\u201d then another day passes and when I was going to sleep I said \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep now so if it\u2019s a bad time, maybe we can talk tomorrow?\u201d and she agreed. Then the next day I texted her to see if she was available\u2026 no response. \n\nThe day after I told her honestly that it\u2019s okay if she\u2019s busy and doesn\u2019t text me or if she doesn\u2019t feel like it, but that I didn\u2019t like it when she promised to text but didn\u2019t because trust is very important to me. She responded by apologizing and explaining that she didn\u2019t know when she\u2019d be available or when she\u2019d be \u201cdown for a chat\u201d\n\nI told her it\u2019s okay if she doesn\u2019t text me all the time as long as she\u2019s honest with me and that I didn\u2019t want to pressure her into making empty promises. \nShe I said \u201cOkay, I appreciate it! Talk to you soon :)\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been three days with no word from her (very unusual) and since Friday I\u2019ve had crazy anxiety about wether or not she still likes me, wether or not she\u2019s met someone else but wants to spare my feelings or if something bad has happened and she\u2019s isolating.\n\nSince she broke that promise (although a small one) twice and that she apologizes so often I can\u2019t help but think that she\u2019d lie or ignore me instead of telling me bad news. \n\nFor now I\u2019m just giving her space until she hopefully reaches out. But I need advice on if anyone thinks this is a bad matchup for me or if I\u2019m just overthinking it? Because I really wanna make it work with her! But I also don\u2019t wanna commit to someone I can\u2019t fully trust right now. I\u2019m a little hurt and very anxious with every day she doesn\u2019t text because it\u2019s not normal for her to not text at all for multiple days.\n\n\nEDIT: I talked to my sister and she helped me with my emotions a lot. Basically, I\u2019ve decided that I want to be in control of this situation, by making a choice. Do I not try to pursue her and keep looking or do I take the risk, endure some anxiety and try to address her needs in the best way, to hopefully make it work?\n\nThen I looked at what I really want. I felt like I should leave her because I didn\u2019t know if I could. Now that I know that I can, it\u2019s become clear to me that what I really want is her and that I\u2019m willing to take the risk. It might not work out, in fact that\u2019s very likely, but I\u2019m taking this shot at happiness because I believe her to be worth it. We\u2019ll see though."

Definitely use Beatrix here because her follow-up ignores defense. \n\nI don't exactly remember the fight but here are things I remember about it:\n\n* I used Seymour's FR when enemy hit the threshold (40%?) and used Enhance Guard. No need to use it earlier as the boss is just naturally tanky. Otherwise, Seymour offers really low damage for the most part because he lacks brave gains so I use him more as a debuffer/aura counter. Save his LD debuff for lower health.\n* I think my FR usage goes: Beatrix (down to \\~75% hp) + I used Yuna's BT+ on the highest FR % I could time > charge with friend summon > Yuna FR to Yuna BT phase, hopefully you get to 40% threshold or at least close > Seymour FR once enemy uses Enhance Guard > Seymour FR to finish the boss off\n* Yuna FR usage: It gets a strong bonus from transformed HP/BRV attacks so use them during her FR. It also gets 93% from using Esuna/Cheer. You'd want 7 turns left of FR before going to BT phase so I'd use HP+ attacks from allies and Cheer/Esuna with Yuna to get to 7 turns left. Go to BT phase and spam Energy Ray (NOT EX or LD. use her HP+ attack so you get high bonus). I usually get to \\~800% on last hit with BT finisher.\n* I don't have Seymour's BT+ so that would def make it easier if you have it\n* I had 5/5 Greatsword for Beatrix and 0/5 Staff on Yuna. Beatrix is 0/3 HA+.\n* The boss KOs your party if he breaks you with his ALL attack (Almagest). So if you see the boss queueing ALL attack, the party member before boss turn should you ONLY use BRV attack (Sonic Wings for Yuna) to keep their BRV high. As for Beatrix, as long as the enemy has Rose Petals, her follow-up would battery the party so you're safe from being broken when using any attacks.\n* Always make sure your buffs and debuffs are on. Yuna's buffs are all very important for this fight so make sure they're on and that party has no debuffs because her buffs would lose effects. For LDCA's, I think I stacked HP dmg taken debuffs for Yuna BT phase\n* Use your lvl 50 summon at highest FR % to push damage\n\nGood luck!",

A lot of that tribal was literally Drea making it clear that she's not saying that at all.\n\nThe question Jeff asked was \"do you think it's race-related?\" to which Drea answered \"I think it's just subconsciously a little bit of that, unfortunately.\" - people are taking this exchange out of its context, exaggerating and mistaking that this is about Chanelle and Rocksroy's vote-offs.\n\nIt's important to discern that, while looking at the jury is what made Drea recognize the situation, her issue is specifically with this recurring pattern that happens in Survivor, and not with the vote-offs of Chanelle and Rocksroy. As she said later, for her it's about representation and she doesn't want their representation this season to be about this same cycle. She was looking at it purely from a statistical point of view. -  this is the context to Jeff's question which Drea answered to.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is, the exact question she answered to was \"do you think it's race-related?\" not \"do you think it's because of race?\". For such sensitive topics like this, we have to make these distinctions clear.\n\n**There is a difference between Drea having an opinion that unconscious bias is a small factor contributing to these statistics vs. saying that unconscious biases** ***are the reasons*** ***for these specific vote-offs***. - which is not what Drea was saying and she made this clear many times.   \n**One is an observation on statistics and the other is an accusation to the other players.**\n\nI hope this helps with making Drea's point clear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditional observations from the episode:\n\nAnother thing she mentioned later on in the discussion was about minorities going out early in the game. While the pattern of black players getting voted out in a row is not a thing that's overly prevalent or blatantly done in the game, I can also understand how her feelings of \"these things always happens\" could be affected by all the other noticeable statistics regarding the vote-offs of minorities in Survivor, and maybe even on other shows too."

I'm rooting for Erika and I'd prefer for her to not sit next to Deshawn. If Ben and Adam can win with such messy games then I can definitely see him still win.\n\nHe was an active player the whole game. Controlled Luvu pre-merge (ran circles around Erika) and remained as a big player post-merge. He's the only one left to take credit for the influence the black alliance/D&D had in the game.\n\nHe also have the most strong, personal bonds with the jury out of the remaining ones, and could potentially deliver the most emotional speech at FTC.\n\nHe can put a positive spin to his devious, messy moves/misplays too.\n\n* Spilling Evvie's tea - basically caused the downfall of Yase 3. Enough to ruin Xander and Evvie's relationship preventing him from committing to them and negating any threats Yase posess. This point alone is why I think Xander got very little chance against him since it basically neutered him\n* Betraying Shan - still have an agency with eliminating the biggest player in the game. If he makes it to F3 (without Ricard of course), he'd be the only one left from the majority alliance who can say he survived after making the Shan move, which was necessary for their games.\n* Truth bomb - he still got to stay, thanks to his \"friend\" Erika. He can explain this as part of his social game and having the better relationships than Danny that made him survive this vote\n\nDanny is also now at jury and could potentially smooth things out with jurors who are bitter with Deshawn. His tribal council speech on the Liana boot ep could've also potentially endeared himself to the jurors.\n\nEdit-wise it's suspicious how the show wants us to believe that he has ruined his game, while the rest of the other players gets positive edit going into the finale episode (even Heather didn't get anything negative last ep). The show might be setting up a redemption arc for him at the finale.\n\nNarrative-wise, one thing conflicting his win chances is Erika's foreshadowings, which have been right so far. It hasn't indicated she'd win, but it has been heavily foreshadowed that she'd defeat Deshawn at the end, likely in the firemaking challenge. (unless you count Erika saying \"I'm literally gonna kill you guys\" to Ricard's face as a win sign)\n\nHe basically have no chance against Ricard but against the other players left, I think it's whether his game is strong enough to get votes despite his messiness, like a Tony, Adam, Ben, etc.What do you guys think?"

This would be great to recover from the last fest draining my mythrils (I'm f2p). 2x guaranteed doubles my mythril's value so it should allow me to catch up. I'm still going to pull on RoP/LotR BTW.\n\nThe plan before was to pull hard on this next fest's Rydia/Alphi/Shantotto mage banner since I already got awakenings for all physical elements. But the same relics seems to be appearing on 2x guaranteed banners in the future. If I fail on next fest's mage banner, it would severely hinder my progression as I only have few mage relics, so I really feel like I should wait for the 2x guaranteed banners."

When the previous seasons she would be the one to suggest to ditch a place when things start not looking so good, or just take over a community.\n\nThe thing with The Vultures too and their role of breaking her hopes. Mel's talk with her about how communities would never work and suggesting nomadic lifestyle(like Whisperers).\n\nAlso the thing with Vultures keeping walker herds for some reason, despite having non violent approach. The whole usage of herds just feel so forced, the whole thing with Ennis getting mad so he uses it. Maybe to show Madison the power of herds? Her learning to survive and blend with herds?\n\nTLDR; the whole thing with breaking her hopes of building community and suggested nomadic lifestyle by The Vultures. The whole forced usage of walker herds by Vultures. Other previously mentioned, her having villain tendencies, influence of Nick with being one with the dead. \nAnd of course the recent crossover, and they started teasing about The Whisperers with the herd on the season 8 finale of TWD.\n\nWhat if this is some kind of huge secret, and she was killed off FTWD so she could start filming with TWD for like season 9b :0 lmao Imagine them bringing the whole crossover for The Whisperers arc, with Alicia vs Madison(Alpha)."

These questions will always exist when you are dealing with a club as big as Barcelona. However, I am of the opinion that few heavyweight exits are certain. I define heavyweights as players who came into the team with huge expectations and who have a high wage (I do not take the transfer fee into consideration since that is agreed between clubs and do not represent the player themselves).\n\nOne such exit is Coutinho. It has been obvious that over the past few seasons, his contribution to the team is not as much as we liked, and this season he was plagued with injury problems. Plus, with the amount number of midfielders we have at the moment, and also considering his wages, it is safe to assume that he will exit. \n\nSecond heavyweight exit I expect is Sergi Roberto. He has been a good rotational player for Barcelona over the years. He has also provided the club with the best comeback moment in (arguably) the history of football. Unfortunately, his time is up. His attacking and defensive qualities do not cut it at the highest level of football. So, it is obvious that he will leave.\n\nThe next two exits may seem like bit of stretch but I believe they will happen. That is, Griezmann and Dembele. Let us first take a look at the Barcelona forward squad for next season to see why. Next season we will have Messi (assuming he stays), Fati, Aguero, Depay, Trincao, Collado, Konrad, and Braithwaite, excluding Dembele and Griezmann. Even without Griezmann and Dembele, our forward line is stacked. Aguero and Depay mainly operate in the Center Forward position; Messi too. For wingers, we have Fati, Collado, Konrad and also Messi as he can play Right Winger. I fully expect Messi, Aguero and Fati to be included in the starting 11 for next season for most matches. This leaves no space for Griezmann and Dembele to be starters. Hence, it is in Barcelona's interest to get reduce the wage bill and get some transfer funds by selling Griezmann and Dembele. \n\nI certainly feel bad if these last two exits happened. Griezmann performed quite well this season, his G/A contributions were only second to Messi. Dembele was important in some key moments. But, these changes have to be made to make Barcelona improve and eventually challenge for the champions league."

So then I turned inward, sought out my daydreams where such consequences won\u2019t exist. I didn\u2019t expect it to come this far either. I sort of just created him as an answer to \u2018what would my dream partner be?\u2019. But now we have a story that we share, one that lasts an entire lifetime. But the same scene replays every night, and that\u2019s the scene where we fall in love.\n\nEvery night, I fall in love over and over again. The feelings felt, they are the only things real. So I hold on to them. I feel so much more in these dreams, more than I would in the real world and somehow, it makes me feel alive, like I exist. I have realised I can no longer love the real because I have occupied myself into loving already. So when I land back into reality, I look around and I begin to doubt that I could ever love anything as much as I have loved my dreams. Or even be loved as I imagine to be."

This community has in many ways started to drift from the values that have come to make it what it is, and the mod team as a whole decided to confront these issues. Over the past few weeks, there has been increasing internal friction that came to a head today. We moderators believe we owe it to all of you, the users who make this community what it is, to be as transparent as possible.\n\nAs a whole, the moderators of this sub have determined what we believe to be the values that make this community incredible. This sub is a space for the many individuals who decided they love the stock, and that hasn\u2019t changed -- nor will it. What started as a simple feeling for most of us has now snowballed into something much bigger, precisely because no one is above anyone else - no matter their background, beliefs, or the number of shares they hold...be that 1 or 10,000. The only reason this whole $GME thing has made it so far is the mass of people who have single-mindedly decided to join their fellow strangers and HODL until we reach the moon. Beyond certain rules to keep things positive, this is meant to be a space for all of you to express yourselves, equally.\n\nHowever, some disturbing trends have emerged recently that clash with this idea:\n\n* DD should not be about those who write it, but about the value of the information it contains, and should be judged on that basis alone. Crowd-sourcing information for the good of the entire community here is the main advantage for DD, not elevating certain individuals as those with all the answers. Creating celebrities out of humble smooth-brained apes is **Not The Way**.\n* Moderators acting unilaterally in their decisions and overall approaches instead of as a team also does not reflect this sub\u2019s values, and we moderators deeply regret that users have had to experience any of our behind the scenes bickering in the openness of the sub this past week. A significant number of the recent issues (and the dramatic s\\*\\*t-storms that followed) have been due to a lack of communication, agreement, and teamwork between mods. This sub is not about drama, but about the love of a stock and a positive community formed between the holders of that stock.\n\nDuring the past few weeks, the moderator team has had issues being on the same page when it comes to establishing universal in-house mod principles and operational standards that we all agreed to stick to after reviewing from each mod.\n\nDespite this, there have been several instances of action in the role as moderator that continued to clash with these standards. After recent repeated occurrences of such actions, we as a team determined that for the sake of maintaining the health of the sub, these issues needed to be confronted and addressed. After this discussion, both u/redchessqueen99 and u/rensole volunteered to step down. Both removed themselves from the moderation team, and neither \u2018had their powers taken away\u2019.\n\nThe entire moderation team would like to express how much love we have and how thankful we are for the work these two have done for the sub. We support any of their continued efforts to contribute to the body of holders going into the future, and hope they remain a part of the community to continue their valuable contributions. Just because they are no longer moderators does not mean they are no longer apes!\n\nWe have no desire to publicly shame anyone for their mistakes, nor do any of us want to drag out the drama or cause division and further conflict.\n\nAnd with that being said (and in the interests of transparency), we will be fielding any questions on these matters from you, the users who make this sub so great. We are looking forward to alleviating your concerns as much as we possibly can.\n\nAbove all, this place is still what it was before, and we are intent on it remaining that way. We are a place for discussion amongst those who wish to buy, to HODL, and ride this beautiful rocket to the moon. May we all soon feast in Valhalla. Love you all.\n\n\\-r/GME Moderation Team"

My dumbass looks at the whole, *non-bitten* pill and takes it. Tell my gf, and she instantly begins worrying, saying I shouldn\u2019t have taken so much for my first time on molly. Cue thirty, forty-five minutes I began profusely sweating and my blood felt like it was on fire. I could barely walk and my vision was going in and out. My feet eventually gave out from under me and my gf sat me in between her lap, giving me sips of water periodically. I felt my breaths getting shallower, and I was losing vision and consciousness even faster. I\u2019m not sure if I overdosed, but it sure felt like I was fighting for my life. It felt like my whole body was just shutting down. \n\nSomehow though, I managed to get through that little episode and I felt FUCKING AMAZING after that. Learned my lesson about molly that night and became a lot wiser when using it.\n\naddendum: out of desperation once, my brother scored what he thought was molly and we crushed it up and snorted it off my center console in a Nissan xterra. Turns out we did meth that night, and neither of us slept for three days while also spazzing the fuck out and hearing shit",

The difference is that I saw him 3 times in April (we both live alone and we were careful). This whole month of May he didn\u2019t make any effort to see me OR communicate with me. He literally texted me once a week. When I reached out before he shut me down with his lack of effort in the text convo. The thing is that he was a great communicator just before the pandemic! \n\nMy last straw happened yesterday when I asked to go for a socially distant walk together this upcoming week and he made excuses to not. So I\u2019m giving him 1 more week before sending the break up text (he HATES calling and doesn\u2019t want to meet in person so I have no choice but to text). \n\nGlad I\u2019m not the only one going through this!",

To be clear I mean where the female is the abuser. \n\n1) What are the emotional traumas you have to face during and after the relationship?\n\n2) How do you trust your next partner you get into a relationship with? \n\n3) How did your next partner (after the abusive ex) support you or get you to trust her?\n\n4) Where are you at now emotionally having gone through that experience? \n\n5) Did you ever find a safe space or outlet to talk about your experience? If so, where/ who?\n\nIt would be extra helpful if you have been through this yourself and can specify (to your comfort level) what kind of abuse you faced ex. Physical, Mental, Emotional \n\nIt really matters to me as I\u2019m trying to support my current boyfriend who\u2019s been through toxic relationships in the past."

Then, if you\u2019re still interested, play 2. I also recommend to play its DLC, Minerva\u2019s Den. And then, if you\u2019re still interested, play Infinite and it\u2019s DLC, Burial at Sea.

Were the cracks already there? \n\nSome people think BB15 seemed to have been intended to start a new era, but due to its reception, it doesn't really fit in the BB8 - BB14 era or the BB16 - BB22 era.

Two major perks of online schooling are that I can work at all hours of the day and that I can do all of my work in my bed with my PJs still on and everything. I know that for a lot of people, this would make them less productive, but being comfortable helps me think more about my studies instead of how stiff a chair is or how the fabric of my shirt is too rough. \n\nI use my laptop to do my schoolwork, and I use the same laptop for leisure. I also put on YouTube playlists to fall asleep to. \n\nThroughout the night, I had a strange dream that I was taking a math test that was scheduled for tomorrow. It was very vivid. When I woke up this morning and saw my assignments for today it showed that I already took the test. For math tests, my teacher manually grades them instead of using the programming to automatically grade, so it will be a day or so before I see the grade. This situation has led me to believe that I may have actually woken up and taken the test. It's like sleepwalking but instead of walking around, I took a test.\n\nRecently, I have had some changes in medication that I take before bed, and I've already had a couple instances where things done in dreams were actually reality and vice versa. There's even a previous reddit post from a few days ago that I made about a Mario Kart track that I saw and played in a dream and thought was actually real. I will likely make an appointment with my doctor about this soon. \n\nI have a very good reputation among my teachers, and they have a lot of trust in me, so I really don't want my math teacher to think I'm lying because I can admit that this situation is very outlandish and crazy. I know my teachers probably hear a lot of fantastical and grandiose excuses for things, so I don't want this teacher to think that's what I'm doing. \nI would assume that I did not do a good job on this test, so I would ideally like to retake it or something. I just don't know how to approach this with my teacher."

I once even had a dream about playing it a second time and googling it in that dream because I thought it wasn't real. When I dream, I normally know within the dream that it's not real, so the cave track dreams feeling very real were odd. If anyone is wondering, the track was basically going through a really lush cave with vines and stuff. Thank all of y'all anyway, and I'm so sorry for the confusion."

Only now does the touch make me dread the cold discomfort of cardboard resting upon my abdomen. \n\nAs my hands crossed the fabric, my ears caught the quiet sound of skin against silk. I heard this softness before in my home, but never would I dream of it in eighteen years. \n\nEven as I slowly lifted my hand toward the upper neck region, I could see the white feathered hat; and that same color pink would have stood out among the crowds of people. Still, that hat would not even distract them from the torn up, brown rags that remain of my new abode. \n\nIf I were to get inside this character, it would not even entice my parent\u2019s forgiveness. My parents would have mistaken the fluffy oval below the neck region as a mark of a disgrace instead of my own pride. \n\nYet, for such caution in its design, no man would ever deny the roses that would woo them; and no woman cannot ever lie that the white feather on the hat would reflect her own innocence.

This focused so much on the paranormal bit of the story (as well as character depth). Next thing you know, *poof*. All that was written in that one night vanished. Completely out of sight. I could continue off where I started and later fill in the gaps. That way, I might not have to worry about first rewriting everything back to where it came from. I hope.\n\nIt is overly long too, about more than the limit for a reddit post (which is 40,000 characters). I want to split this up into different parts, but I have a feeling this could be a bit risky. I don't know why, but I always get into the habit with writing too much. This is a thing where I expect a story to go short, but there is so much more to explore that I had to add a few more details in there. This is where I ask a question to you guys.\n\nDo you think I should write a lighter stories first? It would be hard for me since there is a lot on my mind for one story. However, it would turn out as some kind of experiment to understanding where to improve on. I hate writing shorter stories since it narrows information down to either dragged-out information dumping or shorter scenes that could expand much more.

Luck might change my mind, but I prefer writing as a personal hobby that I enjoy. \n\nI thought about starting a short story with some on the r/NoSleep subreddit. Most of these short story ideas I have are somewhat experimental to try out. My only issue is figuring out which of the three short story ideas should I try out. Here is what I was thinking (you can look at the title or read the summaries if you want more information):\n\n**Out of all of my elders that I have interviewed, one stook out to me the most.**\n\n>!Moved by his grandfather's stories in the Vietnam War, Greg decides to interview his elders in care facilities to get stories out of them. In one of his interviews, he encountered an old man who survived a tragedy that no one in this universe would ever encounter.!<\n\n**We found a well in the middle of a park, and it goes on forever.**\n\n>!A team of scientists discovered a well in the middle of an old park. Residents claim that this well goes on forever. Trevor, a geologist and archaeologist, as well as a father of a daughter with a terminal illness, must be faced with a task that could risk his life.!<\n\n**I travel back in time to prevent paradoxes caused by demons.**\n\n>!Josh, a foster kid whose mother died from a car accident, finally gets to meet his father. Once he does, he is set with the task to figure out and prevent his mother's death. What he doesn't realize is that a supernatural force is out to stop him from his task.!<\n\nI want to know what you guys think. I could try all of them, but I do not want to overfill my own plate (if you understand where I am getting at). If my stories capture a few number of people's interests, along with motivation to write, I can start the other short stories and perhaps a series of my own. Advice is always needed, and I not particularly here to ask for help on which one to chose. I just wanted to analyze people's interests and start there."

Whenever he comes over, it *always* turns into a political echo chamber for them. Also, they were not really having a discussion but rather a ranting session about the social environment. It made me pissed off hearing it, and I cannot stop overthinking these things. \n\nIt is also finals, and I am a little stressed about that as well. This could have also contributed to my anxiety attack tonight. I want to get the best grade possible, but I also want to be somewhere else away from my politically biased family. It makes me uncomfortable to sit around and listen to them, even if I plan on not sitting around to listen. Then, when they say one thing, it peaks my curiosity, and then I become stupid enough to listen to it.\n\nAlso, I was not sure about the flair for this. Needed to get it off of my chest, so I guess it is venting. I was not handling it in the healthiest way possible, so this is the best I can do to calm myself down. I also do not want to deceive people when they expected something like \"family/relationship\" or \"work/school.\" I am fine with whatever comments whether advice or questions or support. Just do not tell me advice revolving around leaving my family or whatnot. I cannot control that aspect of my life until I can get my responsibilities settled. I think that happened one time on a different subreddit, and it was the most uncomfortable advice I ever gotten."

At one point, I asked them if they ever have a hard time paying attention to the lectures due to mind wandering. Most of their answers are more physiological such as not getting enough sleep or being hungry. \n\nStrangely, this feels completely different. For me, I always have the feel to do the best in the class, and my focus has always shifted away from the professor's lectures and more towards how am I going to get the grade I need out of the class. For years, I have developed this obsession to get straight A's in school as a means to gain a better learning outcome than I would normally do. These philosophical needs, despite not getting a lot of sleep or not eating enough until after school, do not even exist in my mind. Instead, it is always the big picture and smaller details that get in the way.\n\nI want to know if there is a huge difference between the way students with Generalized Anxiety Disorder feel about their semester compared to students who normally go through college stress. I always felt different from other people because of how different I think and how chaotic my needs become. I am sure the Maslow pyramid would have explained a lot of my situation. Perhaps looking for a weird form of respect or self-image is the reason for such differences and might not be due to anxiety. However, I could be wrong about that. I thought this might be an interesting discussion because I needed to get some things off my chest while engaging on the topic some more."

I\u2019ve mostly been lurking in this subreddit (trying to figure out what all the T4\u2019s and those numbers mean) but I noticed there aren\u2019t many people my age with Graves\u2019 disease.\n\nSo a little background on me: I (F17) have had Graves for almost six years now. Imagine a zitty little middle schooler wondering why her eyes suddenly started to bulge out of their sockets LOL. I\u2019ve been on methimazole and selenium (vitamin?) since I was diagnosed, and my condition always fluctuates from hyper to hypo to normal and back again.\n\nI was just wondering if there was anyone on this subreddit around my age?? Or what to do about my appearance because physically I feel fine, but my eyes make me so insecure. I did research on orbital decompression surgery, where they take the hardened fat from behind your eyes(?). Am I too young to get it? I want to get it the summer before college starts so people don\u2019t wonder about any sudden physical changes."

Cheers!\n\nI did this on Bedrock but I'll flair it as Tutorial anyway.\n\n**Contents:** Because this is disgustingly long.\n\n1. Original Problem\n2. Concept\n3. TLDR Notes\n4. My Solution\n5. Site Control\n6. Main Control\n7. Possible Reapplications\n8. Help Me Lol\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n**Original Problem:**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftCommands/wiki/questions/areas?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nThis was the article for the tutorial similar to the title of this post. My problem was that the `tag @a remove inArea` would spam the chat (if command block output was on) since the players \"in the area\" would always be tagged \"inArea.\"\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n**Concept:**\n\nWe have a spherical or cuboid area with a specific shell thickness. Players entering it will be detected and tagged from the center of the sphere, and specific commands can be executed at them. Players exiting it will be detected and tagged within the shell, and the area-specific commands can be terminated.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n**TLDR Notes:**\n\nI came up with this solution to prevent chat spam mainly.\n\nBasically, the shell detects whether or not you've left an area, since the original article's syntax removes the inArea tag from everyone, at all times, regardless of tick delays.\n\nAlso, for the command block that operates the shell, a thickness is established with the r and rm arguments so that it only detects players in that shell instead of making the process detect everything outside of that area, which then allows you to have multiple areas coexist, as well as isolating each area so it can have independent modifications.\n\nOf course I may have overlooked some things from that article, but I still hope this tutorial is helpful, which is why I'll share a few more ideas at the bottom.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n**My Solution:**\n\nNote that this was done for small spherical areas. In any case, add ticking areas where necessary.\n\nSay we have 2 spherical areas with a radius of 5 blocks/diameter of 11 blocks. Both of these areas have a \"shell\" that is 2 blocks thick. This makes both spheres 15 blocks in diameter.\n\nLet's set up two control points, or places where command blocks will be placed. \"Site Control\" and \"Main Control.\" \n\nWe'll then establish 2 tags. \"inArea\" and \"offArea.\"\n\nBelow are the command blocks. The names of the commands are the \"Hover Note\" of that command block if you prefer.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n**Site Control:** Located at the center of the spherical area/s.\n\nTag inArea\n\n`execute @a[r=5,tag=!inArea] ~ ~ ~ tag @s add inArea`\n\nTranslation: If someone is within 5 blocks of this command block and isn't tagged as in the area, tag them as in the area.\n\nTag offArea\n\n`execute @a[rm=6,r=7,tag=inArea] ~ ~-1 ~ tag @s add offArea`\n\nTranslation: If someone within 5 blocks of the block below this command block, is coming out of the area and is tagged as in the area, enters the outer shell of the area that is 2 blocks thick, tag them as off of the area.\n\n(Note: This obviously won't run for those coming into the area from outside, only for those coming from inside.)\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n**Main Control:** Located in a ticking area.\n\nMode inArea\n\n`gamemode a @a[tag=inArea,m=!adventure]`\n\nTranslation: If someone is in an area, put them on adventure mode.\n\nMode offArea\n\n`gamemode s @a[tag=!inArea,m=!survival]`\n\nTranslation: If someone is not in an area, including the shell of that area, put them back on survival mode.\n\n(Note: Select with !inArea instead of offArea. This activates the effect once both inArea and offArea tags are removed from the player, not while the offArea tag is still present. This is a caution to prevent issues in tick delays I guess.)\n\nUntag inArea\n\n`tag @a[tag=inArea,tag=offArea] remove inArea`\n\nTranslation: If someone is tagged as in the area and is coming out of the area, has entered the shell and has also been tagged as off of the area, untag them from being in the area.\n\nUntag offArea\n\n`tag @a[tag=offArea,tag=!inArea] remove offArea`\n\nTranslation: If someone is not tagged as in the area anymore but is still tagged as off of the area since entering the shell, also untag them from being off of the area. (So that the process can be repeated).\n\nThe untagging process is like a cascade. Once you hit the shell from inside, you get the offArea tag on top of the inArea tag. The inArea untagger command block takes away your inArea tag on the condition that you also have the offArea tag. Now that you're left with the offArea tag, the offArea untagger command block takes away your offArea tag on the condition that you no longer have the inArea tag. \n\nYou end up tagless and ready to enter the area again.\n\nThe process of the area-specific commands like /gamemode and /effect are also intact, since it uses the presence of the inArea tag as its only condition, and the offArea tag is irrelevant in this part of the process. No complicated multiple tags detection measures needed.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n**Possible Reapplications:**\n\nFor cuboid areas, you might have to set up 4-6 command blocks that'll act as a shell, depending on whether or not you're occupying all the Y-levels or just a specified amount.\n\nFor larger spherical areas that might put the Site Control too far away from the shell to detect entry and exit, you might have to put that specific Site Control in a ticking area.\n\nTo make things more exciting, you could make multiple layers that run specific things on players. I usually add the mining fatigue effect and kill monster type entities on my protected areas, but you could play around with more layers if you want. Of course this'll be easier for spherical areas than cuboid ones.\n\nLastly, for gamemakers, the concept of the shell is that it acts as a terminator for a specific command/effect, whereas the area acts as an initiator of it. You could turn the shell into some other mechanic/component for your minigame.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\n**Help Me Lol:** [RESOLVED]\n\nI have two questions.\n\n1. This is my syntax from the Tag inArea command block above.\n\n`execute @a[r=5,tag=!inArea] ~ ~ ~ tag @s add inArea`\n\nAs you can see, I used @s as a selector. Does that only select me who wrote that command or each of the @a[r=5,tag=!inArea] who the command block is executing as? I don't wanna have to write long as hell selectors twice for execute commands.\n\n2. It's similar to the inArea thingy above, but I am trying to select a quadrant of the infinite world or half of it as my \"inArea.\" Any tips on how to do this? For example, starting from the X=0 and the Z=0 of the world, I want players with specific tags to only be able to access the northwest quadrant of the infinite world, and do something (kill/teleport) to those players with specific tags that are detected to have been outside of it."

                "body": "Just kinda venting here, but yeah.\n\nI've (now 18F) avoided a lot of interaction since I moved at the start of high school. I did schooling by correspondence. It wasn't very healthy at the time.\n\nSkip to now, though, I've realised I'm trans, I've worked through my anxiety (but not my dysphoria) with a psychologist, and I'm generally in a much healthier place.\n\nI started HRT about two months ago, after a lot of consultation, and also talking with my family, working through my personal faith journey and all that (proud to say I'm still a Christian, and in a much healthier, more loving way), I started with clothes, about two weeks ago. \n\nI had my supportive cis sister, trans cousin, and cis auntie help me out, even my (also cis) mum, which has been nice. It's been terrifying for me. Anxiety and dysphoria make a sickening concoction. \n\nI saw all these people, and at first I was focused on keeping away and being as invisible as possible. I went through a few stores, got a feel for it, then tried something on. Huddled in a quiet corner, the changing room was beautifully positioned- as if just for me. I gradually got more confident, that was nice. \n\nI was able to wear my new, more femme clothes around, that was nice. \n\nBut then my attention shifted. I saw the people around me, not as beings to avoid and be cautious of, but as other people, going about their lives. That got hard.\n\nYou see, since I shifted to correspondence school (which I have now left, now preparing for work), I never really made much in the way of friends. I felt a bit of a hole left by not going to physical school like the others. My aforementioned trans cousin has those friends, and a network to support her, and that's how she did it. But not having friends in that way- that was hard. Anyway, I digress.\n\nDoing my whole people watching thing, with all the anxiety and dysphoria sitting in the background as I wore femme clothes in public for the first time, I noticed how... grouped they were. And if they weren't, they seemed confident at least. \n\nI knew confidence wouldn't come straight away. I just realised in that moment, how much I wished I had that companionship earlier. How much I wanted a friend, any friend, and if I could have more, a girlfriend or s/o. \n\nIt's hard to reintegrate. All that nervousness bubbles back up whenever I make the trip into the city. Especially when I'm mid-transition.\n\nIt would be unhealthy for me to rely on someone too much though, and it is nice that I can exercise those muscles and show myself I can do this stuff somewhat independently (obviously I still have some family around me, which helps immensely, but still is missing something).\n\nBut yeah, back to the topic, I'm just missing that atm. I'm feeling a bit hopeless about my transition. I know I'm making progress, and I will continue, but there's a constant buzzing in my head that says that I'm not ever going to pass, or even just feel normal in all these normal places. \n\nIt's so hard to be in unfamiliar clothes, and in an unfamiliar social ranking, and to have all this ambiguity about toilets, and not just the raging dysphoria of picking the one that aligns with my cis presentation, but not my trans existence. \n\nI wanted someone there and I wanted them now. I wanted someone to constantly affirm me when the world around me wasn't and internalised transphobia was wreaking havoc on my insides. I wanted someone to hug, someone to be okay with me, someone to be more comfortable with in more situations. \n\nBut I felt like I couldn't get that. I feel it would be unfair, in my early days of transition. I have a lot of growing and learning to do, and I want them to see ME, and see how much I care. And also, probably the biggest deal to my anxious brain, I don't want to put that work in right now. What would I do? I'm not exactly intertwined in community. I live an hour out of this place. I'm not just going to walk up to someone and say \"hey can you help me with my transition?\", or \"hey you're pretty, can we be friends?\". Also, I don't really like working like that. \n\nI'm going to move in a month or so, to a new place. I'm going to be doing a lot more adulting. I plan to find myself more communities. If I can't find an affirming church space, then maybe a queer group. Maybe I can stsrt my own group of Christian queer friends. Yeah, now I'm dreaming. Anyway- With work, and actually some old friends, and all sorts of things there, I should be pretty good there. Obviously it won't be completely peachy, but I'll make it. In the long term I'm confident. \n\nI suppose that's what I keep my eyes on.\n\nI may be in an awkward, in-between, mid-transition phase, I may be lonely right now, I may be a lot of things.\n\nBut I going to get there. I'm getting there. I'll make it.\n\nThanks \ud83d\udc9c"

They accept but don't support my transition further than socially (i.e. clothing, name, and pronouns). But I'd like to think we're in a pretty good place; though it can get emotionally charged on both sides at times, we can still talk about it later. An extra element to that is I have chosen to stick with Christianity, so we have a theological journey to go on too (luckily we don't have much American-style fundamentalism in our circles).\n\nThey're putting a huge and seemingly genuine effort in.\n\nCurrently, my mum seems most concerned about the intersection of trauma with transness and the potentiality that I'm \"rejecting the male parts of me\", especially in my pursuit of medical transition. I'm open to the idea that it may just take time to come around, but I'd rather bring my family along with me on this journey, at least a bit.\n\nI know that I may want surgery some day, but I'm leaving that open. I have recently started HRT and I have felt a trillion times better. \n\nAnyway, I'm struggling to assure Mum that medical transition is a (mentally) healthy option for me.

I know that past 7 days no-water is considered unhabitable, but this is a really slimy asshole of a landlord, so I don\u2019t know how I can get out of this. \n\nWe need to get out, and this absolutely should be considered a violation of landlord laws, but GA apparently has \u201cno specified time frame for repairs.\u201d I don\u2019t know what I can do about this, and how we can leave without me having to pay another 30 days of overpriced rent. \n\nLegal advice very much needed. \n\nThank you"

I\u2019ve encountered a lot of very traumatizing and stressful life situations the past year, so a lack of steady circumstances has often lead me to slide right out of gym time by telling myself it\u2019s pointless, since obstacles will probably stop me just up the road soon. This has led me to stop cold Turkey until my living situation, finances, and general life security are where I want them. \n\nMy mentality against this however, is that these things are ALWAYS going to be happening in life, and that I need to find a way to quit using each hardship as an excuse to quit or even pause. Maybe I\u2019m pushing too hard here, but just because I\u2019m down financially or my car has problems I should be missing my sessions at the gym 3 minutes from where I live. \n\nMy question to you all, is how can one maintain that consistency to the gym even while still working out of inconsistent circumstances?

Cast is all acquired and signed on, budget is 1,800$ total. For everything. Very low budget, but still preferable to meet through campaign funding. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m only newly based in this city (Atlanta), I\u2019m 21, and my network is small. I don\u2019t have any family, and lost most of my friends last year due to leaving a religion. Not to get too personal, but I do hear often that your first film will mostly be funded by who you know. I originally planned to pay for it all myself, but became unemployed two weeks ago right after location acquisition. I had shoot dates at the end of February, obviously I had to postpone that- end of March as of now. \n\nI already scheduled to create a poster this Wednesday with my crew. I could create a trailer as well, create a hook, share the donation pages in a few different places. Or, take more time to just work and get the money up myself. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019m dedicated to this project, but I\u2019m on my own here to figure this part out, and could use some experienced industry perspectives right now. It\u2019s a small budget, working with a small network. If crowdfunding is a viable option for my situation I\u2019ll dive headfirst into it, I just don\u2019t want to waste time on anything that will delay this project further. \n\nAll your insights and opinions toward anything mentioned here are appreciated."

All of them also heavily dissuaded anything that didn't involve self pleasure or basically caving into desire. I was pretty surprised to see zero options outside of \"just touch yourself because it's healthy\". For me and my history, it's best to avoid that slippery slope entirely and go cold, so seeing all this \"just one time\" bs was pretty depressing and discouraging. I dont doubt it's worse for those starting out to fight PMO or just instant gratification in general. \n\nSo why do so many public forums have this tone and opinion? A lot of people I know also have this opinion so I know it's accepted as mainstream for some reason. Is it intentional to keep people in a cycle of hollow gratification and self pleasure? Or are the public gurus just that stupid to not know anything about PMO? \n\nThanks for reading and don't fall into their trap!"

                "body": "But my husband is a businessman - the owner of a store. When he asked me the first few times for help, I figured it was just at the moment, but it became more and more. When I get upset about working at the store it turns into an argument, and nearly all of our arguments now are about the store.\n\nBefore I met my husband (I was living in illinois) I always had my career working freelance in the film industry. I lived a more humble life - small apartments, often living with roommates. I had my one tiny car, and not much else. \n\nTypically how it worked was that I worked for a few months on either one big project, or many small ones. When there wasn\u2019t work, I would just take the time off and enjoy it. It wasn\u2019t typically as long as it is now. My time off was maybe a week here, and then a week there some time later. Sometimes I had a month off, and I would use that time to visit family a few hours away .\n\nSo I met my husband in California where I was staying for treatment after years of alcohol abuse. I never had so much time off in my life - something like a year taking care of my addiction. I spent approximately 3 months in treatment, and 2 years in a sober living house. Additionally, I picked up a job (while I was in sober living) washing dishes at a grocery store, and then a year after I worked at a treatment center for teens. I met my husband while I was still in sober living.\n\nBy the way, that time off made me realize how much I had been working, and how exhausted I was.\n\nAfter two years of dating we got married, and not long after I had to go back to work in Illinois. He stayed in California with the business. I had rented out an apartment in Illinois, and told him I would pay for it. When there wasn\u2019t work, I would come back. It\u2019s been a back and forth thing.\n\nI don\u2019t know how many of you are aware of the film industry\u2019s hours, but they are incredibly exhausting and stressful. The breaks in between my jobs were never a burden. I often made enough money to survive without a problem. They also make my stressful career bearable.\n\nNow, there\u2019s an expectation for me to work there in between my own career. We never discussed this before we married, and I admit this was a huuuuge mistake. Additionally, since getting married we\u2019ve made lavish purchases that I would have never done before. We have a big house and two new cars. As nice as those things are, I don\u2019t feel we need them, and when argue over his business, paying the bills for those fancy things come up.\n\nFor added context: we are a gay couple. We\u2019ve been married since early 2020. We are both \u201cMexican\u201d, but I was born and raised in the US to Mexican parents. He was born and raised in Mexico. He comes from a family of business. His parents made him work at their store when he was a kid. His siblings have businesses. His cousins, and aunts and uncles also have businesses. \n\nI come from a family of teachers, nurses, artists, and psychologists. I can\u2019t think of anyone in my bloodline that has ever owned a business. I\u2019ve never had any interest in business. He wants me to take it over if he gets sick or (god forbid) passes away. It\u2019s not something I would ever want to do, and if I ever did run a business it would have to be something that either helps people, or is related to my interests (for motivation).\n\nI\u2019m hoping this is just two people getting through the kinks of early marriage, but our personalities are so different, and our issue with the business has to be resolved."

I don't invest anything in the people in my life, and I'm always at the mindset of I don't need their help. But now I'm thinking it's not that bad, like to get help from someone, in that way I can see for myself which mindset serves me the most.\n\nSo how does one ask for help anyways? I always feel bad for disturbing someone's time and would always criticize myself for not trying to do it on my own, it's such a dilemma :(\n\nNot only that, I'm noticing that I'm very bad at communicating with people, whether it be in speech or text, I'm very bad. I listen well, that's the only good thing about me being so introverted and passive. This whole lone wolf mindset is making me more introverted, introspective and self-criticizing, so any ideas on how I can be less introverted and more open with the people around me?\n\nAny tips for communicating more, being less introverted, how to take charge when you have a responsibility and how to grab any opportunities that comes in my way?"

But I like to draw; only when I'm drawing I feel liberated. Yet I don't know much about it, not even the basics of art, because of me having not enough passion.\n\nI thought eventually everything will get better and that time will heal my wounds; but time is making me much more insecure and impatient. I yearn for something so deep and intuitive, but I can't seem to find that something/someone that can possibly make me feel passion or can give my life a purpose. \n\nWhenever I see a human trying their best in life, i.e. smiling in tougher times, not giving up on hope and doing consistent effort, expressing about their likes and dislikes vividly and all I grew far and far from believing that I'm the same species as them, the humans. And it's very hard for me to survive or let alone live in a world where I can't find anything which gives me life. It's feels like I'm fundamentally lacking something in my brain and heart which makes someone a human.\n\nAnd I'm worried about the unknown future now. I don't know whether I can live like this for much longer. Either I find my purpose in the two year time I'm giving myself or I die after it, unknowingly, peacefully, without giving any trouble to anyone :)\n\nThanks for reading."

                "body": "I agree that every class has its tradeoffs, however I don't think it's that evenly scaled. The casters might on average have weaker health and ac, but they (especially wizards) often have easier ways to mitigate their problems than the martials do. Too low of strength? Bigby's hand for in combat, levitate if you need to lift heavy things. You could rely on the rogue for stealth... Or you could just cast invisibility and achieve similar results. Lockpicking? Knock. Low charisma? Suggestion, dominate person will do the trick. Why worry about travel speed when you can just teleport?\n\nNow of course no caster is going to have literally every spell at their fingertips at all times, but my point is more that casters often have far more versatility than martials. They also have more potential to get crafty with their attacks because of how their spells clearly outline what they do, whereas getting crafty as a martial leaves the player at the mercy of the dm as to whether or not they're going to have to make a lot more rolls than if they just say \"I hit the dragon with my sword\". From a raw numbers standpoint, martials are fine with how much dps they can bring forth, but might find themselves much more limited in what they can do in combat and especially out of combat compared to the casters. It's not a big deal at lower levels from my experience, but tends to get worse after level 11.",

I've been looking especially into classes that don't have a clear D&D counterpart, and the summoner looked like a lot of fun in concept and to play. I was coming up with backstory ideas, where (tldr) essentially my character ended up gaining an \"imaginary friend\", who was actually a freaky eldritch-esque being; eyes where there shouldn't be, tendrils, the works. Others would bully him throughout his childhood until his \"imaginary friend\" started manifesting itself physically, which helped stop the bullying, but then lead to more of a fear of him.\n\nAnyways, I was a bit hasty, because I later realized aberrations weren't an option for eidolons. What existing eidolon options do y'all think would get me closest to what I'm looking for, re-flavoring or otherwise?"

                "body": "Pardon my rambling but I just gotta scream. Lots of all caps incoming. If you make it to the end, I really appreciate you. I watched the new episode with my Fander friends and this post is a combination of my theories as well as theirs. You know who you are, and you're awesome. :)\n\nThe second I heard the Duke's theme I knew we were in for an epic time, and what a wild ride that was! I didn't see the thumbnail, so the second I figured out it was gonna be featuring my amazing trash king! And I actually have so much to say just on Remus.\n\nFirst of all, the special effects used for Remus's shenanigans were INCREDIBLE. The lighting, the smoke effects, THE FREAKING RUBE GOLDBERG MACHINES!! I'm a big Rube Golberg machine fan so seeing those was extremely entertaining, and so in character for him. Also, I've been saying this to my other Fander friends (y'all know who you are, hi!!) for ***months*** now that Remus is far smarter than he lets on and he really showcased that in the episode. He was also just hilarious in general. His fancy plots were wonderful, but they all kept falling apart in an almost Looney Tunes, Wile E. Coyote fashion (am I dating myself? XD). But anyway, Remus is beautifully smart, and even amid the absurdity of his shenanigans he knew exactly what he was doing and what would bug Logan. He is powerful and he knows it. So many Disney villain vibes. He's like Scar and Beetljuice combined. And I love that for him - he's an *amazing* antagonist. \n\nWhich brings us to amazing, gorgeous, geniusy Logan. He started off the episode so *happy* and I was happy for him... seeing him finally smile genuinely after so long, his enthusiasm at the idea of helping Thomas with this new schedule, was contagious. Even when things started going a bit off the rails ~~on a crazy train~~ Logan took it very well and just carried on best he and Thomas could. He even helped Thomas de-stress when it got too much rather than pushing him more, which was probably hard for him to swallow. He also handled Remus LIKE A BOSS. He knew Remus was there trying to hurt Thomas and he was there heading him off at every turn. He even tossed a few back, even if he didn't realize it. And I'm of course beyond excited that wine mom Logan is CANON. Who can blame him, really lol. If you had to deal with that you'd drink too. \n\nI thought we were just in for a lighthearted Remus vs Logan rematch, but it took a turn in the middle! The orange glowing eyes really made me jump about a MILE (more than I already had by that point, but I digress). Let's face it, we all knew OJ was coming. It's one of the few predictions/theories we've had that have been correct since Virgil being a former dark side. I saw the orange glow in *Logan's* eyes and I just about lost it, because my Fander friends (hi again lovelies) and I have been calling this for ages now, that OJ would go for Logan first. It makes sense. Logan's known to have a temper already, it would be all too easy. And eliminating the literal voice of reason first would make the rest of the way much easier.\n\nAnd this brings me to my personal theory. I think the dark sides have been planning this for a while. Their endgame is to be the sole influencers of Thomas, and to do this they're breaking up the sides and pitting them against each other so they don't trust each other and make it easier for OJ to come in and finish the job.\n\nVirgil was initially in on it but when the light sides accepted and befriended him, he switched sides. The dark sides are not happy about this - Janus even said as much to him at the end of Embarrassing Phases - \"who knows, soon you might be rid of us all\", and Remus also taunted Virgil about his past in DWIT. OJ was nowhere in sight at the time, presumably since it wasn't his time yet. They were still waiting for the right moment, which Virgil's \"betrayal\" delayed for a while.\n\nEnter Janus, still known as Deceit at the time. He was a clear antagonist at that point, but his mission was to pick up where Virgil left off - getting inside the inner circle and become a trusted side, potentially \"light side\" if he could manage it. And what do you know, he did it. Sure, there was some collateral damage in the form of an utterly broken and distrustful Creativity and a Morality who is trying his best but doesn't know what to do anymore without someone holding his hand. But as they say, to make an omelet you gotta break a few eggs. Not only did Janus not care about any collateral damage, but it was also likely planned. Think about it - Bothering Virgil in DWIT was an effort to make him unsure of his place in the group and perhaps bring him back to the dark side or at least make him neutral (which won't work, but good try). And ever since CLBG, Janus has been slowly breaking down Roman while ingratiating himself to Patton, since Patton is the key to him becoming accepted and Roman was the primary obstacle. He succeeded in the latter, Roman's definitely extremely broken and justifiably upset with Patton (his face in the end card omg, we need that Roman arc it's gonna be insane), who is unsure of his ability to guide the sides and Thomas and also of his good relationship with his \"kiddos\". But he's going to try, Patton isn't gonna just give up.\n\n I've been ***extremely*** suspicious of Janus from the beginning. Yes, he's fabulous, but so are Disney villains. And so are people in real life who act like Janus, they can act like very charming people when it's all an elaborate facade. I love his character SO MUCH, but I still think he's not only a snek boi... he's up to something. If the end card is anything to go by (that biblical symbolism was amazing), he's either in on the entire dark side plan or under *very* deep cover.\n\nNow, back to Logan. I think OJ getting Logan is just the beginning because he's not only the most susceptible to what OJ does but the most likely to be the one to be able to take down the dark sides. If they take him down, the light sides have their best line of defense gone. And Roman is already broken and therefore susceptible, so he's probably next once Logan's down.  The only question here is whether we're pivoting to a Logan arc or if we're going back to finish the Roman arc first. \n\nI don't know if Janus planned for Roman and Virgil's tentative alliance that formed in FWSA. Those two together will be a force to be reckoned with, and could potentially be the ones to save everyone. \n\nBut what I think will really happen, my final prediction, is that the dark sides could either partially or completely take over with the last light side standing being Patton. It'll be up to Patton to get everyone to *stay connected* \\- to trust each other again and work together to defeat the dark sides. \n\nIf you read this far - I'm impressed and immensely grateful! You're AWESOME I hope you have a wonderful day!"

Great series, New Horizons was fun, had missed potential tho.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Splatoon >:D i will see where ur super-jumping to, i will go nearby, and i'll SPLAT YA WITH MY ROLLER HAHAHA\n\nhehe playing melee in a shooter game go brrrrr\n\nneed to play more of 3, didn't get to play 1 but 2 was fun.

                "body": " \n\n*Below the Magnolias* \n\n1 - ??? - Good Morning! \n\nIt had been centuries since I had awakened, trapped in an unending sleep. By this time I had no name, form, domain, or power. I was resting beneath a lone magnolia tree, a gift from my last High Priestess in a former life. Alone in a sea of other life, it would've died. But though I couldn't protect it consciously, my subconscious will to stay alive protected it, and in return, it harbored me. Before it had eroded away with time and become naught but a tree and a dirt mound, this was where my last shrine was. \n\nThe part of the forest the tree was in was close to a river and a cabin was nearby. I could faintly hear the sounds of life, blurred in a dreamlike haze. Three little girls were playing. A black-haired one with green eyes shouted to a blonde with blue eyes. \n\n\"Ellie! Tag, you're it!\" She giggled as she touched Ellie, her long black hair getting in her face as she ran. Ellie quickly tagged her. Her hair was tucked in two pigtails. \n\n\"Now you're it again, Samantha!\" Ellie quickly turned and ran. Samantha protested. \n\n\"No tagbacks! Sophiiieee! Ellie tagged me after I tagged her! No tagbacks!\" An adorable brunette with brown eyes and short hair got closer to the others. \n\n\"We never said no tagbacks, Samantha. You know that! You always complain when we do something you don't like, when will you... whoa.\" Sophie had noticed my tree. \"That's a really pretty tree!\" \n\n\"It's like the tree in my backyard!\" Ellie piped in. Samantha looked confused. \n\n\"How is a mag-no-li-a tree way over here?\" Each syllable of the word was carefully enunciated, like she had practiced. Ellie's face lit up! \n\n\"It must have a ghost!\" Not quite. A word of advice: children are often wiser than they appear. They have a unique perspective and colorful imagination. The three girls continued chatting about how they should feed the ghost and went inside the cabin. Their parents just smiled and shared stories with each other and two grandparents.\u00a0 \n\nWhen the girls exited, they had a plate, a drawing, and some colorful wrapped squares. Samantha got the plate, Ellie had made a drawing of what she thought the ghost looked like, and Sophie had the squares. Ellie propped up the drawing against the tree. Samantha set down the plate in front of it. Sophie kneeled before dropping the squares on the plate. The parents were busy with other things. Far enough to fail to notice what happened next, but close enough to be there in case of danger. \n\nSophie said a prayer. \n\n\"Dear Tree Ghost Who Might Not Exist, we've never been really religious but we think there's an afterlife and maybe these Starbursts can help you have the energy to get to where you need to go. We hope you'll be okay. From, Sophia Wells, Samantha Clark, and Elaine Snow.\u201d \n\nThat prayer\u00a0*saved* me. \n\nIt revitalized my being, allowing me to take a form. I was naturally compelled to take the likeness of the drawing. I took the offering. \n\n\u201c*Thank you.\u201d* \n\nThe girls stared in awe. I looked at Sophie as I set foot on the Earth for the first time in ages. \n\n\u201cDid you say the prayer?\u201d \n\n\u201c...Yes.\u201d \n\n\u201cWould you like to be my High Priestess?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat does that mean? Do you have magic? What are you?\u201d \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do much of anything yet. But if you help me, then I\u2019ll help you. If you\u2019re my high priestess, you\u2019ll be in charge of my followers. But I get the final say, okay?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have one anymore. What do you think it should be?\u201d She closed her eyes in intense thought. \n\n\u201cMagnolia. After the tree.\u201d \n\n\u201cThen that\u2019s my name.\u201d I smiled warmly. \n\n\u201cI, Sophia Wells, will be an awesome High Priestess to the goddess Magnolia.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat about us? We helped summon her, too!\u201d Samantha was rather pouty. \n\n\u201cSamantha can help take care of this shrine. And since I imagine this shrine won\u2019t be visited often, Ellie can be a Head Priestess for another shrine.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe only visit Dawn Cabin during the summer. It\u2019s really nice of Samantha\u2019s grandparents to let us, though! I can make the treehouse a shrine or a temple or something.\u201d Ellie had a bouncy energy at the moment. \n\n\u201cI, Samantha Clark, swear to be an awesome Head Priestess of the Dawn Cabin Shrine to the goddess Magnolia!\u201d Dinner was ready, so they\u2019d need to leave. But I had a feeling it wouldn\u2019t be too long before we talked again."

(who is an international Ph.D. student from Iran but currently studying here in the US) about the racist (anti-MENA shit), xenophobic (eg international students are looking for US citizens to marry so that they can get their family (spouse and/or kids) who they have been hiding the whole entire time to get to the US for a better life), and Islamphobic stuff that she and my dad had ranted to me when I asked them if I can go visit him for the holidays, and downplayed those rants as \"concerns about his suitability for me\" (well, jokes on her, he has treated me quite well and helped me grow as a person quite a lot for the whole time we are dating LMAO, especially when this is \\~3 years after I got out of a really toxic relationship with someone who is the closest to her \"ideal\" for me) when she told her \"side\" of the story to the rest of my famiily...and now she demands to meet him despite me repeatedly telling her \"no\" and sticking with it, because I really don't want my S.O. to get into a potentially awkward, uncomfortable, and dangerous situation (I do plan on introducing my S.O. to many in my inner circle eventually, but not to my parents (for at least a very long time) considering their many attempts to sabatoge our relationship (definitely more stories for sure lol))...and even gaslighted me to get things in her own way (especially \"we're your family who you have been born into and raised you since, so we have the right to know him\" like bruh). Thank god that I am closing the distance in less than a week, and I really can't wait (we're currently in LDR mode for now but not for long anymore though the path has been quite difficult I'll admit).!<\n\nWhat I can advise you to do is to first set clear boundaries between you and your mom. If that former option fails, then try the grey rock method/grey rocking (like try to be minimal on details with her as much as possible or make yourself look boring or uninteresting to your mom as much as possible, but be very subtle about it or else she'll definitely take advantage of that, and that will get worse). However, if that latter option fails, then the best that you can do is to not only move out of the house as soon as possible, but move away as far as you can (at least 2-3 hours driving distance away at the very minimum), and set very limited to no contact to her. Nonetheless, just keep at least an arm's distance away from her even if y'all are under the same roof for now. Also, try to talk about the situation to someone who you can trust and who can understand you quite well who is outside your own family (so someone other than your dad) as they can give you great advice on how to deal with the situation. However, the number one thing is to definitely prioritize your own mental health and self well-being and hold your ground as much as possible, because trust me, that gaslighting and manipulation will definitely take a huge toll on your overall health, especially your mental and physical health (and relationships too!).\n\nRemember, you are an adult over the age of 18 (even though your mom may not realize it) and you deserve to be treated and recognized as such. Also, family is not necessarily the set of people you were born in and have been raised in since you were born, but rather a set of people who care for and respect you for who are you individually and want to see you grow, be healthy, and happy on your own terms (can be friends, your neighbors, your sports team, a group of old ladies you meet at a social club weekly, etc.). Don't let what your mom does or says to you get into your head and mess you all up.",

You don't want to be put in a bad mood or negative headspace by them and now you can't show up for the people who deserve your best, or people you want to have that. I'd feel bad if I'm moody with a younger sibling just because someone else pissed me off earlier or something like that.\n\nSo along with figuring out who I should/wish to be loyal to the most, I also have to take a step back and analyze how my relationships impact me. Doing this helped me sort out who I should be most loyal to. Also, loyalty to me is being readily available, dropping whatever I'm doing or making sacrifices to make sure I can support and be there for my loved ones. It's just not feasible nor sustainable to do this for everyone. So yea prioritize for the good of yourself and the people you feel loyal to.",

I do agree with the other comment as well that this would fit a little better as a Clubs game (even though there's already a King of Clubs). Like the Queen of Spades game did have teamwork, but I don't think it was based on that. If you are physically superior, you will win. With your game idea, especially since you need many people to sacrifice their visa days to obtain the cards, I feel like it's more grounded in working together. If you try your hardest, you still need to depend on other people to sacrifice for the overarching goal. And with people dying and how they add to the scoreboard, your fate is heavily tied into the people you play with; just like it did for Osmosis. \n\nI also like your idea a lot because it has the brutality that the other King games had, which I feel the actual King of Clubs lacked. King of Diamonds was a horrid situation, King of Spades was absolutely horrendous, King of Clubs was kinda chill tbh. Also, giving up their visa days makes this seem like it could be the very last game players beat before being able to accept citizenship or not. It's cathartic in that way.\n\nWhat made you pick 351 though? I thought of 365 just because there's 365 days in year. I also thought of 455 because when you add 1 + 2 +3 + etc. up to 13 to represent the King card, you get 91. That number times 4 to represent the suits of the deck, you get 455. So that number would sorta symbolize obtaining every single card in the Borderlands. Though you could subtract 13 in place of the King of Clubs since no one would have beaten it yet.",

I do see one perspective where people believe it's going to become hard-wired rational machines that will inevitably get rid of us because we can't keep up, so I was talking about that.\n\nThough, I do wonder if optimal intelligence actually does include concepts like empathy. Especially since AI at first is going to be made to improve our lifestyle as social creatures. To suit our needs, we desire these things catered to even though logic is at odds with empathy. Surely, in everyday life people make use of both logic and empathy, like it's on a spectrum. This would have to be on the basis that AI develops into a social species. If we create a being that in theory can attain a form of perfection, does it need other AI? For us, at least, other humans cover one another's blindspots. If an AI isn't supposed to have blindspots, would they have a need for the kind of traits that appear in social species, one being empathy?\n\nSo yea just to be clear, I'm not projecting my personal opinions, just building an argument. It could unfold in any way. I just pick a possibility and added onto that narrative. Honestly, they could even take eachother out. Or sacrifice themselves to a motherboard AI to build towards the truly perfect, optimal being. To be clear, I don't personally think that is the perfect and optimal being, I'm just saying they could believe that.",

                "body": "Yea. I remember reading something about how the earliest signs of civilization (or community, can't totally remember) is when scientists found a skeleton that had a healed femur. It basically indicates a group of people would rather nurse the member back to health despite them not being able to contribute anything to the community. This individual wasn't abandoned or discarded. I can see how this can count as a form of efficiency since we are social animals like you said. The short amount of time it would take to nurse the individual compared to rest of the years they would spend contributing to the community, it's a great trade.\n\nI was thinking of more severe examples of mercy. Like a human may see a loved one fall off of their boat into dangerous waters, and they jump in to save them. Next to them, an AI who has the capacity to calculate the risks with unbelievable accuracy and it knows it's very unlikely for it to be able to save the person who has fallen off and survive the waters itself, so it doesn't go. Situations like this is what I'm talking about. It would be nice to take the risk, but it is far from rational. It would be nice for the AI to give humanity a chance to improve itself, but that would be less efficient than just eliminating the issue.\n\nOverall, I guess it does depend on how the AI will actually evolve. Does optimal intelligence actually include traits that are seen in social creatures? Is the optimized world and lifestyle that the AI would attempt to cultivate possible or would they fall into the same cycle as us? \n\nOne more thing I find interesting. Sometimes people say we're the only animals who destroy our home aka habitat, but if there's an imbalance in the food chain that still happens in nature. For example, herbivores can overeat their resources if they are too heavily populated, which means less plants, less of a home for them and other species. Would having a superior race above us, like AI, makes us clean our act up in a way? In the way that many herbivores need predators to keep their population down so they don't overrun their own home, do we need the same?",

These kinds of things pull you away from rationality, so giving us a second chance to be better wouldn\u2019t make sense.\n\nAlso, if this is gradual then possibly it would just remove the most problematic/flawed humans at first. Maybe murderers or the elite figures that have control over the decisions that make humanity looked flawed. You could assume this would be a snowball affect and now you\u2019re getting eliminated because you accidentally littered. \n\nMaybe the scenario that does not delete all of humanity could be due to children; in that children are supposedly born innocent. I\u2019m sure AI could realize this and instead of eliminating us from the face of Earth they come up with the formula to raise the perfect human.",

                "body": "Interesting idea. I think it could be more complex though. There should be more circumstances that makes the game seem more brutal and exciting. Like having to defeat the King of Spades was a very exciting and high pressure situation, same with the high stakes game with the Queen of Spades. If they're just beating the Jack's stamina, it just seems a little bit too simple. Though, I love the noose idea. Watching that would be so crazy if it was a real game in the show.\n\nI think sabotage and violence should be allowed. This really adds pressure because some people could die trying to sabotage someone else. Some players may be so paranoid about the person next to them sabotaging them, so they do it first. Now there are more complexities within the game. Watching this would be more than watching people jog on a treadmill.\n\nWhat if random items are loaded onto the treadmill and people can use those to their advantage? Sometimes weapons, sometimes water bottles for hydration, sometimes random items that could simply be used to sabotage other players like a dodgeball.\n\nConsidering the fact that people would want to target the Jack, since they need to be beaten to win, I think your last idea is very good for that. I can imagine someone receiving a dodgeball and they throw it at the jack. Now because of that, everyone else gets dodgeballs loaded on their lane that they have to jump over and not trip on. Maybe the Jack even has control over what items appear when, particularly before the game begins. He chooses at what point weapons spawn and at what points water spawns. He could even shape this to his physical capabilities so people literally have to be able to keep up with him. Him drinking water would mean everyone else can as well, but can most people even last as long as he can?\n\nExtra idea since the games the citizens come up with somehow relate to their past: Maybe this guy was in a situation where he literally had to keep going or it was death. Maybe he was a war prisoner and ran for miles and if he stopped, he would be captured and die. So the game symbolizes the experience he's gone through. Overall, in his time serving he has developed very high endurance and not many people could match his stamina.",

In the end, no one knows the truth about the Borderlands. They don't remember what happened there, let alone know if it was real or not. Despite lacking this truth, they still fought for their lives and to return to the real world. So I feel like the show was conveying that meaning of life isn't from knowing what it is.\n\nFor example, with Kuina's story, her meaning of life is from her relationships. The support and love her mom always had for her gave her enough meaning to try to make it to the end of the games. She fought for her life in order to return to her mom, the relationship/bond she had in the real world.\n\nWith Chishiya's story, we saw that he seemed to lack meaning in his life because of how powerless he was. He couldn't save the people he felt deserved it and bad things happen out of your control. That's why he referred to himself as \"a man charging death\" because he felt life had no meaning, so he wasn't fighting for his life.\n\nWith other characters, they all have different experiences that correlate with how much meaning they feel life has, or the lack thereof. I think them fighting for their lives in the Borderlands is supposed to directly symbolize them fighting for their lives in real life. Everyone was in critical condition after being affected by the meteor so they were literally fighting to live. So yea, basically I think the show could be conveying that meaning of life comes from what happens during it, not about what happens after or outside of it.",

Whoever hung out with Mira knew she was crazy enough to create these Hearts game and they voted for her to lead those.\n\nShe literally sees how much Arisu values his friends, how much they support him and keep him going. Then decides to show him how much they really care for him\u2026by making them sacrifice their lives for him. She is freaking brutal. Like I get it, the face card games are severe but she\u2019s on another level. \n\nThe Witch Hunt was seriously insane. You have people mass murdering the community they were devoted to and proudly apart of 5 minutes ago. She created the perfect scenario to just incite absolute brutality from the human psyche. LIKE WHAT WAS SHE IN HER PAST? I feel like she worked in Psychology. She played a nurse in a psychiatric hospital in Arisu\u2019s Queen game. Kuzuya was a lawyer and made his game law themed. Mira could have done the same. Maybe just to experience the environment again.\n\nAnd in that game she decides to remove all the support Arisu had and is basically like \u201clet\u2019s see how you deal with utter hopelessness <3\u201d (not a direct quote). And then she\u2019s moved by the strength of his and Usagi\u2019s bond. Like how are you not cold-blooded and completely evil but YOURE PULLING OFF THESE HORRID STUNTS???? Empathy what? Why can you encompass that in your being? How does it fit with the part of your brain that comes up with these nightmares you put people through? She\u2019s a Croquet-Playing Contradiction. A paradox. \n\nAnd just how sincerely proud and joyous she is about her creative, torture scenarios\u2026she is nuts. She was probably a psychologist, or maybe even involved in philosophy, and now she\u2019s glad she can really put these theories to the test, no ethical mumbo jumbo to hold her back.\n\nAnyway, I loved her character and the next citizen leading the Hearts games has BIG heels to fill because she was too good at this. Any thoughts (or information) about her past, her personality or heart games in general?\n\nEdit: Banda and the other guy agreed to stay. I actually think Banda would do Diamonds and the other guy will do Hearts. He didn\u2019t seem like a physical guy, neither teamwork. He also sorta manipulated the girl in the Jack of Hearts.

Additionally, this is an online thing, not an in-person relationship.\n\n**Difference in Romantic Experience + General Comfort:** I've (F20) never legitimately dated anyone. I've had a few bantering/flirting relationships here and there but nothing where I'd have to consider being open or serious with someone. He's (M22) been in relationships before. Essentially, I'm pretty nervous about everything. Anytime he escalates the relationship, I just get so nervous because I like my comfort zone, you know. Like I have my closest friends and I'll talk to them 1-2 times a week and it's fine, it's great. With ENTJ, as soon as we had our first real conversation we just went to talking every other day, 3+ hours. I was reluctant to voice chat, I was reluctant to video call, despite this he's just barreling forward. He'll ask me things like \"What's something I could praise you about that would make you feel the best?\" Things that I'd assume you just passively learn over time. It feels like he's literally trying to speed-run this. Notably, this is happening over the span of a week. Sure, maybe I'm being dramatic. I do value efficiency, but it's not as easy when I have this anxious feeling that keeps coming up every time I'm constantly being stretched from my comfort zone. Today, I tried saying how it feels kinda fast for me and his reaction was basically that he doesn't think he's doing anything severe. So yea I don't plan on saying anything again.\n\n**Problem:** I think it bothers him when I'm reluctant. Also, I can be unresponsive or not reciprocate if I'm caught off guard. A couple of times he's playfully (but truthfully) said that he's hurt because I'm not reciprocating. I do like him and I don't want to mess this up. I just want things to stay the same for at least a little while so I don't keep feeling overwhelmed. So 1.) Am I being dramatic and letting my emotions get the best of me? 2.) Is there a way I can not be so anxious about this whole experience?\n\n**Extra:** This became longer than I thought so I'll sum up the rest. Coming towards the end of our second week and no labels, never actually asked me out. He acts like we're dating. When I asked (after wondering for a long time) what this was and how long he actually thinks we'll be talking, he said he was serious and didn't think I was taking him seriously and that we'll be together 120+ years (jokingly but seriously). Of course I asked again...he reiterated. Overall advice needed: How do I go about this since it's new for me and what do you think about this situation?\n\nDon't get me wrong, he's really attractive to me, witty, smart, super helpful and sweet to me. We get along well, talk a lot, flirt, do things together, the whole 9 it's great. I just can't help but focus on the negatives right now because I want to figure this out quickly since it's really bothering me."

It appears that psychotherapy cannot reverse gender dysphoria any more than it can reverse homosexuality.\n\nThat is partially true, it depends on the type of gender dysphoria. There are many different experiences and causations of GD. In males it does seem to be analogous to sexuality, but rarely the case in females. [https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/gender-dysphoria-is-not-one-thing](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/gender-dysphoria-is-not-one-thing)\n\n>3. Therefore, it seems that the approach that minimises suffering for everyone involved is to accept people with gender dysphoria for what they are, and call them by the pronouns that they prefer.\n\nThe problem is this isn't just a question of language. It is a question of irreversible medical intervention, increasingly in children. There's also the question of single sex facilities (namely shelters, prisons, etc). \n\n>4. This does not mean that gender identity is \"more real\" than biological sex. (Whatever \"more real\" is supposed to mean.)\n\n\"more real\" was poor wording on my part. \"sacrosanct\" would be a more appropriate way to put it. When it comes to the fact that we are allowing males to compete in sports female,  etc. on the basis of a declared internal identity, rather than their biological sex, we are elevating the subjective above the objective. \n\n>5. Nor does it mean that everyone should always be treated exclusively according to their gender identity. Trivial example: A trans man does not need to be screened for prostate cancer.\n\nI of course agree, but that's not how we are seeing this play out (see sports and public facilities).",

Why do you think?\n\n\ud83d\udea8EDIT\ud83d\udea8\n\nI am transgender (female to male). I have gender dysphoria. Which transition greatly reduced.  But I am still biologically female and always will be. And no, my gender dysphoria was not caused by having a \u201cmale brain\u201d. That\u2019s nonsense and what needs be called out as such. \n\nWhat is a new pseudo religion is that brains can be \u201cmismatched\u201d from the reproductive organs of individuals. Or that everyone has a sort of \u201cgendered soul\u201d. Some of who\u2019s are misaligned from our sec at birth. Again, absolute nonsense.

It\u2019s a brand new theory, not based in anything scientific, and yet it has captured most western institutions at this point. And Sam seems incurious about that. How is anyone, let alone renowned philosopher and skeptic, whose willing to take on CRT, not critically examining this issue? \n\nI\u2019d really like Sam to have Helen Joyce, author of \u201cTrans: When Ideology Meets Reality\u201d on Making Sense."

                "body": "Sam Harris seems to adore Douglas Murray, like he's the millennial Hitch. He's not. \n\nI read the Madness of Crowds and thought he had a few good takes, but overall you can hear his distaste for anything threatening to the status quo. A status quo that he obviously benefits from and was born into. I would go so far as to say he detests anything that draws attention to or challenges his privilege. Yes, privilege. I said it, Douglas. \n\nI don't say this because Douglas Murray is the dreaded \"white man\" (hell, I'm one of those), so is Sam Harris, (who, if we're counting, has even another demographic privilege point over Murray), but Sam isn't motivated by maintaining the status quo. He's motivated by a genuine search for equity and well-being for as many as possible - demographic details are irrelevant. Demographic details are very relevant to Douglas. \n\nBacktracking:\n\nI've been a fan of Sam Harris since the \"four horsemen\" video. I was already a big fan of Christopher Hitchens and I really enjoyed his brand of arrogant combativeness. But it's unhelpful under a lot of circumstances, and that's where Sam comes in. Sympathetic, approachable, less likely to be despised by the remaining religious people in my life. But I loved Hitch's unabashed anger, and give-no-fucks-about-your-feelings approach. He wasn't cruel, he just valued truth and justice above not offending people. And that cutting wit! Okay sorry, this isn't a Hitch fan post, there's a point. \n\nSam is obviously a hug fan of Hitch himself, as well as having been a personal friend to him. So when I heard Sam comparing this new guy to Hitch I was really excited.  I read his endorsement of the Madness of Crowds and had to read it. As someone concerned with the 'madness' of identity politics, especially around transgenderism (I'm transsexual and in the thick of a lot of the chaos around what I call the identitarian religion - but that's for a different post) ), and to find that someone with an audience had the nerve to tackle it and write a book about it - and get Sam fucking Harris to praise it - I was stoked! But it didn't take me long into that book to start wondering why Sam sings this guy's praises or, even worse, honors him by comparing him to Hitch. \n\nOn the surface I can kind of see the similarities, but they don't run very deep at all. Douglas Murray is a bigot. I'm not talking about his take on the LGBT stuff - I actually totally agree with him there. However I do believe he is a thinly veiled racist.  His concern is not truth, or justice, or equity, or the well-being of as many people as possible (such as Sam and Hitch). I would wager that he's motivated by the preservation of 'European civilization' and his own vanity. And it's barely concealed. I'm not saying it's racist to be worried about your culture eroding due to globalization and/or immigration, but you can hear the hatred in his voice for those he sees as responsible for eroding it. Granted, I have not read the Strange Death of Europe, but I doubt it would change my mind about his position. It's when he's let loose and ranting that the bigotry starts to crack through... not when he's giving measured concerns on Islamism. \n\nWhen people have brought this up to Sam Harris he defends him and clearly thinks all allegations of bigotry are completely baseless. I think this is American ignorance on the part of Sam. When Murray says things like \"we've tried multiculturalism and it doesn't work\", Sam doesn't actually believe he literally means that. As an American like Sam, we've been living in a 'multicultural' society for generations. Yes there are a lot of issues and racism is a real problem. But we don't give actual credence to the ideas of keeping people separate according to their 'culture'. We've always been the 'melting pot' and can't really imagine things any other way. Europe has not. Immigration of non-Europeans to European countries is a relatively new phenomenon. And Douglas does not like it. He's said so. And then Sam cleans up what he said and makes it sound like it's all born of legitimate security concerns, such as he has himself, and isn't about keeping 'England for the English'. But it is. \n\nIt's like Sam is set on having this compatriot who can conjure up that passion and wit and anger, like Hitch could, that he's blind to the fact that this one happens to be an actual a bigot."

Would he just be chill if you do the same thing? I'm betting mr. low empathy doesn't care how it feels as long as it's not happening to him. You deserve so much better.\n\nYou deserve someone who doesn't go out of their way to try to hurt someone they claim to care about on purpose. \n\nIf you move, he will be your only support and he sounds like he's not doing a very great job of that without it being a high-stakes situation where you're stuck and can't leave. You're so young, there's a world full of wonderful thoughtful people waiting to meet you!\n\nIf you can handle a little sting and sitting with the very human, universal experience of loneliness for a bit, it'll get so much better.

He got angry at me for answering the door. Ever since I've known him, he's felt more like a rescue project than a partner. He has paranoid schizophrenia, and occasionally went through my phone, eventually breaking it because he thought I was recording him while he slammed me into a door. Last week he hit my nose hard enough that it bled after losing his jacket, threatened to kill me if I screamed, and throttled me by the neck, leaving large bruises on my arms and legs as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I should be happy he's gone, but the house feels so empty now that I'm alone, and all I want to do is go to bed. I lost my job while I was with him, and gained 40 pounds with stretch marks all over my body, so it just feels like my old life is completely obliterated. I was housing him and giving him rides since he seemed down on his luck, and even while being handcuffed, he seemed to blame me for opening the door instead of himself for having a warrant. I shouldn't miss his company, I should want to do things I normally enjoy, like watch funny movies, but all I can think of is how much I wish I had someone to share them with. Any healthy ways to take the edge off of the loneliness? This is all so sudden and I'm just starting to realize that maybe I should consider getting out."

Basically from now until harvest you\u2019re a looky-loo with germs, as far as it\u2019s concerned. If you walk away for a few days you\u2019ll actually have something cool to look at when you return. It\u2019s like your hair. When it grows longer, and you go to visit your mom or your grandma, they\u2019ll make a comments on it. You\u2019ll wonder how they noticed, but you see, they don\u2019t see you every minute of every day, so when things change they notice. Same logic applies to walking away..\n\nGood luck friend!",

I hope you\u2019ll be able to one day use this experience to help others and maybe be able to prevent them from being hot shots and getting themselves into a similar mess. There is a certain responsibility that comes with doing drugs. I hear all too often from people who have never done \u201cx\u201d drug, \u201coh, I have a tolerance to everything and so I\u2019ll need more.\u201d Uhh\u2026okay? If you\u2019ve never done a drug, you can\u2019t possibly have developed a tolerance to it. This is what I refer to as \u201cterminally special\u201d. Books are accurately written about humans for a reason. Physiologically, we are mostly the same, barring severe outliers of course. I don\u2019t know what your motive was for taking so much, but my guess is that it fell somewhere in between the hot-shot-I\u2019m-invincible mindset and the guy-with-high-tolerance-to-every-drug-known-to-man delusional belief. Whatever the case was, I have no doubt you will have taken a very valuable lesson from it. You\u2019re lucky to be alive. This time.

Dutch talked over Molly and Arthur when they tried to voice genuine concern for them. He called Molly delusional and jealous and  in so many word said Arthur wasn't loyal and was selfish. \n\nHow often do you see Dutch show concern for someone else in a way that doesn't relate back to him? When has he done something and expected noting in return? if you say loyalty was all he expected than you're wrong.

More so even with the book \u201cShe who knows\u201d I fail to see how the spirit in the tree is really any better or worse than the crones. Like she kept her word and saved the children, she took vengeance on downwarren then for all we know completely fucks off.     \n \n\nI would honestly be a bit surprised if there where no further consequences to releasing the spirit then her taking it out on downwarren and then just decides to.... just go be a horse for the rest of her days? Yet as far as we know that's all that happens. I would love to see this being a consequence that caries over into W4 if W4 is indeed a direct sequel or anything like that. But as far as W3 let's us know she just murders downwarren and peaces out (unless I missed a big chunk of that story or something.) So with that being said is she any worse that the crones?   \n \n\nShe who knows says that the spirit wanted human sacrifices but so do the crones and the crones are still around, basically enslaving Velen and making people think it's not such a bad thing to feed their kids to them.  The book claims she went mad and made people live in the swamp and get fed on by beasts but like... isn't that just still what Velen is like? She who knows seems like crones propaganda to me to be honest.     \n \n\nThat being said I'm not at all suggesting that the spirit is a benevolent entity, she clearly isn't. But I suspect that she didn't go mad so much as there was internal power struggles between her and her daughters and the daughters decided to off her. The crones we can absolutely say are evil and power hungry. The spirit on the other hand, as far as we know is indeed vengeful but she may be only that. In other words, it's possible she just wanted to be free and after centuries of being trapped inside a tree she's more than a little pissed and willing to take it out on the locals but other than that just wants to be free, and won't fuck with you so long as you don't fuck with her. Which if that is the case, and admittedly we don't know what becomes of her, but if that is the case then I think freeing the spirit could actually be the better way to go. And yes there is a way to do it that doesn't get Anna punished while still saving the children.     \n \n\nOf course it's also entirely possible that Geralt released a crazy horse demon upon the world and the consequences of that will be revealed in a sequel. I dunno. What do you guys think?"

                "body": "GTA never sounded appealing to me or pretty much any of rockstar's other games. I can appreciate that they make good games while not having any interest in actually playing them as most of their story lines seem to revolve around crime and gangs etc. Like cool if you like that, but I always like playing a good guy. When there's a moral choice system I never really bother with being \u201cevil\u201d as, what can I say? I don't like being mean, even in a video game.     \n\n\nRDR2 gets so much praise tho, I feel like it's praised the way games like the Witcher 3 is praised, which I'm a huge fan of. So when I saw RDR2 on sale I figured why not? I'm in about the middle of chapter 3 and I just get so conflicted. I know RDR isn't a role playing game, but I guess I just imagined something like the W3 where the world is very morally grey and you don't always know if you made the right decision or not but you're afforded the opportunity to try and make the best decision.... or you could be a total bastard if you want to, as this is rockstar. Like Geralt could only be so much of an asshole because at the end of the day he had his own moral code and drew the line at being a total thug and bully.   \n \n\nI'm really disappointed that I don't really get to play Arthur that way. I get that there's an \u201chonor\u201d system, but the mechanics of it are dubious at best and as far as I have seen don't really affect the out come or play style of missions you can either just be dick to your gang and people on the street or a decentish dude who lives outside of the law.   \n \n\nI don't need my MC to be Mr.Rodgers but I find it hard, and don't exactly want to sympathize with someone who will just kill others simply because they were in his way. Or if that's really the case then Arthur should just be a bad person. There's so many random encounters and side missions where Arthur will do something out of the kindness of his heart or because he has a sense of justice, even if it's \u201cfrontier justice\u201d he clearly believes in right and wrong only for him to then just snap some poor NPC's neck just because they were in the way of something he wanted to steal. Like Im really disappointed that there doesn't appear to be a non fatal stealth takedown. It just feels REALLY inconsistent.     \n \n\nFor example I just got done completing the no good deed side quest, I'm at like level 5ish honor and Arthur just gets involved because he seemingly doesn't care for bullies and racists...? Which like cool, I'm happy he feels that way, but the doctor wasn't even begging, Arthur was basically like, \u201cdid some hillbillies just ride off into the swamp with a doctors wagon because he was black??? well now, we can't have that! Better go ride off after them and put myself in danger and expect no money or real reward for doing so!\u201d Which to me comes across as someone with a strong sense of justice and is willing to put himself in danger for a good cause. Then the very next mission I do is Horse Flesh for Dinner. And I get to the part where Arthur has the stable hand distracted and you are prompted to stealth kill him. And I'm just like wtf really??? I can't just knock him out??   \n\n\nI follow the prompt but then my game got kinda glitchy so I decided to just quit the game since I'm kinda bugged by the whole inconsistency of the story missions. Like I intend to keep playing, but ngl it really bothered me. Like narratively \u2013 wtf??? I can be alright with Arthur and the gang fucking over both families, their both rich, racist, violent asshole's but the stable hand is the stable hand! He just mucks up their horse's shit. He's just minding his own business trying to do his job probably way more poor then the gang is. And it's not even like they had to kill him so as not to be discovered. The fucking guard saw them on the way in. I dunno I didn't finish the mission, maybe they take out that guard too.... which would at least be more morally consistent, but that still seems like a flimsy reason to have no option to just simply knock him out or something. As Arthur has been showing his face to fucking everybody in town....   \n \n\nI mean I'm not looking to have the story spoiled, but it's already been spoiled to me that Dutch is the bad guy and he's gonna fuck up his scheme in rhodes. I mean even if I didn't know that Dutch is the bad guy, it's pretty clear he's manipulative and doesn't know wtf he's actually doing. Maybe there's some big pay off that will make the moral inconsistency make sense. Sometimes it seems like Arthur realizes that Dutch is an idiot and he kind of does bad things and has no real excuse for why he does them. But like c'mon man you're like 40. I get this is all you know, but like by now it seems like you should be fully committed to being a bastard or should have started questioning your lifestyle a long time ago.     \n\n\nHosea seems like he's basically a con artist, and isn't opposed to shooting someone so long as they shoot at him first or otherwise give him a pretty good reason to. If the game remained more along the lines of the Hosea missions I could see how Arthur could go about his life and be like, yeah I'm crook but I'm not a BAD guy. The stuff Dutch and some of the others make him do... I just don't see how that wouldn't have you questioning you're morality a long time ago and it just really pulls me out of the game. I want to like Arthur and I want to sympathize with him, but many of the missions kind mess that up for me.     \n \n\nI dunno, I'm not looking for spoilers I'm just frustrated with the inconsistency. Is there something I'm missing? Does the story make it make sense in the end? Or am I just not supposed to put too much thought into the missions in the grander scheme of the story and they basically exist as excuses to have hordes of gunmen to shoot at? I dunno, am I the only one bothered by that?"

Usually id take month breaks from mods & my tolerance would go right back down. So im confused? \n\nAlso, does anyone know any good ways to potentiate modafinil? Like other drugs/vitamins, anything? Im used to taking speed to be productive, but quit as it was making me an emotionless robot... a productive one though. Im hopinh to find something / a combo that makes me just as productive? Any ideas?\n\nthanks guys"

It's rare to see an anime game to be so committed to presenting real life culture that they refuse to do things differently even if the audience might not be used to it.

At best, they are treated as merely love interests or closed ones to the male character, or used as a plot device/pedestal for the character's growth. In lots of instances they're portrayed as strange alien creatures incomprehensible to men, their thoughts and feelings are akin to black magic or quantum physics.\n\nThe point is, women here never feel like they are humans. There is always a clear separation between us, the men and the humans, and them, the women, for some reason. And usually the women group is a step below the men group. To me, it speaks volume about how removed from reality some of these writers are. They can't write human beings without categorizing them into groups full of stereotypes, and never even attempt to understand the people that they're writing.\n\nMaybe it's because I read too many classic books. Books that are written in the past and are just products of their time. In any case, I'd like some new suggestions of modern or classical books where women are as much human as men, who have their own lives, goals, and growth outside of surrounding our male character.

While I also am interested in normative questions and probably wouldn't mind that much about cultural science and science of literature, I am not sure if this masters degree tackles questions that are different than I hope when I read about texts of classical philosophy of science from the 20th century.  \nI tried contacting the study office but received no answer."

This are his first works I have read aside from \u201eMeaning and Reference\u201c. \n\nUnfortunately, after his death, he couldn\u2018t expand on what the relation between reference and truth exactly is and why reference excludes some kind of correspondence theory of truth to the referred external thing. If you happen to understand why he does this or if you would recommend me articles on this, I would be very grateful. Additionally, if you would recommend me discussions on Putnam\u2018s interpretation of Alfred Tarski and if he is warranted in thinking that Tarski\u2018s definition of truth doesn\u2018t imply a correspondence theory of truth, I would be very grateful as well.\n\nBecause of Putnam\u2018s semantic externalism and my previous research on Russell\u2018s theory of description, I became interested on the philosophy of perception. His mind externalism as an objection to sense data theories of perception and that apperception that are conceptualized give us physical properties blew my mind. Are there any works of Putnam that expand on these components? Hilary Putnam seems to cite Tyler Burge\u2018s \u201eOrigin of Objectivity\u201c as a mind externalist account of perception. Would you recommend me reading it for this purpose? Are there any other texts you would recommend about this and Putnam\u2018s account of apperceptions?\n\nTo summarize: What are the literatures and discussions about his theory of truth he gets from interpreting Alfred Tarski? Why does he think that reference being an essential component of truth is incompatible with a correspondence theory of truth, if he does? Any literature on this and discussion on why we should think of them as incompatible? What literature and discussions would you recommend on his theory of perception from his semantic and mind externalism and his account of apperception?"

Her skin's getting drier now, so that's her biggest issue. I need product recommendations but ingredient suggestions are also welcome. However since she's just starting out, I'd like to keep it simple for her. I'm thinking that once she gets used to retinols, I'd slowly introduce her to AHAs and BHAs."

                "body": "I noticed there has been a lot of questions regarding simple stuff in the game, and these questions have been causing a lot of fluff because they flood the sub with posts for questions that are answered every single day. With that in mind, I decided to make a FAQ post so it can be referenced whenever this comes up again.  \n  \nIf your question is not quoted here, feel free to ask it in the comments, I will be updating this post whenever something relevant comes up like a new feature or such.  \n  \nAnd with that, here's the list of a few FAQs that I gathered.  \n  \n\n# Q: What does this icon mean?\n  \n>A: If you see an icon and have no idea what it means, hold H in your keyboard, it will show up the name of the effect, as well as a short description for it. For console players, hold the map button.  \n>You can also find a list of status effects with more detailed info [here](https://ark.wiki.gg/wiki/Status_Effects)  \n\n# Q: Is this enough food for this particular tame?\n  \n>A: There is no way of us knowing if it will be enough because a lot of factors may affect the amount of food needed for each creature. A rule of thumb is always bringing more than what you think may be enough. If you really need an exact answer, though, use the dododex app and configure your rates in there.  \n\n# Q: What creature should I bring for this boss?\n  \n>A: It depends on what difficulty you're playing and which difficulty you plan on summoning. It also depends on whether you're playing SP, official or unofficial servers.  \n>For Gamma bosses, you want to get a couple of max level creatures and breed to get their strongest HP and DMG in a single creature and also level it up as much as possible. You also want to get some decent saddles and a Yuty leveled on Stamina.  \n>For Beta bosses, you'll have to do a better stacking and possibly some muts into damage and HP. Saddles need to be better as well. Don't forget the Yuty, he will be a changing factor in your boss battles.  \n>For Alpha bosses, you will have to do a decent work on stacking damage and HP mutations, as well as ascendant saddles. You also may want to consider leveling some HP in your Yuty and also bringing a good armor since some bosses can attack the rider.  \n>Remember that if you die, your creatures die as well, so do not unride your creatures unless it is actually necessary.  \n>I did not talk about each boss' weakness, but you can find it in [this](https://ark.wiki.gg/wiki/Bosses).  \n\n# Q: How do I tame a Quetz  \n  \n>A: If you have access to griffins, use them. You can yield guns while flying and this will make your life much easier.  \n>Other methods that may work are:  \n>  \n>*Tapejara + Tribemate* - the Tapejara has a passenger seat and you can yield weapons on it. Obviously you will need someone to shoot the Quetz while you drive it.  \n>  \n>*Argie + hook* - If you have no friends and no griffin, what you'll have to do is get near the Quetz with your Argie, unride it, shoot a grapple on it, then whistle attack on the Quetz. This will make it follow the Quetz and you can shoot it. Remember to whistle passive before it attacks the Quetz so you do not kill it accidentally.\n\n# Q: Where can I find this particular resource?\n  \n>A: [here's](https://ark.fandom.com/wiki/Resource_Map_(The_Island)) a resource map so you can find it yourself. There is also a lot of videos on YouTube for finding resources easily, so you might want to take a look\n\n# Q: How do I turn on the generator?\n  \n>A: You need gasoline. Put oil and hide in your forge and it will create it.\n\n# Q: Why is my mut missing?\n  \n>A: There are a few cursed moments when your status mutation lands on movement speed, and since no creature can have more than its base speed, it nullifies the mutation gains.  \n>Something similar may happen with the color, which is the mut landing on an inexistent color region for that creature since even though not all creatures show all 6 regions visually, all of them have the 6 regions, so your color may have landed on this unlucky spot.  \n>  \n>A more consistent way of telling if your creature is mutated is having both parents with the same stats, which will make any non mutated baby have the parents' level. If it has 2 or more levels than the parents, then it is a mut.\n\n# Q: My game keeps crashing\n  \n>A: It is most likely some mod you have installed. If you do not have any mods or you're certain it is not a mod you're using, then try validating your files.  \n\n# Q: How do I get rid of Alpha creatures?\n  \n>A: Alpha creatures cannot harvest corpses, so just wait until it's attacking some dead corpse and then shoot it down.\n\n#Q: How to have level 180 creatures?\n  \n>A: Go to your GameUserSettings.ini and put this under [ServerSettings]: `OverrideOfficialDifficulty=6.0`  \n\n# Lastly, questions regarding release dates are not exactly certain because:  \n>A): There has been no official confirmation of it  \n>B): It's Wildcard, expect a few delays lol"

I thought she was asking about beard growth and begun to say I had not experienced anything other than my usual moustache. She stopped me and said 'No, I mean like your penis.' which was totally out of left-field. It led to me asking if she'd ask me such a question had I been Cis, she replied maybe during the initial puberty, but that she'd see it happening anyway and not need to ask; whilst this is different because I'm an adult and thus keep my privacy. \n\nI declined to answer and just laughed it off as some time-gone-by boomer social interaction I don't understand. I'm just happy they're even acknowledging I'm Trans, but I can't help but feel it was a bit weird.\n\nWhat are other's thoughts on this?"

I thought I'd make a whole timeline post about going private; I noticed when looking around Reddit I could never find posts that had a lot of depth and/or response times from medical professionals. As an Autistic person, uncertainty around structure caused me lots of distress, so I thought I'd make my own now that I've managed to get on HRT!\n\n**NOTE:** I had to chase up a lot of hiccups during this process so it may be longer than typical. Never feel bad for being assertive in your healthcare. Also all my assessments were done via video consultation (minus bloods and the shot itself, of course) and paid for by pocket, not insurance.\n\n**TL;DR VERSION:**\n\n**TOTAL time from first email to my first T-Shot: 1 month 24 days (8th July-31st August)**\n\n* From first email to initial assessment: 20 days (8th July-28th July)\n* From initial assessment to gender dysphoria report: 12 days (28th July-9th August)\n\n**TOTAL time for all initial assessment completion: 1 month 1 day (8th July-9th August)**\n\n* From emailing endo to endo appointment: 22 days (18th July-9th August)\n* 29th July i had my bloods done for the endocrinologist\n* From endo appointment to being prescribed Testosterone: 14 days (9th August-23rd August)\n\n**TOTAL time for all endocrinology completion: 1 month 5 days (18th July-23rd August)**\n\n* 26th August I picked up my Testosterone in person\n* From being prescribed Testosterone to first shot: 8 days (23rd August-31st August)\n\n**Total Cost: \u00a3709.50**\n\n* Initial Assessment: \u00a3500\n* Endocrinologist Consultation: \u00a3200\n* Testosterone Prescription: \u00a39.50\n* Extra stepcount in my daily walk from travelling to the doctors only to be told something was wrong: About 30,000 steps.\n\n**LONG VERSION:**\n\n# Initial Assessment\n\n* **Provider:** [The Gender Clinic (Ran by Dr Popelyuk)](https://thegenderclinic.co.uk/)\n* **Assessor:** [Dr Hejda-Forde](https://thegenderclinic.co.uk/#doctors)  \n* **Cost:** \u00a3500 (This cost was processed on the 11th July following a phone call from the practice, it is taken in full.)\n* Response time to intial request: 5 minutes (No, seriously)\n* Initial assessment date: 28th July 2022\n* Gender Dysphoria report provided: 9th August 2022\n\n**Pre-Assessment Procedure:**\n\nI emailed The Gender Clinic on July 8th at 15:48 enquiring about an initial assessment to get my gender dysphoria diagnosed so I could proceed with HRT. Surprisingly, the clinic responded 5 minutes later, at 15:55, detailing the clinic costs (\u00a3500 Initial, \u00a3350 for any follow-up sessions, which seem to be relevant mainly to those with Learning Disabilities or mental health conditions such as Schizophrenia or any Cluster B conditions. When I enquired about my own Autism, I was informed I wouldn't need a follow up).\n\nAlso included in the email were the first available appointments and their times, which I booked by responding to the email accordingly and leaving them my mobile number.  I responded on the 11th as I had to check my work availability before committing, they responded 2 minutes after mine to tell me a colleague would be following up via the phone. A colleague from the practice called me about an hour later and we discussed my expectations for the appointment; reaffirming the time i'd booked; and how I was going to pay. The appointment was paid in full (\u00a3500) via the telephone call so have your card on you! I was then sent a confirmation email with a link to the video consultation. \n\nFurthermore, on the phone I was asked about an endocrinologist as that's who the Gender Dysphoria report will be sent to. I said I'd looked around but none were good with responding, and so asked her who she recommended. She recommended someone named Dr. Robert Moisey, who i ended up going with (I will elaborate on my experience with him in the Endo section). \n\nIn preparation for the assessment, I was sent a questionnaire to fill out. The questionnaire consisted of questions pertaining to early-life events, whether you played with gendered toys, who your dominant friend group was, what made you realise you were transgender, etc. \n\n**Please note the questionnaire does ask about past sexual abuse and self harm.**\n\nAdditionally, the clinic asks you to scan and send photo ID (passport/driving licence etc.) and any deed polls if you have one (I do not and this was not a problem). You are asked to send other medical documentations such as mental health diagnoses, previous assessments and any other relevant information also. **You are also required to have a close friend or relative be available to back you up on any information you detail during the assessment.** \n\n**The Assessment:**\n\nThe assessment lasted about an hour and a half in total. If I could sum up the experience in one word it would be: clinical. Cold and clinical. If you're someone like me who enjoys to talk about serious topics in a funny, jovial and casual manner then you're in bad luck. After asking me how I felt emotionally about the meeting and what my expectations were, I was hit with commentary I found quite distressing;\n\n\"What makes you a male? When others come to see me they're typically dressed very different, short hair, male clothing, etc. But you have long hair, you have earrings which typically men do not wear and I'm struggling to see any maleness in you.\" \n\nI understand that a psychologist's job in this instance is to see if you match a pathological criteria for gender dysphoria, but that was a lot for me. I just have long hair, lots of piercings (not just my ears!) and I was in a Mayhem band tee. I told her plainly i'm a metalhead and I enjoy looking like this and its *me* that makes myself a male, nothing else on my body. If a cis guy was in the same clothing nobody would question his maleness, so why question mine?\n\nShe also didn't seem to understand the overlapping LGBT experience, and why I was talking so much about my formative years identifying as a lesbian; or my emphasis on growing up in a traumatic religious school and that I was too busy surviving to think about gender. It really made me realise how many medical professionals know very little about what LGBT people actually go through and how factors can influence when, if, or how someone comes out/figures their identity out. My history of sexual abuse also came up and I said I felt it irrelevant, she was fine to move on without pressing into the matter which I appreciated. **Please note this section of sexual abuse is written into the gender report itself.**\n\nWe went over the effects of Testosterone and how many effects I knew. I was asked to categorise the effects into 'positive' and 'negative'. Additionally there were discussions of fertility and if i'd looked into gamete freezing. At the end of the assessment I was made to do a cognitive function test which included: Naming animals; drawing a 3D cube; counting backwards in 7s (which was embarassing to struggle with after just mentioning getting my degree.); being asked to draw an analog clock face with a certain time on it; and listening to a list of words before relaying them back to her. She then contacted my relative to go over the assessment and legitimise facts about myself i'd mentioned and to more or less check i'm not a compulsive liar.\n\nThere was no debrief for the emotional conversations you endure during the assessment, be warned. I'd recommend having this assessment on a day where you can then perform self-care directly after, rather than any work or important events.\n\nI was diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria despite my luscious mane and sent my report for review on the 9th August. I then had to check over the details and make sure everything was correct. After corrections were made, the report was sent to my chosen endocrinologist, Dr. Robert Moisey.\n\n# Bloodwork\n\nPrior to the endo consultation I had to have bloodwork done to ensure it was alright for me to go on HRT and to monitor accordingly. This was done at my local GP and I luckily got the time i did due to someone else having a cancellation. There is a shortage of vials for blood at the moment so please check on what appointments you can get because some can have you waiting weeks in advance!\n\nThe bloods required for FTM are:\n\n* Liver Function Test (LFT)\n* Full Blood Count (FBC)\n* Fasting Lipid Profile\n* Fasting Glucose\n* Serum Testosterone\n* Serum Oestradiol\n* Serum Prolactin\n* Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)\n* Luteinising Hormone (LH)\n* SHBG\n* U+E \n\nYou will have to then ask for these results to be printed off (this is done in person as they'll likely have to verify your identity), scanned, and then sent to the endocrinologist's secretary in time for the meeting. I had my blood taken on the 29th July and they were printed on the 8th August. To send these to my endocrinologist I was required to call the hospital he works at and they give you an email to then send it to.\n\n# Endocrinologist Consultation\n\n* **Provider:** [Dr. Robert Moisey](https://www.spirehealthcare.com/consultant-profiles/dr-robert-moisey-c4322810/) \n* **Cost:** \u00a3200 (This cost is still in process, and is not taken immediately, but it is taken in full.)\n* Response time to initial request: 9 days (18th July-27th July)\n* Consultation date: 9th August 2022\n* Testosterone prescription letter provided: 23rd August 2022\n\n**Pre-Consultation:**\n\nI contacted Dr. Moisey through the 'Get in touch' section of Spire Healthcare on the 18th July. I was then called by Spire Healthcare on the 27th July to book an appointment and talk about payment. My consultation was booked for the 9th August via video call. My Gender Dysphoria diagnosis and bloodwork results were sent just before the call. \n\n**Consultation:** \n\nDr. Moisey was very polite and respectful regarding the topic of the consultation. He asked me what I knew about Testosterone and its effects, if i knew the risks associated such as uterine cancer and whether I was aware of the effect on fertility. After that we talked about what kind of Testosterone application I was looking at, whether it be shots or gel. I went for shots and he explained that I could switch at any point between the two and that gel has the same rate of effects as shots do. He explained that the shots are intramuscular and done every 12 weeks and told me he'd then send for a prescription. I mentioned I'd like to do shared care with my GP and gave my details on that and which GP to send it too. I had to contact my GP because my legal name and the name i'd been using for all of this were obviously different. If you contact your practice they can put an alert out that anything in a different name should still go to your legal name's file! \n\n# Getting The Prescription\n\n**Prescription:** Nebido 1000mg Testosterone\n\n**Cost:** \u00a39.50 at the pharmacy till\n\nNow, i've never been on a medication before so I had 0 knowledge of how any of this works. So i'm going to try my best to explain it for others who also have 0 clue how any of this works.\n\nI got a letter in the mail directed to a doctor at my GP from Dr. Moisey saying he recommends I go on Testosterone. The entire letter misgendered me...I have no clue why, that was a blindsight considering Dr. Moisey showed no signs of disbelieving my identity. But i digress. \n\nI rang my GP and asked if the letter was on their system and they said no, its not. But that I could come down and they'd scan it onto the system. So I did that and they said it'd be on the system in the morning, perfect! I ring the next day and ask if its in the system and yes it is, so I can now get Testosterone! Woo! They ask what pharmacist I want to send it to and I ask when I can get it, they say the day after. \n\nI walk down, excited, on the 26th August to collect my T. I then get told the perscription is there, yes, but the Testosterone itself? No, they have to order that in and it'll be there by the afternoon. So I come back the afternoon and get it, Nebido 1000mg. I get home, the excitement dripping off my face AND- No needle, just the vial. What? \n\nIts bank holiday weekend so I have to wait until the 30th to call and ask what's up, which they then tell me I actually have to have a nurse administer it. Nobody tells you this stuff i swear. Finally, on the 31st August i go and get my first shot done, finally.\n\nI hope this has been helpful and i'll answer any questions :)"

However, today I got my written letter, and directly after a sentence saying I am a ftm man accessing HRT, my Endocrinologist proceeds to misgender me the entire letter.

                "body": "Here is my ideal plan for the Sandman show's future seasons. It mostly follows the flow of the Audible releases albeit with a few changes.\n\n**Season 2**: Begin with Midsummer Night's Dream, adapt Season of Mists with Game of You acting as a B Plot. Have Thermidor and 3 Septembers and a January as the special episode. \n\nAlternatively Season of Mists and Game of You can be done separately similar to the structure of S1. Thermidor can used as the breather episode for this season in between SoM and GoY. For this one, Ramadan and 3 Septembers and a January can be the special episode.\n\n\n**Season 3**: Begin with The Song of Orpheus. Adapt Brief Lives + The Kindly Ones 1 to 4/7. The entirety of World's End as the special episode. I think this one would also work better for the show as to get renewed by Netflix at this point as it ends on a cliffhanger that is either >!The Corinthian being recreated by dream on Kindly Ones 4 or The Fates revealing that they can go after Dream as he killed his son on Kindly Ones 7!<. The special episode can focus on Cluracan's Tale, Hob's Leviathan, Cerements, and World's End.\n\n**Season 4**: The rest of The Kindly Ones + The Wake. The last episode will be Sunday Mourning.\n\n**Special**: A three-part special that covers overtures and sprinkles in Heart of a Star to explain >!Dream's feud with Desire and beef with the stars!<. And it ends where the series began.\n\nI also want to include The Hunt somewhere there. Perhaps it could be the breather episode in between TKO and the Wake in Season 4, while Lucienne is cleaning up the mess in her library after TKO, she finds the book that was the plot point for The Hunt. \n\nA lot of this is just wishful thinking though, especially with Netflix's current situation - we'd be lucky to get 3 seasons. What are your thoughts?\n\nEDIT: Removed a erroneous part regarding The Hunt"

The sound had been acting strange since leaving Reliance to go to the previous quest I did, Irregular Customers, but I thought it may have just been my TV at first. Music would be really soft sometimes and normal others, dialogue did the same, I couldn't hear my cyclone except for the boosting and even that was intermittent, my gunshots were generally silent, I either couldn't hear my spiderant or it was quiet, volume in general of some things fluctuated while volume of other things stayed the same, stuff like that. When I arrived at Lumberhold, I looked around and found an ECHO Log. I heard the first line as it appears in the subtitles, before audio cut out on the dialogue. The subtitles stopped too, but I know the log continues past that. There was nothing in-game to interrupt it because I didn't move after picking it up, and I went in the menu to play it back, but still nothing. I know this problem isn't just my TV now. Any ideas to fix it or why this is happening? It's just getting worse.\n\nAfter the ECHO Log, I went in and wasn't attacked, no enemies in sight. I thought it was odd but shrugged it off because although I've played this quest before, it's been awhile and my memory isn't very good. So I figured I remembered wrong and if I kept going, something would come out. But I've gone through the whole place, looting and shutting off the radio tower and even shooting in hopes that may draw something out, and nothing happened. The only things I've fought were the creatures I released from the cages. It was rather boring, and I don't want to continue in case something is wrong with my game/save file. Does anyone know what caused this and how I can fix it? Should I just continue and hope it gets better, despite the loss of loot and XP? This problem is much more important than the sound problem, but I wasn't sure if the issues were potentially connected.\n\nOh, I forgot. The dialogue between Tyreen and Troy outside the Fort was bungled too. The first half didn't happen, but the rest went on as though it did. Not sure if that's connected or important, so I'm saying it just in case.\n\nPlease help me."

When attempting to run the game regardless, it tells me that the plugins are missing too.\n\nI've never had this issue before, certainly not on such a massive scale, and curiously haven't found ANYTHING about it on the Internet (or I haven't dug deep enough), so I want to know if anyone else has experienced this or knows how to fix it, so that I can play with all of my mods again. My only idea so far is to manually reinstall these mods again or trying another mod manager. \n\nThis is most likely a Vortex bug, unrelated to the mods themselves. My version is 1.6.14.\n\nOh and one last thing: shortly before this happened, I got the \"loose files may not be loaded\" warning (see https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/Error_Messages) and let Vortex fix it as suggested. Could that have ruined it all, and is there a way to revert it without reinstalling everything?\n\nThanks in advance!"

I'm currently very busy with other things, so unfortunately I don't have as much time to dedicate to my creative works as I used to. Nonetheless, I still work on my world and regularly add and refine a lot of things, mostly about the world's history, cultures and eldritch, metaphysical stuff as well as a **second planet**, but also the continental layout and, consequently, my world's climate.\n\nAs before, it is still a terrestrial planet, just slightly larger than the Earth, in orbit around a pair of binary Suns (which I'm reworking as well right now, it will stay circumbinary and \"realistic\", but I might change a few things about the Suns as stars like their types and orbital parameters), and the majority of the land area belongs to a massive supercontinent occupying much of the northern hemisphere, with two smaller continental landmasses in the south. This supercontinent, *Aviir*, basically has two halves separated by the *Inner Ocean* or *Middle Ocean*. The long white stretch in the northwest between the black (mountainous) regions is an inland sea in a rift zone where the continent slowly breaks apart.\n\nI figured that on such a landmass, the lands surrounding this ocean would make for the most interesting setting, but I didn't want to throw my already established cultures over board, so I pretty much changed the shape of the landmass to replace the cultures to suiting regions.\n\nToday, I made this quick sketch on a sheet of paper with coloured pens. Please note that, as it is supposed to be an equirectangular projection (a degree has the same size everywhere on the map in all directions), the map does not show the entire surface, but the part that is missing is largely ocean with a few scattered islands, nothing that would change the course of the currents or winds dramatically. It's also just a sketch, I will likely rework and refine the shape of the landmass soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA legend to understand what the hell is going on there, though some colours might be hard to see:\n\n* Arrows are ocean currents: red is warm, blue is cool and purple is neutral\n* Black areas are mountain ranges and highlands, any extended area that's AT LEAST 1000m or more above sea level\n* Dashed black lines are the rough edges of the continental shelves\n* Dark green: Tropical rainforests (i.e. Amazonas)\n* Light green: Savanna.

                "body": "While many Fantasy worlds are merely \"alternative Earths\", or our own Earth in a different, distant timeline, populated by analogues of Earth's flora and fauna, my own circumbinary world Tyrask\u00e4th has its very own native lifeforms that have evolved and adapted to its unique environment over many aeons.\n\nPartially inspired by \"weirder\" Fantasy, such as *Morrowind* (and to a extent the *Elder Scrolls* series in general), as well as Speculative Evolution projects like Biblaridion's *Alien Biospheres* and C.A. Cline's *The Teeming Universe,* I decided to not just use our Earth's animals and place them on a completely different world with no connection to our own, but instead come up with my own creatures filling up the ecological niches of this planet. \n\nMany of those are very similar to life on Earth, mostly because I want to keep some familiarity, and also because luckily, convergent evolution is a thing and doesn't make these parallels too unbelievable. Also, it's mostly Fantasy, albeit with plenty of scientific realism, but still Fantasy, and a few groups of people aside, the setting is largely pseudo-Medieval-ish (my main culture is based on the Byzantine Empire). So, an animal that fulfills the very same role there as, for example, horses do on Earth, will likely resemble a horse greatly, without being a literal horse. I'll still call it a horse though, for convenience and because I'll need to \"translate\" my texts anyway, humans there likely don't speak English after all. \n\nSpeaking of humans: \n\nThey do exist. They aren't literal *Homo Sapiens* and they do NOT come from the Earth, and they have some significant differences from baseline humans (wider range of skin, hair and eye colors, height and weight, generally higher muscle density, slightly longer lifespan, for example), but are largely identical aside from those. It's important to know, however, that humans and their closest humanoid cousins are LIKELY not native to the planet, and were brought there by the *K'Tharaii*, an ancient precursor race sometimes referred to as Elves, from another planet. It's possible that they were created through an unknown process (probably involving thaumaturgy) by blending the genes of themselves with those of a native Tyraskian species, or that humans are a different branch of K'Tharaii. There's no definite answer, and I'd like to keep it vague.\n\nNow, to the native life:\n\nI know how insanely expansive SpecEvo projects can get, and I don't intend to go very deep into the matter yet. It's not a priority, and I currently lack the time (and patience) to do so, so instead I focus on some important extant creatures and their key traits, keep it consistent and sometimes extrapolate it back to find some connections and refine it from there. Now, without further ado...\n\n...let's start with plants:\n\nNot much to say here. It has grasses, trees, ferns and stuff like this that are more or less identical to their analogues on Earth. To be fair, I'm not that interested in looking at the botanical evolution for now, so I mostly stick to Earth-analogue plants with a few key differences. The most notable one is the use of different pigments for photosynthesis: instead of chlorophyll, they use a yellowish-orange pigment, probably xanthophyll (not important to the setting, just wanted to make sure that such a pigment actually exists) leading to most of the world's forest to resemble an everlasting autumn. Some plants, however, are a dark cyan, either seasonally or permanently. The reason for the different pigments likely is the different light output of its Suns: the primary is a K-type, the secondary an M-type dwarf star. \n\nNow, to the animals:\n\nSo far, I only looked at my vertebrates (or rather, paravertebrates). While different from Earth's analogues, they are still somewhat similar to life that once existed here, for familiarity's sake (it doesn't have to be as alien as possible). \n\n* Among the most primitive ones is an aquatic creature resembling lampreys or hagfish: a long, eel-like body, a simple endo-skeleton including a skull, and many fins (8 of those on the creature's side like pectoral and ventral fins that could evolve into limbs). These creatures, at first, had no jaws, much like Agnathae. Some of those later evolved pseudo-mandibles from the two foremost side fins, that moved further forward and became more mobile, aiding them in moving food items closer to their mouths and keeping it in. \n* As their skeletons became more complex, they eventually evolved a primitive jaw-like structure on their skull, which was four-lobed: an upper and a lower jaw, and smaller left and right jaws that evolved from the pseudo-mandibles. In a specific clade, the upper and lower jaws became more dominant, with large bony plates to cut through large food items. These animals also evolved armor-like plates along its body, becoming similar to the Placodermi on Earth. Their fins grew stronger, often with long, thin, feather-like growths around their brims, and on their atrophied pseudo-mandibles, long tendrils grew which aided some species to dig through the sea floor for food, and others to hold pley and move it to its mouth, to quickly kill it with its guillotine-like teeth. Some of these aquatic horrors also grew to titanic sizes, dwarfing even Dunkleosteus here on Earth. On most animals, the mandible-arms just recessed eventually. Also, some of the lamprey-mouthed/proto-jawed creatures seemed to have reached the land as well by now, though they are much rarer and still at least semi-aquatic. \n* One of these fish became the ancestor of many land-living animals. It's important to note here that, among my paravertebrates, there are both six- and four-legged ones. It's possible that they are two completely different lines, descending from a different ancestor and thus, a different landfall event (perhaps different landmasses on archaic Tyrask\u00e4th?), or that one pair of legs recessed, much like the mandibles, as they weren't needed for locomotion. It should be noted that most six-legged paraverts are rather small, and/or found in specific environments, such as mountain ranges where the additional pair of legs aids them in climbing, as well as for semi-aquatic animals. Dragons are exceptions, and deserve an extra entry. Most mid- to large sized animals, including the vast majority of megafauna, are four-legged, and most (but not all) have lost their mandibles too, possessing \"normal\" jaws like Earth's vertebrates.\n* Most of my terrestrial lifeforms that I've looked at so far are based on Synapsids/Therapsids, among the most underrated animals in Earth's history in my opinion (considering they are basically proto-mammals). They are generally warm-blooded and viviparous, but of course there are cold-blooded and/or oviparous animals there too. Many of them also grow fur, or even feather-like coverings. They generally have teeth, and the bony plates of their aquatic ancestors have largely recessed (although they remained in some clades, mostly six-legged ones). Three notable examples of animals are: \n   * Horses, which look a lot like Earth's horses due to the similar ecological niche they fulfill. They have also been domesticated by humans for riding, carrying and pulling, and from afar they look practically identical to our horses. They are, on average, bulkier and stockier, and while they have hooves (or something similar) and fur, they can also have horn-like growths on their heads (no, they are NOT unicorns). The idea for these \"pseudo-horses\" came from a good friend of me who created a steppe-dwelling tribe for my world, known to ride on horned horses.\n   * Spearlynxes are large pseudo-felines, known for both their ferocity and intelligence. They have been semi-domesticated by some tribes, especially of giants (it's less of a domestication and more of a symbiosis). While considered \"big cats\" in my world, and initially intended to be a Smilodon-analogue, they are now more Gorgonopsid-esque with more feline characteristics (very similar gait, dense fur, pointed ears and retractable claws). \n   * Netherfolk, who are loosely based on Suminia. They are sapient, but considered to be primitive, although it's speculated that they have a more advanced (Bronze or Iron Age) culture on a distant archipelago in the far south, although legends of sailors are the only \"proofs\" of this, their credibility questionable. If the K'Tharaii actually created humans through some genetic experiment/rituals, the Netherfolk likely provided the other part. Or maybe, they are already distantly related to humans? Who knows. They are likely related to the Cavers too, another sapient but primitive humanoid species of largely troglodytes (based on the Falmer from Elder Scrolls, but with infrared vision).\n   * There is also megafauna fulfilling similar niches as mammoths and paraceratheria, resembling therapsids as well to a degree.\n* Dragons are very rare, terrestrial animals descended from hexapods. All of their six legs are connected through membranes, with the foremost two forming large limbs of a truly gigantic (in proportion to their body length) proportions (basically, they are a blend of \"classical\" Western dragons, wyverns and serpentine Eastern dragons). Most flying dragons are medium-sized, but some are truly titanic, only dwarved by the Leviathans of the seas. They are able to fly thanks to their huge wings and membranes that stretch all the way to the tip of their tails, feather-like growths, and air sacs (also, the planet's atmosphere is a bit thicker than Earth's as a side note). They are also very intelligent, possibly even sapient, although their form of sapience is vastly different from that of humanoids to the point that they are completely alien from each other, and they are even said to have an inborn connection to the Veil and the Abyss King. Dracomancers, thaumaturgists who have a connection to these dragons, appear multiple times in ancient legends and history, and have allegedly intervened in history during times of great disturbances (as in, other thaumaturgists rupturing the Veil too much). \n* An interesting side note is that, contrary to vertebrates on Earth who uniformely possess 2 (or 3, if you count the pineal eye present in some verts), paraverts generally have 4. The more archaic/primitive ones, as well as many extant aquatic and hexapodal ones (including dragons) have 4 very distinct ones, two each side of almost equal size. Generally, my idea was that one pair of eyes (for example, the outer pair) is better at seeing contrasts and at lower light levels, while the other is better in seeing colors. Basically, like cones and rods in our eyes, but with one pair for cones and rods each, or something similar, like one pair for infrared vision. Over time, these adapted however, and in many animals, one pair of eyes (the secondary from now on) shrunk significantly compared to the primary pair. For many animals, the eyes on either side of its head are also very close together, sometimes covered under a single eyelid. I have also played with the thought of having the two eyes seemingly \"fuse\" together, as in two eyes in one eyeball, for idk if I'm going too far with this. Maybe some (Speculative) Zoologist has an opinion on this? An eye with two pupils would certainly look badass. In any case, some animals like my horses and spearlynxes have two eyelids, so at the very least, their secondary eyes are close to the primaries and much smaller. In some animals, the secondaries are more evolved and specialized however, particularly in some cave-dwelling species which possess good infrared vision. (while only having two eyes, the humans of this world might also have a slightly extended range of vision, nowhere near that of some cave-dwelling species who really perceive the world in infrared, but maybe they see warm objects beginning to glow a bit earlier than we do...).\n\nWell, that's it for now. If you read this completely, congratulations, I consider you a fan of my work now. But honestly, I'd appreciate any kind of feedback, especially from those who've looked into Speculative Evolution before or have some knowledge in biology and zoology. I've always found that alien planets are perfect settings for Fantasy projects, so I've made the \"otherness\" of my world one of my priorities."

                "body": "I've been rather quiet about my worldbuilding project recently, but that doesn't mean that I didn't put some work into it. And oh boy, things have evolved. Where do I begin...\n\nAs before, while it is not Science Fiction (in the commonly understood sense) but instead more nested in the Fantasy genre, I put a lot of emphasis on scientific realism concerning the nature of my conworld: Despite there being a lot of supernatural, paranormal and magickal elements, the laws of physics, chemistry and biology are still valid in this universe (considering that I'm an aspiring astrophysicist, I try to use make use of my knowledge). My idea was to use realistic but very alien planets and celestial objects as settings in a more fantasy influenced project, as opposed to \"magical lands\" for weird settings and an Alternate Earth for the main setting.\n\n# Worlds:\n\nThese worlds are planets (and a moon) located in a loosely bound quintuple star system, orbiting different stars within it. They are connected via a network of ancient portal-like structures created by the extraterrestrial (or extra*tyras*trial) K'thraii civilization, my version of Elves who relied on eldritch thaumaturgy-fuel technology. \n\n* ***Tyrask\u00e4th:*** Tyrask\u00e4th is now the name given to the original world that I've been working on for a while now, though it's inhabitants call it \"Earth\" (in their respective languages). It's an Earth-like planet with roughly 1.15x its radius orbiting a pair of binary stars, both smaller than the Sun (K-type with \\~0.7 M\\_Sol and M-type with \\~0.3 M\\_Sol) in about half an Earth's year. Combined with the planets' slightly longer rotation period, this results in a year lasting 160 local days. The Suns orbit each other closely, resulting in the Golden Sun eclipsing the Copper Sun (and vice versa) every 8 local days. Due to the Suns' different light output, plants have different colors than they do on Earth: as most light comes from the Golden Sun, a K-type, plants take on a yellowish-orange color similar to plants here on Earth during autumn. A few other plants, however, take on a darker cyan hue. Tyrask\u00e4th has three moons, one of which similar in dimensions to our own moon, and two others that are significantly smaller (more like very large asteroids, tiny but already vaguely spherical) as well as a faint system of rings from a recent cosmic event (the moons' resonances help to stabilize the ring).   \nAside from orbiting binary stars and having three moons, Tyrask\u00e4th has a few more notable differences from Earth: for once, it is slightly larger, resulting in a stronger surface gravity (\\~1.2-1.25 g): I circumvented this by making my strand of humans (unrelated to Earth humans as it is a different universe) stronger with denser bones and muscles. It also has a denser atmosphere, so there are still large (and I mean LARGE) flying animals; a consequence of this is that winds are stronger and storms tend to be more violent. While it has a similar surface water coverage as the Earth, a large portion of the landmass is made up by a supercontinent covering much of its northern hemisphere. It has three more continents on the southern hemisphere too, although two of them are quite small (Australia and below) and the third one is largely submerged (like Zealandia). Another result of its higher mass is slightly stronger geological activity. The supercontinent, named Aviir, is in the process of slowly breaking apart. \n* ***Kasker\u00e4th:*** Kasker\u00e4th is a desert planet orbiting another orange Sun in the system. By desert planet I don't mean a Tatooine or Arrakis clone, or even a single biome planet: it has plenty of liquid water on its surface, but instead of oceans, it has lakes and small inland seas up to the size of the Mediterranean Sea. The planet itself is similar in size to the Earth. While very arid conditions are dominant, the regions in the seas' proximity are more humid, and might be classified as steppes or even savannas. The temperature range is also similar to that of Earth, meaning the desert ranges from the southern Sahara all the way to the Antarctic dry valleys. Basically, it is an Earth-sized version of what people used to believe Mars was like. \n* ***Vourask\u00e4th:*** Vourask\u00e4th is a pretty cool world. If Kasker\u00e4th is what Mars was like in retro sci-fi, then this planet is my take on retro Venus. I imagine they orbit the same Sun, with Vourask\u00e4th further inwards. It's smaller than both Tyrask\u00e4th and Kasker\u00e4th with lower gravity, and compared to the latter, much wetter: a large portion of its surface is covered in oceans, and unlike Aviir, most landmasses are long and narrow continents, island chains and atolls. Due to its proximity to its Sun, it's also a very warm planet: the oceans are constantly steaming (not boiling though), and the lowlands are, even on higher latitudes, stuffy, hot and extremely humid. Nightmarish animals, which I call pseudo-arthopods (they have internal skeletons) roam the dense fungal jungles, covered in a dense haze throughout most of the world's year. No sane human would live in these damp and oppressive lands, so instead, they live high up in alpine valleys, shielded by titanic mountains, where both temperature and humidity are bearable. This world is, in my opinion, the most interesting one from a speculative zoology standpoint.\n* ***Nurosk\u00e4th:*** Nurosk\u00e4th orbits a tiny red dwarf (which is part of a wider binary with the orange Sun previously mentioned) in very close proximity, close enough to become tidally locked. This results in one side being perpetually blasted by Sunlight, whereas the other side is shrouded in eternal night. Winds and bodies of water help in transferring the heat across the planets' surface, but it nonetheless results in it having unusual climate zones depending on how high the Sun is in the sky. The twilight lands, where the Sun hangs low above the horizon, is arguably the most pleasant and temperate region, and the one where humans not only live, but a certain subspecies originates from: the Ikirnai, my version of Dwarves: their origin myth even tells of an exodus through a mythical gate, from a land of perpetual twilight to one below two Suns, with day and night as well as easier steps. What does this mean? Nurosk\u00e4th is what we'd call a Super-Earth, it's gravity is about 1.75x greater than that of Earth, resulting in the humans evolving there (likely brought there by the K'Thraii) to become short, stout and incredibly strong (based strongman dwarves). Due to its Sun's weak light, plants are dark red to almost black.\n* ***Char\u00e4th:*** Char\u00e4th differs from the previous worlds in that it is not a planet, but a moon. It orbits a gas giant orbiting a white star (F-type), the most massive star of the system and the only one that is solitary, close enough for its largest moon to be habitable, though tidal effects likely play a role here too. The moon is about as big as Mars, and thanks to tidal effects, has active plate tectonics and a magnetic field (that is shown in my works through its very intense aurorae). While habitable, it is still fairly cold, with ice caps stretching down to low latitudes. A band of grayish-green vegetation, mostly tundra and taiga, stretches around the equator, interrupted by deep blue seas and the occasional fiery spot from its many active volcanoes. \n* The unknown home planet of the K'Thraii, severed from the other worlds.\n\nThe stars are, as mentioned, part of a nested quintuple system, containing an F-type star larger and more massive than the Sun, and two binaries, one of which is very close and consists of a K- and M-type star, the other one is wider (though still fairly close) and also consists of a K- and M-type star (or possibly, two M-type stars). \n\n# Settings:\n\nI'll just go over this quickly, as this deserves another post. I'm not building the world for a specific story in mind, instead the world itself is my priority (although I eventually want to write short stories and novellas set in my world). One of the most important aspects is the work on history, how cultures have evolved and changed etc. I will go into more detail on this in future posts when I find the time, but certain periods are of specific interest to me, which I will quickly illustrate:\n\n* \"Dawn Age\": Basically anything that happened before the previous Cycle (\\~20000 local years), dealing with the K'Thraii, their arrival on Tyrask\u00e4th, the origin of mankind, previous civilizations that rose and fell, the origin of thaumic forces in the world, the Great Cataclysm and the manifestations of the Abyss King and entities from Beyond the Veil (eldritch beings, basically). Hardly anything is known about what exactly happened there, and all but the most dedicated Dreamstriders only get short and chaotic flickers when trying to look back, as if something prevented them from seeing it.\n* \"Age of Legends\": More or less the Biblical Age of Tyrask\u00e4th. The Bronze and Iron Ages. The first cultures of the current Cycle, ancient empires, epic wars, glorious heroes and power being shifted across the face of the supercontinent. Also the formation of the first trading routes, discoveries of distant lands, and the rise of more \"abstract\" entities like political ideologies and religion.\n* \"Golden Age\": Pretty much the setting I've been working on the longest, and the closest to a typical Fantasy setting. Initially, it was very much based on European Medieval times like most Fantasy, though I've gotten a bit away from that, instead creating \"my own version\" of the Medieval period, similar but clearly set apart from that of our own Earth. The culture I'm mostly focussing on has parallels to the Byzantine Empire, as well as Germanic kingdoms from the Early Middle Ages, the Renaissance of Europe and feudal Japan. All in all, maybe Eastern Europe during the High Middle Ages with a lot of artistic license would be the closest approximation. I guess.\n* \"Age of Trembling Stars\": A sort of speculative future for this world, that is meant to be VERY different from your typical Sci-Fi setting. Instead, Thaumaturgy has become very powerful, while still remaining clandestine enough to not be easily accessible and, due to the nature of the Veil, learnable by the majority of humans. There is advanced technology that I partially based on Leonardo Da Vinci's models and ideas, mixed with more modern stuff that's well integrated (Schizo-Tech is the term to describe it best I'd say). Wheellock muskets with energy cells, used alongside swords and polearms forged of extremely resilient alloys, which is also used for projectile-resistant armor. There is even a sort of computer technology. The most advanced forms of technology, however, would incorporate Thaumaturgy as hinted above: space travel through rituals, carrying Vessels across the Veil to distant planets in the quintuple system, limited to upper classes or those who, through various means, have access to Thaumaturgists and Vessels). This is one the lesser developed settings, taking inspiration from Dune, some parts of Star Wars lore, and the Sword & Planet genre, but in my opinion perhaps the most interesting one. The other worlds beside Tyrask\u00e4th will become way more important here."

Longer?

I was a bit hurt, because he sounded so happy while talking to me, speaking about other people he met, but neither of us touched the recent breakup subject. \n\nRecently (the breakup was 6 months ago), on valentines, he told me he loved me \"as a joke\", but I knew that it was true, and later he told me he had feelings for me, and I know that he's aware that I don't feel the same, since I've been avoiding expressing any kind of \"love affection\" so he doesn't start getting dependant again.

I mean it's very much justified with the his father treated him. And I can't say I've never shared this desire, that's why I deeply emphasize with Shiggy, but do I think everyone in his postion would be like him? No, I think some people might have never had that desire and maybe never would've even under similar circumstances. \n\nThink Eri, she has a quirk with similar damage ability, also been abused but deeply expresses the desire to NEVER hurt someone, even in the most detrimental situtaions. \n\nI do think All For One definitly embraced and grown his hatred and villainous side but he also carried the potential that could be unlocked. He definitly carved out his path as villain and groomed him to become the perfect Leader and second self to him but to be realistic---I think with his quirk, Shiggy always would've had some villainous tendecies as it doese changes personalities of people and also births desires (see Toga) plus the fact he also carried that in himself. \n\nThat seems contradictory to what I said for Eri and I think this may actually just be a contradictory not fully actualized story line in the Series or it's due to thee fact that the rewind isn't inherently villainous in nature---compared fo decay or blood related quirks for example. Decay even if it can be used for good always will have a destructive nature to it and this shows in Shiggys personality. \n\nI think All for One really took Advantage and exhausterbated the emotions he needed for his plan from Shiggy in order for him to become a great succesor. It's clear Tenko felt disgust when he killed his family and was extremely disturbed, He doesn't completely lack empathy like a lot of the other villains seemed to do and that part All For One definitly groomed to his benefit. \n\nAnd yess, Shigaraki will obviously continue on this path if that's all he learned. People Just don't change over night. And also the liberation gave him a lot of relief. It's the one time he seems truly happy, not having to hold back and lock in his quirk. It is a given inner desire to use their quirk and now he finally could stopping all the suffering that had to go through with it. Who wouldn't do that tbh?",

Same with Ochako and Tenya, I thought they'd play bigger roles as dekus closest friends but they hardly played a major role for most throughout a large portion of the series. The growth with the specialties is super pruely done and I was ist like waiting for 3 seasons till All Might FINALLY trains deku (like you gave him you quirk, so don't you also kind of have responsibility to help him to use it) and with the other students it's hardly expanded upon even tho the training at school would've been an absolutely great upoortunity for that. \n\nI feel like there was a lot of freat potential for character story lines that kind of got wasted. With class B, even with the league of villains that could've both developed a bit along side 1A (after season 3, before it was great) but no. \nI still love the anime tho.",

                "body": "Toradora Criticism:\n\nFirst of all I have to admit that I truly did enjoy watching the show with all it's conflicts and characters but objectively speaking I don't think that it was really all that good and let me explain why.\n\nThere is very little character developmemt. While there are some hints with Taiga which I'm getting into later most of the cast tends to remain stagnat. Not just that but every side character only serves a specifc role/porpuse for the story while not really being portrayed in a more nuanced or complex way. \n\nE.g.. we see Minori solely out of the perspective of Ryuujis Crush (Not even Taigas best friend) which seems to be so far away and unattainble is she is never someone Ryuuji truly wants to get to know. They are somehow opposites: while he is pretty boring and mundane, she seems to spread the positivity and excitement that he wishes to have, however he is never able to reach her as she is just to different and he idealizes her. Honestly their relationship reminds me of a Manic Pixie dream girl which could be a story of istelf if they explored the topic more. \n\nAmi herself represent the anchor of the group and the events and the sort of puppet master. What I didn't get was her introduction. We get to know her as kind of a fake spoiled brat which we never saw her as, after her introcution. Yeah she may be slightly arrogant but not in any way truly egotistical and condescening (the only egoism we see are her flirt attempts with Ryuuji but honestly she still plays it in a way to leave all options open, for herself, Minori or Taiga). Instead we mostly see her as a truly intellegent girl who understands the whole workings of the situations of her friend group that she occasionally pushes (as in plays with) for answers. But nothing of this has anything to do with the dihcotomy of maintaining the image of a fake ditsy school vs a real condescending brat. Maybe the purpose of that was to immediatly be wary of Ami and to not necessarily like her because of her negative reputation from the beginning. Because otherwise a lot more people would probably rooting for Ami and Ryuuji instead of Taiga and Ryuuji and there would be literally no reason for Ryuuji not to go after her. \n\nWhich comed to my main issue. Ryuujis and Taigas Relationship. I know everyone is going sue me know but hear me out. While seperatly both characters are complex and well written and the porpuse to portray non-tradional romance is a good one as well I simply believe they failed in the delivery. Why? Nothing of Taigas and Ryuujis relationship is in any way healthy. And I don't just mean Taigas physical violence, that isn't the point (although it makes any form of a healthy relationship nearly impossible). I think that they actively hold each other back, by not just by covering but almost abusing their strength. While Ryuuji always solves Taigas problems (which she takes advantage of without ever truly being grateful or thankful which already frustrated Ryuuji during the swim episodes), he never truly regards her emotions and really calms her down. Instead he just does what she wants. Taiga therefore remains in her positon of being salty all the time since apperently it helps her to get what she wants (can't blame her). Ryuuji on the other hand is to set in stone in what's good for a person so he cometely disregards other ways of dealing things or adapting to Taiga to help her (e.g. Taigas father arc). His attempts to be for her emotionally often failed (culture festival) or disregarded completely (Kitamuras arc). \nThis creates a rather unhealthy dynamique were both enable the negative aspects of their personality. \nThey did adress this issue through Ami with her family anlogy that shows that Ryuuji is rather a caretaker for Taiga instead of an equal. So of course they had to work around that issue that they had however I don't think that it truly helped or change anything about it.\n\nThe Taiga leaving arc basicially is there for Taiga and Ryuuji both to grow seperatly to then be able to have a healthy relationship. We already saw Taiga trying to take care of herself more which is definitly a good start for the only character developmemt we saw. However I do think they overlook an important aspect with that. Those roles that they have, which also include Ryuuji being Taigas Caretaker, are the foundation of their entire realtionship as we never truly saw them interacting in other ways. So with Taiga leaving, that aspect basicially gets robbed. (Also on a sidenote if you can only grow through leaving your partner because you hold each other back so much then that's probably not a truly substantial relationship for the future as you are unable to truly grow while standing alongside walking your life path together) \nCleverly we never truly get to see how their relationship would look like (only indiacted through Taigas punch which could say parts of their relationship remained (still the same people) altough they grew into better versions of themselves? Then what's point in keeping unhealthy patterns such as Taigas violence that she nearly gave up during the Christmas arc after the Sumire fight. \n\nSpeaking of which I do believe Kitamura would've been a better for Taiga. They actually made each other better (Taiga becoming calmer and more at ease emotionally) and Kitmaura truly cared about Taigas emotions and opinions and actively helpt her. Taiga also truly cared about Kitmaura and tried to teach him lessons about him not being so self sacrificing. I think they truly complemented each other in a lot of positive ways. \nBut I could also see Kitmarua with quite a few characters: Sumire beacause she can motivate him to to follow his path and get moving towards his goals however we unfortunatly haven't seen on that many things he has to offer to her. Maya because they would probably have a fairly normal and sweet relationship. Ami because he accpets her truly for who she is (Even tho who she is may be arguable). Or Minori because they have a very similar energy level and sense of motivation which could truly unite them. \n\nSpeaking of which I wish we would've explored more her possible bisexuality and relationship to Taiga but that's another story. \n\nIn the end I think they could've been in healthier relaitonships with the people they had a crush on, or at least Taiga or another character (Ami) for Ryuuji which si kind of against the main point of the story of Taigas and Ryuujis ultimately being the best relationship. \n\nAnyways...\n\nThe way Taiga and Ryyuji fall in love is also, well, questionable? We may get a few hints here and there that make me think that least Taiga knew she loved Ryuuji during the swim arc however we never truly got that from Ryuuji (only before Christmas with Maya shortly) and we never truly explored their feelings for each other. Ryuuji and some point just realized that (while Taiga knew but simehow doesn't truly showed when and how) but maybe that's what they were aiming for, still they could've taken the chance show a Bit more of an affectionatdme side between Taiga and Ryuuji or more hints about their emotions.  \n\nBut well\n\nin Conclusion: I think Toradora had a lot of open story lines that they could've explored with the other characters but they choose to focus on their main relationship and the point they've been trying to make: crushes may be intense but eventually not lasting. So we should open us to the possibility of getting with someone who complemts us and who we actually get along with well in life, who truly knows us with all our flaws and is loyal despite. The problem with that however was that the Relationship that they chose is inherently unhealthy and didn't leave much room for growth.\nWhile they were aware of some of the issues, many of the arcs and character dynamiques felt more like excuses for the end goal of Taiga being with Ryuuji insead of fully stand alone story lines or charcters. \n\nOk, I'm sorry if this was too long and that it may drag such a beloved show too much. Of course everyone has their own opinion but I hope some still enjoyed my little Critique in Toradora."

But after weeks going by temperature has been rising, every day ranges from 20\u00baC to 28\u00baC being 24\u00baC the average temperature.\n\nI have watered it like 4 times, never watered it too much. \n\nIt clearly has gone down, it's not just dry, it lost a lot of it's balls. Think it's my fault for not providing it enought fresh air (windows closed some days) and i don't really have a clue on how to stop it from drying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really concerned about it, any kind of help you give me I'll appreciate it so much!!! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[When we bought it](https://preview.redd.it/4rflry9loq091.jpg?width=599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a9f89949fe4130001bcc2157adf8953f1ccf9c72)\n\n[Like 4 - 5 days after the previous pic](https://preview.redd.it/2qlpo0aloq091.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b99b71e6ee086d3c3f02917929b72f8ce6c4b87e)\n\n[This is how it looks right now :\\(](https://preview.redd.it/dukgr0aloq091.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e1dfce022905a360f555c82bed188f710a7a0059)\n\n[Another caption from today](https://preview.redd.it/jdqf72aloq091.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5de1bc5204cce871947e20d9b7a3d7947d597f14)"

                "body": "I just quit a job I really liked because I kept having to take time off due to illness and mental health issues. They started cutting my hours and I was eventually on  the schedule one day a week.\n\nI had gotten a job at Legoland where I could work in an environment with children having fun all day. Even better though it also  a very friendly environment for me; there was a very good office vibe and my coworkers were laid back and colorful people who I really liked being around. \n\nEverything was going really good at first then I got sick the first time and I didn't really think about that being something that what happened often, but that makes sense. Then the worst of the worst; the weekend after my first two weeks of working I had a chemical pregnancy and I have never been pregnant before. I was super depressed and I couldn't go to work for a few days. That was kind of the beginning of the end. After that I got sick more regularly the whole time I worked there which was only for about 2 months I was sick four times not including the chemical pregnancy. I had thoughts of suicide repeatedly and it got excessively worse. I was surprisingly sad being around so many little kids maybe because of the lost but seeing them so happy and cheerful made me somehow less happy and more melancholic. I got so bad I would just cry and cry and I would come home and I wouldn't want to do anything. I swung into major depressive episode and I didn't clean for weeks, I stopped sleeping, I was doing more and more excessive spending and shopping, doing things that were dangerous, and just kind of spiraling out of control. And make matters worse I took off work at least one day a week which I felt really guilty about and that made my depression even more intense. The more they cut my hours the more I realized they were trying to cut me out and that hurt because I wasn't doing it on purpose. I wasn't sick on purpose, I wasn't purposefully having mental health issues they just all kind of hit it once.\n\n But it's not just this job, I can't think of one single job I've ever had that didn't cause me severe burnout to the point where I just became pretty much useless after a certain point of time. I always start so good too and I feel like I'm really making progress and I feel productive and then everything just gets all screwed up. The saddest part is this is the worst time I've ever had at any job I've ever had, and it was my favorite job I ever had. I just feel really useless and now I have to find another job and I'll probably suck at that one too.\n\n Jobs aren't made for people who have mental health problems. Jobs are for people who can be stable, or at least pretend to be stable enough to pass daily without it running them into the ground. Sometimes we're lucky that we got out of bed at all. And with a job we have to get out of bed, make ourselves somewhat presentable, put on a fake personality we have to force if we feel horrible, or be accused of being on somthing because were so chipper, if depressed pretend we're a sparkly human being, for the duration of time it takes us to do our job at work and then by the time we get home we're like a tiny little crumpled up piece of paper and we have zero left for anything. Trying to work and take care of yourself simultaneously when you barely got enough energy to breathe is something that only we understand. Other people just, if they knew what we were going through maybe they make a job for us that would make us feel like we were capable of doing it without shutting down or if we did  need a break there would be more understanding of what we were going through.\n\nWere not lazy or bad employees who are purposefully not \"motivated\", \"dedicated\", or \"loyal\". We just get sick; we get tired and we require time for self care and reboots. This is and has been a constant struggle for me ever since I started working. I've had tons of jobs and I always try something new because I'm looking for the right one, I haven't found it yet, but im looking \ud83e\udd1e",

I know that it can be really hard to share your Kinks with people for fear that you'll be judged and it can cause a lot of repression and that can be unhealthy (unless your Kink is harmful and unconsentual then it in itself can be unhealthy)\nAnd that can make it difficult to adjust to a more open partner in the future if you wind up not staying together. \n\nThe fact he felt comfortable enough to share it with you at all and to be so transparent means he must feel okay being vulnerable with you. If you think you can be with him long term and you feel deep love and compatability then it's worth exploring options. Not anything you'd feel uncomfortable with but something that maybe would allow him to express his intrest in healthy ways but in a way that doesn't make you feel unsettled or queasy. Not only that but also so you can express your desires without either of you feeling uncomfy being honest about your wants or either of you feeling like your sexual give and take is becoming one sided.\n\nMaybe you could ask him about other things he's into and explore those if they are something you like too. Usually people have a few Kinks they're into and not just one. Maybe that could be a compromise and if you want to build a strong relationship the communication is definantly important. You can even explore your own Kinks if you have them and who knows, maybe he'll find he's into them and that way your sex life stays novel and exciting and he might not mind not sniffing if he's still getting something that is making him feel like one of his intrest/likes is being met.\n\nI believe that if you care about someone for real then you are not going to want then to be uncomfortable even if it's for something your into. For most people I think, part of the fun of sexual acrivity is seeing their partners enjoyment in the process. Just be very honest but also remind him that it's okay he's into it and that isn't what's upsetting you, that its more your own feelings towards it and that just because you don't like it, it's okay if he does. Sex is like food, some people like sushi others cant stomach it but that doesn't mean it's wrong or bad. You just have diffrent preferences on this particular instance.\n\nI wish you the best luck with your talk and your relationship \ud83e\udd70",

It's more intensified if he's been sweating at all and as gross as it sounds he'll come home after a day of work that was very active or after working out wanting a shower and I'll want to hug him and sniff him up because to me he smells amazing. I often burrow my face into his chest by his armpit because to me he smells soooooo sexy yummy \ud83d\ude0b  Dont get me wrong he smells good clean and fresh too but there is something very primitive about him reeking of \"man smell\" that really does make me just crazy for him, especially when I'm in heat \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udcaf %\n\nHe thinks I'm weird but has commented that at least I like the way he smells and I am attracted to him. The alternative would be me being grossed out by him and sexually put off, so when you think of it that way it's much better. And he has commented that he likes the way I smell \"natural\" too so he can't really be weirded out too much. He likes my sexy time sweat smell hahaha. \n\nWe are primitive at the core and it's part of us that makes us human. We are more evolved socially and we have adopted new forms of hygiene and we have expectaions of behaviors based off of those, but deep down we all have the lizard brain mindset (eat it,kill it, f*ck it) and for some of us smells are part of arousal and desire.",

Maybe he can smell it on you and it amps up his desire to enjoy you that way?? Especially if he's more inclinded to do so around the same time monthy. If that's the case maybe just ask him to sniff from the frontside so it feels more like it's a sexual animalistic desire to have your kitty than him trying to sniff your butt.",

But not like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday night I had a dream that a lady in her 70's or 80's brought me to her house accompanied by two men one younger in his late 20's and the other older in his late 50's or so. We had met at a restaurant around the outdoor seating and they invited me over as the lady and I had met before. They took me in a car to her home through a parking garage similar to a tunnel of color. Then into a semi-opened garage and I could see a little girl in the next yard over, playing she was the younger man's daughter. We enter the house I go into a dark but light living room area the younger man turns to me looks at the man and lady oddly and excuses himself to see his child. They look at me then each other and smile rather oddly at me. I hear music coming from where the light is flowing into the room at a room dividing wall that leads to a kitchen. Violins screeching dizzily and eerily. I heard it before only I can't recall where. A little old man comes for me I don't know his age but he grabbed at my hand as the man and woman were distracted turning towards the music in anticipation of something. I was curious about what the were waiting for and about the music, the man though pulling at me looked so distressed. He pulled very forcefully me down a hall in the opposite direction that was also very dark then out a door to be met with blinding sunlight. He shut the door quickly and caught my long hair in it. \"My hair,\" I said to him with a bit of distress in my voice in almost a whisper. He turned around to look at me with horror on his face and opened the door and I turned around pulled my hair out and as he shut the door he pushed me back and I woke up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe saved me from something and I don't know what it was but I can't have been good. This was too real almost as if I lived in two dimensions and I needed to get back to this one before something horrific happened to me. It isn't the first brush with the strange musical being that lurks in the dark. I have been tormented by this entity since I was a child. The older I get the bolder it gets and more cunning, it lures me now and tries to ... do something to me. I want me to see it finally after all this time to hear it for me to know what its intentions are. About a year ago it spoke to me for the first time and I woke inconsolable and irrational for hours thinking it was coming for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else have this ??? Is anyone being terrorized and delivered from a horrible thing inside your brain??? My mind seems to be protecting me by placing escape routes and people to get me away but this time I actually had to be pushed out. Forcibly evacuated from my dream to save me. What if I don't get out next time? What will happen to me then? I dont know its just so unsettling."

He was likely also a doctor and might have held important political positions.\n\nAs you can imagine, with this information it's likely that he'll become a dendro botanist/gardener/scholar character, or just dendro. My question is, how likely do you think it is that he's really the inspiration for Genshin's Tighnari?\n\nSomething curious I've found is that Al-Tighnari was more of a nickname than anything else. His real name was   *Ab\u016b \\`Abd All\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad b. M\u0101lik al-M\u016brr\u012b al-\u1e24\u0101\u0177\u0177 al-Garn\u0101\u1e6d\u012b,* known as Al-Tighnari because he was from Tignar, a village north of Granada. Basically, Al-Tighnari means \"the one from Tignar\" or \"the Tignarian\". That said, I don't speak Arabic and I'm not familiar with the names that are common in the language, but unless someone can confirm that Tighnari can be just a random Arabic name or something unrelated with andalusi Al-Tighnari, the chances that it's a direct reference to him are high.\n\nNow excuse me if I'm rambling a little but this makes me think of the possible inspirations for Sumeru as a whole. We know it will most likely be based on the Middle East, but so far all I could see is that the origins and inspirations seem all over the place (unlike Liyue and Inazuma that seem more self-contained in their respective countries as pseudo-China and pseudo-Japan), and *if* this is true, we might need to add medieval Southern Spain/Portugal to the list of influences for Sumeru. It kinda makes sense historically, but it certainly gets a bit far away from the Middle Eastern and South Asian inspiration. Andalusia is still today well known for its beautiful gardens and patios due to Al-\u00c1ndalus heritage, so at least aesthetically it should work out nicely as dendro region if it's included.\n\nWhat do you think?"

Ideally I would like a small plant that doesn't grow too much and take up a lot of space on my desk and/or one that I can clip to keep small.\n\nMy room has a balcony that faces north-west on a very warm and sunny weather. It gets what I think is pretty good indirect sunlight during winter and in the morning all year, but in the summer afternoons/evenings it turns into an oven under the direct sun and I have to keep the blinds down for several hours a day (I try to leave at least a 10-20% opening at floor level but some days are just *that* hot, and it depends on whether I'm there or not). The plant would be on my desk right next to the balcony, so it would get the maximum light that gets in the room except for putting it directly on the floor. \n\nIs it possible to keep a plant alive in these circumstances at all, even with a resilient type? I can move it to another place in the house if it doesn't work for my room but I was really wanting a desk plant that would look cute.\n\nI thought of a pothos or similar but I don't want it to vine and don't know if keeping it small is a good idea, and succulents fit my size requirements but would probably more need light all day. Other plants I've researched for beginners and that survive in different light settings seem to get too big or are difficult or impossible to find here. Any ideas? I can show the room if necessary."

I was wrong in the best way possible, the reputation is well deserved. Last 200-300 read in basically one sitting (stopped to eat, not sure if I would have stopped to sleep if it had been night time) in both books. I think I liked the avalanche in WoR more, it's just so epic.\n\nA few thoughts about the book:\n\nYou have no idea how much I enjoyed the interactions between the POVs, *specially* when they couldn't stand each other (see Kaladin/Adolin in particular). I laughed out loud when Zahel said they're actually very similar because I had been thinking just that all book. Seeing them slowly and reluctantly becoming sort of friends was also very cute, I'm so proud of them.\n\nI'm *not* enjoying the potential romance between Shallan and Kaladin although I was sorta seeing it coming because of tropes alone. The way things are right now, it looks like it would bring a lot of drama with Adolin, and I'm not a fan of love triangles. I just hope I don't hate it too much moving forwards.\n\nApart from that, Shallan's arc in this book is super interesting to me, the themes about lies and illusions and art fit together so nicely. As an artist myself, I was super happy to see an artist character period, specially in a way that doesn't antagonize art and logic/science, but seeing how it's not just a random interest for her but that it actually serves the story... It's so satisfying. I can't say I like her as a person or that I understand all of her choices, but I like her a lot as a character.\n\nAlso, this line about *Renarin*, of all people?\n\n> Great. He was creepy *and* whiny\n\nHow DARE she? And it was out of nowhere. Seriously, I audibly said \"wow that's so mean\" when I read that. Renarin is not only best boyo but, if I'm not completely mistaken, he reads as autistic to me, which makes that comment even worse. I don't even mind her being rude while teasing people, I get it, you want to be edgy, but heck, that was so uncalled for. I have a special place in my heart for soft boys, in case you didn't notice.\n\nOn that topic, Renarin being a Radiant went completely over my head, I thought the stuff he said had to do with Dalinar's visions. I really want to see more of him. I didn't see Shardblades being literal spren coming either. Shallan having killed her mum was pretty obvious (the foreshadowing was so strong on that one), but I never thought the blade itself could be Pattern, I was struggling trying to guess where she got it from (I thought it was either her dad's or her mum's). \n\nI never believed *for a second* that Jasnah was dead. Firstly, there's no body. She disappeared and Shallan thinks the attackers had moved her, but I was like \"*doubt*\". But more importantly, we never learned what was her second Surge, only that she shares Soulcasting with Shallan. I was *sure* she had used the second Surge to escape. The Ars Arcanum has the clue of what it is too.\n\n\nAnd I'll leave it here before I start rambling (yes, this long ass post isn't even close to rambling for me). If you made it this far, congratulations, you can ask me anything if you want. Anyway, in conclusion: I am officially in love with this series. I even made fanart of it in the middle of a months long artblock. Since I don't own Oathbringer yet, I'll make a pause now (as much as my body is asking me to go buy the last two books right away, but also I don't want them to end too quickly) and read other stuff, along with Warbreaker and Edgedancer. I'm not sure if I'll make it very long before I give in, but we'll see."

I'm planning on making a Pok\u00e9mon series all with the same base so that means a lot of sewing and I'm not looking forward to it.\n\nI was wondering if there are any tips I could use or it is just about grinding and redoing if needed. \n\nI started using pins to secure the parts before sewing and that has helped a lot, along with comparing stitches on both sides to make sure I sew them exactly on the same round/stitch, but even when the positioning is right, a lot of the times I end up with shifted parts (like if I wanted to hide a colour change by putting that side facing down, sometimes the colour change still shows up on one side because the leg or whatever has shifted clockwise). It doesn't help that the patterns I'm working with are rather small so even a couple of stitches off would be noticeable. It's so frustrating. \n\nDoes anybody else hate sewing parts too or is this a newbie thing?"

But the cruelty of Tien's wholesome little soul being forced to fight in war when he can't even see blood is probably far worse than the most gruesome death I could have imagined and it's crushing my heart :( .  I realise that Tien's whole character is designed to be the personification of the \"I've only had Tien for a day and a half, but if anything happened to him, I'd kill everyone in this room and then myself\" meme, but let me be, it's working lol. Not even the bridgemen's misery made me feel like this. If he ends up not dying but becoming a bad person I don't think I can take it lmao. \n\nNow Kaladin's saviour complex and why he used to recruit inexperienced boys just to protect them makes a lot more sense. It's not just a vague resemblance to his brother, that's quite literally what happened to him. And obviously they had the typical relaxed and heartfelt moment on their roof's house, just before their hopes would be crushed. I should have seen it but it totally went over my head. \n\nAlso somewhat unrelated but shame on Lirin for mentioning \"their plan\" when Kaladin decided to join the army too. I get that he feels he just lost both of them but he sounded like he had made peace way too fast with Tien's inevitable death as long as his other son would get his precious education so that he could potentially get more status someday.\n\nI just thought the execution was great and needed to rant about it. Well done, Sanderson, well done.\n\nEdit: Well I only read a couple of chapters more and so far:\n\n1. >!It is revealed that Kaladin \"won\" a Shardblade!< HA, called this one.\n\n2. >!Shallan managed to Soulcast (creepy!) and committed self-harm!<\n\n3. >!Someone tried to poison her, and the stolen Soulcaster is finally exposed!<\n\nAaaand the plot is starting to pick up the pace YAY"

It was almost irrational, until recently when I realized that I am at least some shade of non-binary, and now that I have the vocabulary to do so I'm convinced that my reluctance is because it feels too feminine. I already present rather femme and I think I have pretty feminine facial features, so I think not fixing my eyebrows was my way to even things out a bit.\n\nI'm still coming to terms with being nb and dealing with impostor syndrome, but a month ago I was very adamantly saying I didn't experience any kind of physical dysphoria and now I want to get a binder more and more as days go by (is this normal??), so who knows where I will end up a year from now. Thank you all for helping me in my journey!\n\n\nDisclaimer: I do realize that fixing eyebrows is not exclusive to women or any gender in particular, and that even among cis men it has become fairly popular to do it.    But gender roles go brr."

It (along with other medium to high energy terrier or hunting dogs) was in the top choice for me. \n\nHowever, my lifestyle calls for small, low energy companion dogs. I\u2019m not a very active person so I always look for low energy breeds. I had marked in the test that I wanted a couch potato, but also truthfully said I could give 30-45 minutes daily walks, which leads me to believe that was why I was given medium-high energy breeds. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me being inexperienced with high energy dogs and also getting a wacky test result, but I feel like those breeds would need more than 45 minutes daily walk? \n\nAnyway, seeing that outcome made me wonder just how high is high energy? Does it vary by breed? Do daily walks not count as exercise like playtime? I\u2019d love to hear personal experience from owners of high breeds! I\u2019ve always wanted to own a small, medium to high energy breed, but I am of a low energy person so have been wary of that. \n\nIf it\u2019s any insight, I currently have a Lhasa apso and he is a couch potato. He will sleep all day and is mellow, but he also has a lot of energy when taken out and will go on two hour hikes. He\u2019s one of those versatile dogs ha.\n\nEDIT: thank you all for the responses!! They were incredibly insightful and helped me know more about high energy breeds in general. I still don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to own one, but maybe one day I\u2019ll work up the ladder and find a dog that\u2019s of medium energy first (makes sense after all)."

Some people say it was their world, their inner world, shattering.\n\nFor me, it felt like all around me were mirrors. Mirrors that shifted on gears and mechanical tracks. They all fell off their tracks, the mirrors that were reflecting the lie I was living in. Another way to say it would be the bubble I was living in popped. If it was a thousand bubbles, and the enormous roar they made as they popped sounded like glass breaking. Or the quiet turbulence of a huge master volume/book fluttering its pages shut. The story of everything we could have been\u2014the story of us. Fluttering shut and the cover slamming, never to be opened again. \n\nThrowing that book into the fire and hearing our future whispering all the stories we would have written in it. Our stories, written in invisible ink, not yet told. It\u2019s all the \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d and \u201cwhys\u201d and my resentment for you grows a hundredfold. And I realize you\u2019re doing the same. You blame me for it. And so we sit at opposite sides of the fire, listening to the stories that our book makes as it goes up in flames. As the life we would have lived turns to ash. I used to try and understand why. \u201cWhy did you do it.\u201d But there\u2019s no answer that you could ever give me that would be acceptable. There\u2019s no excuse for the abuse. There is no \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d that you could say that would make up for it. \n\nSo I get up and walk away from the fire that consumed you, consumed our relationship. I console myself with the knowledge and truth that it wasn\u2019t a relationship\u2014it was an experience. An experience which I\u2019m going to learn how to run with, and use it to my best advantage\u2014something that you taught me. I\u2019m walking away from the bonfire. I know you\u2019ll follow for a time, to try and tell me what our book is whispering. You\u2019ll be right on my heels for what\u2019ll seem like forever. But in the entire existence that is my lifetime, it will really only be a blip. A moment. What is a year compared to 80 or 90? \n\nYou are a blip in my life. A flash of magnesium. I will keep moving forward, away from you, away from the \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d stories. The longer I sit by the fire and listen to the stories, the less of my life I get to live. Your comfort is no longer my concern\u2014remember when I first said that to you all those months ago? Your attempts at communication: the bullying, the threats, only prove to me that I\u2019m making the right decision. It\u2019s why everyone runs, not walks, away from you.\n\nI can\u2019t look back, can\u2019t stop running. Or I would be turned to salt. And that is, quite simply, not an option for me. That is why I will never listen to you again, will never trust you again, will never give you the opportunity to hurt me again. Because in reality, when all the stories of \u201cwhat could have been\u201d are burned, the only thing left is your despair and abuse. I will never look back on that again. The abuse does not define me\u2014who I make myself into *does.*"

Perfect temperature, perfect bubbles (or no bubbles, if that\u2019s not your thing), perfect scent, perfect music, etc etc. you get the drift.\nIt\u2019s perfect and completely catered to everything you want/need, because they\u2019ve studied you. It\u2019s the best damn bath you\u2019ve ever had in your life. Your eyes are wide with amazement: \u201cwow!! Someone who finally understands just how you like a bath.\u201d\n\nBut then they come in with a big bucket of ice water. And they just dump it on your head. It\u2019s such a shock to the system, you lurch out of the water. Little ice cubes rock back and forth around your shins in the water, dissolving into nothing. You look around in terror and they explain they didn\u2019t get a proper \u201cthank you\u201d for the initial drawing of the bathtub. Didn\u2019t they make it perfect? Wasn\u2019t it just right? You weren\u2019t quite grateful enough, were you? And no, by the way, they *didnt* just drop a bucket of ice cold water on your head. You\u2019re *crazy*, you need to take meds. But no, you weren\u2019t grateful enough. And you look around, the ice cubes have dissolved now and you\u2019re just in shock. Utter disbelief. I guess that didn\u2019t just happen? There\u2019s still your music playing. But you\u2019re gasping, your skin is red and chafed from the ice water. But your favorite scent is still floating through the air. Was it real? That person can\u2019t be both *that* and *this*? \n\nSo you sit back down. And then a few mins later, they come back in with an ice bucket of water again. And they dump it on your head again. But this time isn\u2019t as much of a shock. The temp of the water has cooled due to the first bucket of water. You\u2019re prepared a bit more, but it\u2019s still cold as hell. And the same argument ensues. But how are you supposed to thank someone for throwing a bucket of water on your head? Now you\u2019re sure they\u2019re doing it on purpose. But they\u2019re emphatic that you\u2019re the one causing this mess. \n\nJust get out of the damn tub. \n\nIs it not enough that it\u2019s always done in the most vulnerable state, you\u2019re bare and vulnerable and therefore the most susceptible to abuse? Recognize that any encounter with a narcissist is transactional. It\u2019s a point based system and any encounter will leave you (in their mind) in deficit. Stop reaching out to these people. Stop letting it slip. You\u2019re just asking for more ice water on your head. Every single encounter ends this way. Get out of the tub.\n\nEdit: thank you so much for all the awards and sharing of your own experiences. I had written this down in my journal yesterday, and decided to write it here. I never thought it would resonate with so many. You have no idea how much joy it brings me to see everyone together, sharing, and taking comfort in one another. I take comfort in each and every one of you! Here\u2019s to getting out of the tub \ud83c\udf7b"

At one time, we are all like Atlas with the burden of a narc on our back. Trying to hold it up. Trying to keep it up. Unable to reach out even a hand for help, the weight was just too much. But then we did, we came here or sought help. Getting out from under it is the hardest part. But that\u2019s where no contact comes in. In a sense, we\u2019re all alcoholics, and maintaining any form of contact with a narc is like asking the bottle why you\u2019re an alcoholic. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. They abused you, they\u2019re not going to help you break a trauma bond, if anything they\u2019re going to help reinforce that trauma bond. Don\u2019t go looking for closure, an apology, anything from them."

                "body": "This occurred earlier today in North Florida. Although unaware, this man embodies aspects of stoicism that I thought had to be shared with this community:\n\n\nI went to Circle K to get a Gatorade while I was headed to the gym, and on my way out a man with a cane, an overloaded backpack, and a ripped up plastic grocery bag, asked to bump a cigarette. I told him I'm sorry and that I didn't have any, even though I knew damn well I did. He looked at me, and simply said \"It's all good man, it's a beautiful day. I hope you had a good one, be safe, all love\". \n\nI proceeded to get in my car, and put it in drive. Yet, on the way out of the parking lot, I saw this man hobbling, silently begging for a break from the pain stemming from his clearly injured leg. This really made me think: this man is clearly homeless, walking on an injured leg, carrying a heavy backpack, needing a cane, and took the actual time to genuinely care about MY day, with nothing but respect throughout his entire encounter. \n\nSafe to say, I opened my door, asked him where he was going, and it was right next to the gym of which I was headed. Turns out, this man was just trying to calm his nerves with a cigarette while he hobbled his way to the laundromat to clean his 2 pairs of clothes with whatever change he has left in his pocket.\n\nSo we took a little drive up the road after he courteously asked where to sit, and I caught a glance of his multiple hospital bracelets. Well, he has chronic diabetes, and within the past 2 years has been unable to afford the medicine that he needs, so every time he requires insulin he hobbles all the way to the hospital across town, and was so ashamed of his dirty clothes that he took a trip all the way to use the last bit of his money to clean them.\n\nArriving to the laundromat, I gladly pulled out a pack to spend some time with this genuine man who had no one else who would show any ounce of compassion. This is where I learned the disgusting story that he was hobbling due to the absolute selfishness of someone who was so impatient to get into a Publix parking lot that they actually clipped him and didn't give any care towards it. No second thought. Yet, there he was, just happy to get a ride from a stranger, and have a second to feel a sense of calm and human connection.\n\nWell, this is my new buddy Mike from Delaware. He used to be a cook at the FAMU dining hall after traveling away from his family some years ago. Now he can't afford a roof over his head, let alone a decent meal. Little does he know how emphatically, yet unknowingly, he embodies the basic human foundation of genuine kindness... because he does it without any thought, without any effort... As we all should strive to do. \n\nThis is a grounding moment, where you can take all of your problems, and all of your stresses and worries, and realize that there are people who have it worse than you could even fathom, and they will be better in their heart, and soul, through their actions, than someone who has it all.\n\nI was having a decently bad day, but this mutualistic interaction between two people, who live such different lives, but truly want to just love everyone through virtue and faith, made me realize it wasn't bad at all.\n\nAshing the flames, Mike reached out his hand to give me a fist bump, and I slipped a crushed up folded dollar into his hand as we simultaneously said \"Love you brotha\". \n\nYour situation doesn't matter, your mindset does.\n\nI should be more like my new friend Mike. We all should.\n\nThat's what life is all about. Open your hearts. God bless"

We went on a date about 7 weeks ago, and then she went MIA as she didn't know where she wanted. To make it short, we talked about it this past Friday and she said her reasoning was that she truly couldn't believe I was as good as I am (her words) and that when I gave her space for a month-ish it helped her come to terms.\n\nAnyways, we both like each other but she's very shy and doesn't initiate anything. It's so different from the other girls I've talked to at my age. She texts back every time, flirts, etc., but for some reason I feel like it's not moving like it should. She takes a few hours to text back when we work throughout the day, and about 20 mins every other time. \n\nMy question is: how often should I initiate conversation with/contact her at this point? Are there certain strategies? How do I gain her interest more?\n\nShe says how much she likes me, and remembers literally everything about me, and we get along flawlessly... This is just way different than anything I've been involved with before. \n\nTLDR: Me and this girl have mutual feelings, but I'm not sure how I should go about it at this point after not knowing each other too well"

I find a bite of unpeeled string cheese satisfying in and of itself, it has a unique texture when biting into it: soft but slightly resistant, it makes the moment your teeth meet at the end that much more satisfying, it's better than eating it peeled."
