How laning phase ends up to is all depended on my support, with reactive I mean that I'm always ready for agressive action, but it's up to my support to initiate it. And I love if I have an agressive one, it usually means a winning laningphase.\n\nI never try to outperform my team, I'm kinda adapting to be in the middle.  I have a hard time being ego, and put a lot of energy being available if mistakes is done by my teammates.\n\nI've noticed my damage output is weak, not sure if it's because I'm not doing much of micro moves or too passive/bad at being around where fights is. I'm generally bad at dying, which is good(?)\n\nSeems my best champ is Jhin, which is more of an utility adc.

He's the one who demands respect while not giving it. \n\nI think Gwen had a good relationship with one of Robyn's daughters for a while, which likely means they spent time at each others houses more when they were in Vegas, so she probably saw a different side of of Robyn.",

That is unless he had come to the airport or let them know he was coming to talk to her. I'm watching the series over and everytime I wonder why no one warned her. I'm sure they were concerned with overwhelming her, and I understand not telling her at the airport but I feel badly for her with how it played out. \n\n\n2nd. I'm sure this has been answered but I didn't know how to search for it. Could a lawyer get the kidnapper off for an unlawful search? It sounded like Michaela was technically still a cop, so she needed a a warrant since there was no logical/apparent immediate threat or obvious clue they were there. I know it has nothing to do with the show, and it's not a dig at the show. I'm just curious if anyone knows how that might play out."

If thats right how does wish Hook look young? I'm rewatching the wish episode now and I've been wondering for a while how grey and older Hook becomes young wish Hook. If im wrong and he's not the same as wish Hook, well I'm embarrassed and disregard my post. \n\n\n I know I should probably just watch it, and I probably will one day. It's just been bothering me for a while.\n\nETA- since my question has been answered (thank you) and I'm still watching the wish episode. Can I just say bravo to Belle for actually going straight to David and Hook instead of hiding the fact Gideon is her son and asking for help. I know it what makes it a show but how many problems on this show are from people trying to hide something or do everything on their own?"

I think it played out wonderfully and that even the cartoon Elsa would have found a friend in Emma. Maybe now because I am not Frozened out, I actually think the entire story was pretty good. Not always the best writing or pacing but still the story itself is enjoyable for me. \n\nI also like that they called out how often Emma has saved them, with little appreciation and Anna was perfectly cast and played. \n\n\nIn general I find rewatches of shows  or rereading a book changes my opinion on many things.  I usually find myself softening or understanding unlikable characters and appreciatingdifferent aspects of a storh.

For nearly 2 days I wasn't even able to find some relief from ibuprofen  and found very little from  my heating pad. My heating pad usually really helps. This tends to happen when it's been 60+ days since my last period.\n\n Thankfully I'm doing better now with the occasional intense pain, just like a normally feel on day 3.  I joke thay this period has kicked my butt because I'm actually exhausted from the pain.  Usually the emotional side of things make me feel that way, that is a whole other issue though.  I'm starting to question whether I'll be able to handle childbirth because I honestly could barely handle the last couple days. \n\nSo anyway does anyone else have times likes this where it's so much worse than their already terrible periods? \n\nI have unconfirmed probable endo.

The town had a country sticks kind of feel. I believe the people in town constantly referred to her brother as dumb and slow. She had to protect her brother from getting in trouble because she knew he had killed someone. He did so in an effort to save the protagonist,  or at least he thought she was in danger. There was an older boy in town who had been bothering her, I don't remember if that was who the brother killed though.

Maybe you always bring a backpack everywhere so you start collecting buttons from all the places you see, and pin them on. Or maybe you cook a lot, so you slowly replace all your kitchen cooking utensils with ones you get from your trips. It could be anything, but the important part is bringing items into \"good use.\"\n\nI also want to offer a reminder to other commenters about the definition of a souvenir:\n\n**Souvenir** ***n. a thing that is kept as a reminder of a person, place, or event***\n\nSo the idea of a consumable, like coffee beans, being a souvenir, simply doesn't fit the definition. It may have been bought in transit and with good memories, but if it isn't *kept* then it's not a souvenir.\n\nI like this question for this community because the idea of us keeping things is definitely counter-culture!

So right there I'm saving $760 per month by living IN the city. My lower income also qualifies me for FREE MassHealth (-$290).

I'm not living rent-free, but I am paying affordable rent. I save about $200 on rent doing this, so that's a savings of $2,400 per year. You're saving all the rent by living with mom & dad, but I wonder if you could save on all that pot if you just moved out into a better situation (also have lived in an active suicidal roommate household a few years back, and had to go on anti-depressants; positive environment is \\*very important\\* for mental health)\n\nBut I just wanted to lay this all out for you because I hear a lot of woe is me financial stuff from my bff who has a similar rent, similar income, but her spending is simply out of control.

So just... take a long hard look at what expenses are actually essential, because other than a phone, and food, I can't think of anything that really, really is. That's the real answer to financial freedom.\n\nOh, and I'm saving like $1000/month despite my income, just by watching my spending. Imagine if you could SAVE $12K a year! Could it buy a house in MA?

                "body": "Long story short: The manufacturers of drugs do not use equivalent inactive ingredients, and may cause violently different reactions.\n\nLong story long:\n\nI\u2019ve been on bupropion twice before now, 2015-2016 and 2017, for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Given my history of body dysmorphia, I had requested an anti-depressant guaranteed not to cause weight gain, or fuck up my sex drive. My best friend died in March. At first I fought restarting drugs, but finally realized I needed the help, and gave in circa early June after having some very low thoughts.\n\nMy previous experiences on bupropion have been consistently positive. Near-immediate (1 week in) mood improvements, increased focus to the point where my ADD is eliminated, and best of all I feel like \u201cthe old me,\u201d that is, the me before the low/frantic/panicky feelings struck. On it I went from having panic attacks 5x/week, to having none. From never leaving the bed and losing my job, to starting my own business. It's a wonder drug for me.\n\nSo on June 5 when I started up bupropion XL 150 (same as always), I thought, \u201cThis will do the trick.\u201d\n\nBy four days later I had made a suicide plan for the first time in my life, and had such apathy about living (usually my depression leads me to feel despondent, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve felt apathetic about anything ever; I\u2019m one of those people who has a strong opinion about everything) that all of my prior feels about dying or leaving behind a mess were gone. I was an empty shell. Had my friend not come and sat with me the entire day morning to night, I really don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened.\n\nBut it took me until 2.5 weeks later of feeling like this to realize: hey this isn\u2019t normal. Called doctor, \u201cCould this be a weird post-COVID reaction?\u201d (I had COVID last March and have \"long-haul syndrome\": lingering lung and brain effects. Goldfish-style memory. Forgetting words constantly. Could barely breathe for the first 9 months post.) Their response? Give it time. \u201cSometimes these things take 6-12 weeks to work.\u201d Not for me, but ok doc. **Felt suicidal every single day for all of the first 30 days**. Other fun symptoms: testosterone rage fits, edginess, night sweats, non-existent sex drive, weight gain(!!!). I blew up my relationship, housing, and job. By day 30 I had nothing to live for, literally.\n\nDay 31, refilled my script. By the end of that week, started to feel marked improvements, both in my mood and my on-edge feeling. By week 6, like magic, it was like it was 2015 again. I was me. Hallelujah.\n\nDuring the \u201cwtf is this med doing to me\u201d period in June, I discussed switching to name brand. \u201cmaybe it\u2019s the fillers in the generic,\u201d I say. In August, days 61-90, insurance approved brand name Wellbutrin.\n\nAugust: migraines with auras at least every other day, inability to sleep more than 5 hours, constant fatigue but could not turn off brain long enough to nap, and then my favorite: my teeth now stick to my lips. What? Yes. I sometimes would tear off pieces of the inside of my lips because they\u2019d get stuck to my teeth as if they were made of sticky sandpaper. Didn\u2019t matter how much water I drink. I also now have something called \"burning mouth syndrome\" where spicy foods, and even salt, tastes so spicy that it erodes the skin on my hard palate as I'd just ingested piping hot liquid. I can't feel the tip of my tongue for 24-48 hours. And by \"spicy\" I mean like Cool Ranch Doritos. Oh, and I started seeing phantom black things in my periphery that were not there, which can be a first sign of psychosis. (!!!)\n\nBasically immediately I asked to go back to generic. Insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it. Saw a specialist that said it\u2019s common to have reactions to the dyes in the name brand, and that could be what\u2019s happened.\n\nSeptember: back to generic. I open my paper bag with a 90-day bottle of generic and\u2026 it\u2019s white. All others were orange. Called pharmacy: \u201cHey do you usually pour out 90-day bottles into other, orange, 30-day bottles? Oh, no? Well can you confirm this is the same thing I was on in June and July?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t on the same thing in June and July.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh well can I go back on what I was on in June and July.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I mean you were on two different manufacturers in June and July. What you just got is a third manufacturer.\u201d\n\n*WHAT THE !!!!!!*\n\nDue to insurance putting up a fight I had to be on generic manufacturer #3 for four days before a script for manufacturer #2 (i.e. the month of feeling back to normal) was approved. During that time I felt a lot of the side effects present during my time on manufacturer #1 (i.e. suicidal month), including extreme rage/edginess, night sweats, migraine, with the addition of two more fun side effects: massive fatigue leading me to be awake only 10 hours a day, and unprompted uncontrollable crying fits as if someone came out of thin air and slapped me in the face.\n\nI am now on Sun brand bupropion (manufacturer #2) and having an epicly better time. Sleeping like a normal person, mood stabilized, have energy but not too much, my sex drive is back, and I'm already losing weight here on day 5.\n\nSo the moral of my fucked up story is: despite what insurance companies believe, **NOT ALL GENERIC MANUFACTURINGS OF DRUGS ARE EQUIVALENT**. And the brand name might not be best either!\n\nAnd you, like me, might have an allergy to an inactive ingredient in one iteration and not another. Don\u2019t give up on a drug after one try, especially if it\u2019s worked in the past. And probably get allergy tested.\n\nBest of luck to everyone, and fuck you, Lupin Pharmaceuticals!"

I increased my water intake dramatically (am usually dehydrated), started taking electrolyte salts containing magnesium, increased fiber via lentils/beans/dates, ate all FODMAPS that I have a slight sensitivity to at once, including yogurt, and drank kombucha. This produces gas and bloating, but still results in hard, small, highly infrequent BMs. \n\nThe only med I take regularly is LoLoestrin FE, continuous no break (so without the Fe pills on the off days), which I\u2019ve done for ~8 years. \n\nI do light exercise daily and tried increasing this to an actual workout with zero results on my gut. \n\nTil I took senna tea on day 14, I also had a non-stop migraine with visual aura and blurry vision. The tea took 24 hours to take effect (instead of the predicted 6-12) and even then, had one hard small log followed by one smooth one. Then nothing for the past 2 days. \n\nI find this phenomenon fascinating because I\u2019m getting all the internal feelings like I will have diarrhea (rumbly tummy, gas, urgency), but then it\u2019s either just gas, or the BM is so hard to pass that I have to abandon the process. \n\nWhat could be the cause? \nHow else could I reset my gut?"

The landlord is aware of the subletting and could care less as long as he gets rent monthly. The subletter just moved in Aug 15, and I was traveling Aug 27-Sept 16. \n\nI was looking for a renter that was just a reliable payer and grateful that I take care things around the house (organizing, cleaning, dealing w landlord, repairs). My vibe is more like an AirBnB host or house manager than a roommate, tbh; I want everyone to feel at home, but I don't want anything dramatically changed as far as furniture, habits, or vibe. I also specifically screened for introverts.\n\nI chose roommate sight unseen, scent unsmelled, irl vibe unchecked, after a few FaceTime calls because they were moving from out of town.\n\nI have a very strong sensitivity to smells, and get migraines from scents easily. In the sublease I wrote in a caveat for this, prohibiting them. \"No scented candles, incense, or other scented sprays are permitted indoors. No open flames indoors nor on the deck.\" Before signing, we discussed this bulletpoint in-depth.\n\nThe house is a single-level old home, where you can hear noise and smell scents from the back of the house into the front of the house. It requires a high level of conscientiousness.\n\nMy main issues with the roommate are things that aren't \"bad\" objectively, but they're a bad match for me:\n\n* is a very clear extrovert with a loud voice, loud laugh, and social capacity of 1,000; I don't know how he duped me on video chat, as it's so very clear in person.\n* drinks coffee daily via stovetop Lavazza, so coffee smell fills entire house for \\~6 hours and wakes me up out of bed.\n* body odor is out of control bad; does not and will not wear deodorant.\n* uses many scented essential oils to cover up scents.\n* has burned incense in the common areas and in own bedroom multiple times; confirmed this via text so I have written attestation of breaking the lease.\n* is requiring receipts for all TP/cleaner/etc purchases before he will agree to pay utilities. I guess this is reasonable, but it's way more work for me, since I don't go to a one-stop shop, pay cash, and usually estimate stuff ($6 instead of $5.48, that kind of thing).\n\nWe have had multiple conversations about all of these bulletpoints. I have now consented to regular house meetings, a cleaning schedule, and itemizing receipts\u2014three things which were not necessary in the past, and that I would like to not be necessary in the future. I just want to live with a grown adult without drama and with a lot of conscientiousness.\n\nHow do I...\n\n* Let him know that I will be dissolving his sublease, in a compassionate way\n* ...that also makes sure he pays the upcoming 10/1 rent?\n* Note: I think I have to legally deliver notice via the USPS, but I have to time it so it doesn't arrive before I get to speak with him.\n\nI'm out of my depth here. And really hope I'm able to find someone to cover his rent in time for 11/1..."

Everything was packed into a 28L Jansport Everett weighing 1.225 lbs and measuring 17Lx11Wx11D (if you count the outside pockets) and a leather crossbody purse. When fully packed before the trip, the backpack weighed 12 lbs, and the purse could've fit in the backpack so, don't @ me, bro; it was just more convenient to carry it across my front like a sling.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fmvjlcsu1eo91.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0e8e2d65f83f81fff3ae14e73fcf083aecd89da4\n\nMy original plan was 18 days: 1 day flight, 3 nights ocean, 3 nights city, 3 nights farm, 4 nights city, 4 nights ocean, 1 day flight.\n\nDue to the farm stay being incredible, spraining my ankle, and flight delays causing missed connections, it ended up being 19 days: 1 day flight, 3 nights ocean, 3 nights city, 7 nights farm, 2 nights ocean, 2 nights city, 2 days flights.\n\nThe weather got as cool as 12\u00b0C/55\u00b0F and as hot as 32\u00b0C/90\u00b0F. It rained on day 3, day 7, day 12, and day 18. I participated in swimming, horseback riding, yoga, massage, hiking, cliff diving, and pasta making.\n\nI got access to laundry service on day 6, and hand washed on day 13. I would have had a hard time doing it more frequently due to the weather, lack of dryers in Italy, and frequency of travel, and thus don\u2019t at all regret any of the clothing or lingerie quantities. Especially after a bonfire on day 14 made near everything smell like smoke.\n\nEverything I packed:\n\n* 5 tops: 3 tanks, 1 one sleeve, 1 3/4 sleeve\n* 4 bottoms: 2 skirts, 1 shorts, 1 legging\n* 2 thin sleep tees\n* 1 3/4 sleeve cardigan\n* 1 long sleeve jumper/sweater\n* 1 pair skimmies/bloomers\n* 7 panties\n* 3 bras (including 1 sports bra)\n* 2 pairs socks\n* 3 shoes (trail sneakers, flat dress sandals, foam shower sandals)\n* 1 lightweight scarf\n* 4 hair flowers\n* 2 belts\n* 2 bikini tops, 1 bikini bottom\n* 1 quick dry towel\n* 1 mini umbrella\n* 1 phone stand\n* 1 med bag: 1 inhaler, 4 bandaids, 8 Tylenol, 8 Benadryl, 3 valium, 3 migraine meds, 6 anti nausea, 2 antiseptic wipes, 8 alcohol wipes, 1oz hand sanitizer, 1oz steroid cream, birth control\n* 1 toiletry bag: 1 2/3 used deodorant, 2 mini tubes toothpaste, toothbrush, 20 floss sachets, 1 mouthguard, 2oz conditioner, .5oz face wash, .3oz face cream, .3oz acne cream, 1 disposable razor, .5 oz texturizing dry shampoo, 1oz curl custard\n* 1 makeup bag: 1 mascara, 1 lipstick, 1oz tube BB cream, 1 concealer sample, 1 emery board, 10 curl clips, 20 bobby pins, 3 hair ties\n* 1 tweezer\n* 1 nail clipper\n* 1 brush\n* .5oz tube bug spray\n* 3oz sunscreen\n* 3 stain wipes\n* 3 makeup remover wipes\n* 2 pairs earplugs (1 regular, 1 silicone)\n* 1 jewelry bag: 4 necklaces, 5 earrings, 1 bracelet\n* 2 wrist braces (1 soft, 1 hard)\n* .3oz glasses cleaner spray + cloth\n* clip on sunglasses\n* 2 plug converters\n* 1 phone + charger\n* 1 iphone shuffle + charger\n* 1 ebook device\n* 2 headphones\n* 1 leather crossbody purse\n* 2 wallets (1 to leave at my stay, 1 to bring with me out)\n* 1 28L backpack\n* 1 5oz dollar store backpack\n* 1 lunchbox to use as packing cube\n* 6 compression sacks\n* 1 reusable grocery bag\n* 1 neck pillow\n* 1 journal\n* 1 pen\n* 1 paperback book\n\n**Things that got broken, lost, or given away:**\n\n* 1 pair socks (elastic died)\n* 1 pair headphone (ripped jack)\n* 1 5oz dollar store backpack (ripped)\n* 1 necklace pendant (lost at sea)\n* 1 long sleeve jumper (gave to a friend in need)\n* 1 paperback book (given to a friend)\n\n**Things I regret bringing:**\n\n* so many curl clips (though I might\u2019ve used them all on the originally planned trip)\n* one of my wallets; it could convert into a crossbody so I thought it\u2019d be useful, but could\u2019ve gotten away without it for sure\n* a leather purse instead of a bag that was lighter weight; but I didn't have one before leaving; now I have three... hahaha\n\n**Things I acquired:**\n\n* a sprained ankle, lol\n* ankle brace (sprained my ankle)\n* a drawstring mini backpack they put the accessories for my brace in\n* 2 scarves\n* 2 bag\n* 2 belts\n* 1 straw fedora (which I promptly left on the plane)\n* 1 souvenir calendar\n* 3oz herbal oil from the farmers\n* some postcards\n* some lucky charms\n* an extra hairtie\n* a replacement pair of headphones\n* 2 paperback books\n* more bug spray (mosquitoes on farm were killer)\n* splinter extraction ointment (due to my idiotically touching a prickly pear)\n\n**Things I didn\u2019t bring that I wish I would\u2019ve:**\n\n* Honestly, nothing. Maaaaybe shampoo, but it showed up a few times, and with the dry shampoo, I was fine, especially once I converted the trip to include a full week+ of farm life\n\nI waffled a LOT between backpack and roller, and opted to port my backpack because I expected to be walking up hundreds of stairs on day 1. It turned out this wasn\u2019t the case, and as a person with knee and back injuries, especially after I sprained my ankle, I would\u2019ve preferred the roller. Had I stayed in one place longer, it would\u2019ve been fine, but changing stays at the frequency I did, with morning check outs and unable to check-in until afternoon, the backpack really deterred me from walking around, which I would\u2019ve done happily with my roller. Also 12 lbs might\u2019ve felt different in a different backpack. Tips I got from r/HerOneBag for packing the weight higher up really helped with making it feel more manageable.\n\nHope my inordinate amount of details helps someone, and encourages you all to pack light!"

The patchwork is a little janky but it was the result of a great deal of willpower and an appalling amount of starch (the pieces, especially on the sleeves, were SO SMALL and warped like you wouldn't believe) but I like to think it's striking enough as a whole that no one will be looking at the spots where the corners don't match up. The quilting was all done by hand (which I kind of regret, because machine quilting would have stood out more) and about 3/4 of the seams were hand-finished.

                "body": "F23, I\u2019ve been taking Adderall (30 mg XR in the morning, 10 mg XR around noon) for about 14 years and Prozac (20 mg) for about 8. I have ADHD and a history of anxiety/depression (the latter is well-managed enough that it\u2019s rarely an issue anymore.) I live in new york state, which is relevant as well.\n\nI saw my pediatrician for meds until I aged out last year, when I switched over to the psychiatrist I\u2019m seeing now. According to her website she specializes in child/adolescent psychiatry, but she also sees young adult patients like me. I started seeing her last fall, and she seemed fine- I told her my medical history and explained what medications I take, and she was fine with prescribing them.\n\nEverything was pretty much normal until our appointment in late january. She said, pretty much out of nowhere, that she was concerned about my heart function being affected by the long term exposure to adderall. This seemed odd to me, because if she\u2019s so concerned about all that, why did she agree to prescribe it for so long? She told me that before our next appointment, I had to have an EKG, blood test (to check thyroid function, because she thought my anxiety symptoms might be linked to a thyroid issue- which was also weird, because, again, why did it take months for her to decide this was an issue?), and a urine drug screen. She didn\u2019t say outright that this was to fulfill state requirements, but she more or less implied that this was all a matter of due diligence- just a routine check. I managed to finagle a doctor\u2019s appointment on short notice, and I was able to get the EKG done, and I have a script for the other tests.\n\nThe following psych appointment was this morning. She asked how my concentration has been, and I said it was normal. That was about all I managed to say before she started saying that Adderall (or \u201cspeed\u201d, as she started to call it) is dangerous, and (in tones of grave concern) that I\u2019m on the highest possible dose- and that my name is flagged in pharmacy systems because of it. Then, she said that she\u2019s getting notifications that adderall is going to be banned in new york state, so she\u2019s going to have to switch me to another medication anyway. She\u2019s going to try 30 mg Ritalin LA and another 10mg later in the day- she warned me that this will mean I have to work on my time management, concentration, and sleep habits.\n\nMy time management, concentration, etc are already not great- I\u2019m just getting by, as far as those things are concerned. But she didn\u2019t know that because she never asked (or, if she did, I didn\u2019t get a chance to really explain myself before she started talking again). She also mentioned wanting to get my liver function checked in the bloodwork I\u2019m having done- which is not what I have a script for (she asked for a thyroid check, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m having done).\n\nAt the end of the appointment I did some research, and I can\u2019t find anything to corroborate what she said about adderall being banned soon. There\u2019s a shortage, sure, but I can\u2019t find anything beyond that.\n\nMy instinct is to get a second opinion, but I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll end up being a different person, but the same problems. There\u2019s also the fact that I\u2019m running out of Adderall, so the clock is ticking on finding someone who can prescribe it for me. I\u2019m open to switching medications if it\u2019s truly for the best, but I\u2019m hesitant to trust the word of someone who\u2019s so blatantly anti-adderall. I know it\u2019s a strong drug but it\u2019s worked well for me, and any time I\u2019ve gone off it, I struggled to function- so I\u2019ll need a damn good reason to switch to something else. \n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that she can seem awfully impersonal- it feels like every appointment she asks me where I go to school and what I\u2019m studying, and while I\u2019m sure she has a lot of patients, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to hope she would remember something about me, even if she has to check her notes to refresh her memory before the meeting.\n\nIn short, the whole thing struck me as terribly weird- it just didn\u2019t feel right. The mention of adderall being likely to be banned, and of my name being \u201cflagged\u201d, seemed especially odd, mostly because I can\u2019t find any proof that they\u2019re true; the sudden concern over a medication she\u2019d been okay with prescribing for months felt strange, too. This is the first psychiatrist I\u2019ve had, so I don\u2019t know exactly what to expect- I\u2019m interested to hear whether this sounds normal or not. I\u2019d appreciate any thoughts or suggestions about any of this!"

I can even write code matching the patterns of the original author to account for any context-specific changes they made that I'm not particularly aware of.  \nI have an exceptional \"big picture\" memory and can create accurate working models of a project's workflow and predict how different projects will intersect or interrupt each other in the future. This ability allows me to naturally identify what can be done to prevent anything terrible from happening.  \nI can't Leetcode for beans. If I do, it's a considerable effort and very slow. Even when I'm doing well, I'm not super fast at executing. In interviews, this does not present well, as it looks like inexperience to the untrained eye. It's not my primary mode of thinking or temperament. I'm more reflective, and the only thing that speeds me up is loads of caffeine (not great for anxiety in an interview).   \nIn terms of cognitive abilities in general, I think I'm around 142 regularly, including migraines, etc. (I get migraines from text anxiety - if I take an hour-long exam, after about 45 mins, I start to lose my recall and wordfinding abilities/migraine aphasia starts to kick in, as does blindness in one eye, pain, burning, etc. Under these conditions, I score around 142-ish. Without migraine and anxiety, it was much higher). Coding assessments are literally painful for me.  \n   \nI don't come from a CS background academically (BA from a top college in architecture), but the skills you've noted likely relate to spatial intelligence, which is not frequently taken into account when judging cognitive ability for jobs.  \n   \nI'm naturally a systems thinker, but there is no Leetcode that. Even system design interviews are a crapshoot, not because designing a system is difficult, but because communicating systems is difficult.  \nFrom what I've noticed, \"big picture\" folks can easily communicate with other \"big picture\" folks, and \"executors\" find it easier to understand other executors. It's easier for \"big picture\" folks to translate their 'big pictures' with practice, but I'm not so sure about the reverse.  \nAlso, given your high ability, you are almost expected to have underutilized capabilities. It's more common than not across people with high cognitive abilities. It's normal.  \nIt can be very jarring when you notice your deficits. Because your strengths are very strong, you likely have yet to encounter many situations requiring you to use those other abilities to grow them.  \nEven if the potential to grow those skills is limited, it's more common than not - even for programmers. They find workarounds and heuristics for making codebases navigable.",

If it\u2019s only labeled medically, it would need to be discussed in a way that necessitated medical intervention. \n\nIn my understanding, the DSM is explicitly for defining and identifying the conditions that require or suggest medical attention. Even in those cases, the conditions or each symptom exists on continuum. Only after interfering with a persons daily living is clinical intervention or a diagnosis necessary.\n\nTo have no term beyond a medical context would be extremely confusing for everyone involved.\n\nImagine people trying to discuss their differences - in order to put a name to what they\u2019re discussing, they would have to say something is medically wrong with them.

Background: I\u2019m mid-level software engineer currently interviewing for new roles.\nI\u2019m in possession of your typical gifted grab bag of traits - highly gifted, highly sensitive, highly anxious, etc. Personality-wise, if you\u2019re familiar with MBTI, I come across as a cross between an INTP and an ENFP maybe? (INFJ is the closest fit) - cheery but hyper-nerd 3000x.\n\nThose things on their own pose enough trouble as it is, but I\u2019ve run into people who can\u2019t seem to get past my appearance. It can be tough to pinpoint as it\u2019s happening, but I\u2019ve been told in interviews that I sound like I\u2019m in marketing or product development (I don\u2019t sound like an engineer - plausible, but I get my point across and it\u2019s never effected me on the job). It also happens when I ask a straightforward question with a concrete answer, and get a response to a simpler, very basic question (anyone with a quarter of my experience would be able to answer), and a comment about how I should know the answer (to the simple question I didn\u2019t ask, but do know the answer to). (Side note - sorry if that was too specific or rambling-last manager was hell). No problems with most engineers once on the job.\n\nI\u2019ve been told it\u2019s in my head, but even at my last job, I\u2019d have a staff engineer (most senior engineer) repeat my comments verbatim and get a valid response rather than a blank stare.\nWhen some people project their imagined persona onto me, that persona is not smart or an engineer. It does not match reality, and it\u2019s very frustrating for all involved. Other engineers were also confused.\n\nIn the words of my husband, I don\u2019t look smart - I \u201clook like I play a smart person on TV.\u201d That\u2019s with glasses. Without glasses, I normally look like a typical newscaster. I don\u2019t wear much makeup or do anything to stand out really (unless I\u2019m feeling a migraine coming on, in which case I look fabulous in big dark sunglasses and a baseball cap - my family members call it celeb incognito). I\u2019m also pretty peppy and relatively fashionable. \n\nOutwardly: I come across as a cross between Meghan Markle and Kerry Washington, with a kindergarten teacher vibe that wants to explain logical fallacies to children (nicely), while feeding them tasty, vegan/allergen-friendly cookies for brain food (omega 3-6-9 acids balanced by need, of course).\n\nAny tips? In my last role, I was basically told to be more assertive. Apparently, assertiveness fixes verbal comprehension. I don\u2019t think that would work in an interview setting."

I can't really find a good expression for this in Dutch. \"Goede reis\" literally means \"good travel\" but it sounds so light because it could also relate to a bike ride of 15 minutes. \"Vaarwel\" (farewell) would be fitting but it sounds archaic. Same for \"behouden reis/vaart\" (safe travels).\nMaybe \"tot ziens\" has a fitting connotation in Dutch. It means \"until we meet again\" so it has nothing to do with the travel but more with the company.\n\nAnyway I think it's a very nice gesture and they're lucky to have you as daughter-in-law :)",

This results in more chances for enemies both to escape or chase you and kill you. And don't forget about potential Jarvan ultimate on low cd! This may plague immobile champs like Evelynn, ESPECIALLY in the early game till 6. As far as I know, only Shaco feels himself nicely without flash or ghost in the jungle.\n2. **Monster Hunter debuff - absolutely atrocious here!** It is already pretty annoying in normal games (usually in force majeure situations). The problem about \"Ultimate spellbook\" is that this mode is very fast pacing, and \"Monster hunter\" debuff is very slow. **It lasts until 20 minutes and 20 minutes is usually the game end time!**\n\nI played 13 games. **All except one are in a range of 15-22 minutes length**. This means, more often than not, Monster hunter debuff will plague jungler till the end of the game. What does this mean? Simply speaking: **you can't solo push lanes**. **And avoid giving any buffs or crabs to allies at all costs!** Or you will lose plentiful of gold and exp.\n\nOut of those 13 games in probably 10 I lost a lot of gold due to this debuff (other 3 were just easy games, those not count). I just don't understand, I must sit in the jungle for the entire game? Ignore teamfights? Ignore towers? Is this what the game wants jungler to do, PVE in fast-pa\u0441ing fun game mode?\n\nPlease, tell me I'm not alone with this problem, this annoys me enormously, to the point I started playing mid instead of jungle, and that's when I ALWAYS played jungle\n\n(rank platinum 4, if that matters)\n\n**EDIT** *after few days*: after playing more games (\\~30 probably) I almost got used to it. Almost. But the pattern is, again: When games are \"balanced\" and slow - you can jungle and everyone is doing fine - \"monster hunter\" won't bother you. **If the game is fast-pacing** (constant fights emerge everywhere ) or goes out of your control - \"monster hunter\" will try to force you to jungle, basically ruining your already unstable game. And with all those ultimates fast games emerge very often.\n\nReally, I'm pushing a lane with Baron buff while receiving 4 gold from minions - like, wtf \ud83d\ude44\n\nAlso: game search was very unstable at start. I played against challenger Zed, I played against trio teamplay-gods, who chased me in both jungle sides... now it rarely happens, leading to calmer, farmy games. This has influence too"

Unity and Administrative capacity is combined in one building\n4. While biological ascension is the only one availible - it fits gameplay extremely well.\n5. Because of pt 2 and 3 - you don't have to waste building slots on processing buildings and can go straight for Research\\\\Unity\\\\Alloys\n6. That life tree origin gives even more free stats\n7. You don't have factions\n\nThis leads to gameplay features:\n\n1. Limited options (only bio ascension, life of tree origin, lesser building\\\\trait options, etc)\n2. Universalist (you can't pick Empire ethics, but it feels like you are the jack-of-all trades)\n3. Simple to play (limited options + no factions)\n4. Fast to progress (because of pop growth and easy building)\n\nBecause of all that direct bonuses, it's easy to go ahead of everyone very early into the game (for tech and unity, definitely feels so)\n\n**THE QUESTION:**\n\nAre there any minuses for playing hive mind? Universal, simple, strong... For casual playing its feels pretty all-mighty, i wonder what minuses there might be at more competetive gaming.\n\n*\\_In comparison\\_:*\n\nHad Hive mind game, on the next one played Lithoids, who are like the complete opposite in gameplay. Was shocked how much harder, weaker those rocks feel.\n\nPlayed peaceful fanatic Materialist\\\\Egalitarian on relic world origin. Did migration with other lithoids near (but not with normal empires, because what's the point in Lithoids then?) + rushed robots + colonised everything asap. For a big chunk of the game i was doing my best to just simply balance my resources to being in a plus. Was basically waiting for pops to grow and new build slots to appear. That's while my hive mind friend was Overwhelming at Might ant Tech while playing without much effort\n\nSo, am i missiong something? Or are Hive minds easy and strong, while something like Lithoids is hard and weak?"

The controversy surrounding the Islamic faith is that it has many different interpretations and practices. Some people believe that Islam is a benevolent religion that promotes peace, while others believe that Islam promotes hatred and violence. If we were to look at the world through an alternate lens, what if Islam was no longer a prominent religion? How would the world be different?\n\nIn a world without Islam, people would no longer have to hide their beliefs. People would no longer have to lie about their religion if they wanted to date or marry someone from another religion. People would no longer feel obligated to cover their bodies when they are naked. Furthermore, schools would no longer teach children to fear, hate, and subdue those who are different from them. Many lives would be much more comfortable and peaceful without religious undertones.\n\nSince Christianity is one of the major religions in the world, it's important to consider what would happen if everyone stopped believing in Jesus Christ. Many people believe in Christianity, and it's one of the two largest religions in the world. It's also the religion that most people associate with politics- so this change would affect a lot of people at both ends of the economics spectrum. Many political leaders would no longer be able to get support by using religion as an excuse for unfair policies.\n\nMany Muslim countries became non-Muslim after WWII due gold from them; now they're Muslim free zones. If everyone stopped following Islam, there would be no reason for these countries to be stuck in a time loop where they're Muslim again. This means there would be no more suicide bombers or wars over holy land. It would be refreshing for these countries to stop being stuck in a time loop where they're Muslim again!\n\nEveryone should work towards making the world better by ending atrocities committed in the name of religion. If everyone stopped following Islam, many lives would be made much safer and more comfortable. Additionally, Christianity would lose its prominence if everyone stopped believing in Jesus Christ. Although this concept is hard to grasp, it's something we should work towards achieving!\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to say the least"

I take care of most of my Mom's needs at home. \n\nShe has 3 other daughters. One sister (49) regularly helps my mother with transportation to appointments since I work full-time during the day and my sister works at night. We are her caretakers. My mom put me and this sister on her checking account as joint owners.\n\nThe other two sisters (37 & 53) aren't around often. The 37 year old has traveled to our city from 10 hours away, where she lives, and has left before coming to see our mother. She plans to do it again this month again when she comes back for a wedding. (She said she'd see her at the end of the month when she comes back again.)\n\nMy mother has all four of her daughters as receiving a payout on her life insurance. On her annuity, she has just the two of us (39 & 49) as payees. We also have access to the bank account. She says that since we're joint owners and her regular caretakers, that money would be ours to split. \n\nI want her to write a will stating what she wants so it's clear to everyone. She thinks that us being joint owners would be the end of it. I think it gives us access to the money, but my other sisters could contest it in court. They could argue that being joint owners would be to help her while she is alive and   they all have a claim to it after death. \n\nMy mother says it's none of their business because they're not here. That's nice to say, but they will have issues and I want to avoid any unnecessary issues. \n\nDoes the fact that we're joint owners of the bank account mean that we have exclusive rights to it if our mother passes away, or is a will needed to solidify that?"

                "body": "Hi, I\u2019ve been studying astrology for a few years now. Ascendant signs have always been of particular interest to me. I can often guess people\u2019s rising signs fairly easily and it\u2019s a fun little game. Often in these types of forums, people will make posts asking \u201cwhich rising sign is the most attractive. But I think they all beautiful are in they\u2019re own unique way. It\u2019s really fascinating to me how two Libra risings will have a similar overall \u201cflavor\u201d to them, even if they have completely different styles. So here\u2019s my list of rising signs and my take on what type of beauty they have. These traits are what I\u2019ve observed in feminine people. But feel free to discuss, agree, disagree and add. :)\n\nAries rising: \nBold beauty, Aries rising takes what they want. They\u2019re not afraid to be risky and do something out of left field with their hair like cut it really short or wear things that are very eye catching or bold. They like to shock people. Very friendly and confident which makes Aries risings super hot. (Shakira, Rihanna, Kendall Jenner)\n\nPisces rising:  \nUnique and flexible, ethereal, youthful Pisces rising traits are pretty unique to the individual. I believe they take on the look and characteristics of their sun sign  and just kind of blend the soft and easygoing nature of Pisces with their sun sign. As pointed out in a reply, many will have deep water like eyes. I believe any color eyes can have a water like abyss quality to them, even if they\u2019re not a clear blue. Many water dominant and water element risings can appear spacey or somewhere else in their eyes. (Whitney Houston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Demi Moore, Billie Elish)\n\nTaurus rising: \nGlamorous, curves for days or just undeniable beauty. They ooze luxury quality and sensuality. Then they speak or sing and it\u2019s like being wrapped up in a warm fuzzy blanket (Gigi Hadid, Ruby Rose)\n\nGemini rising: \nCute and animated,gemini risings have spunk. They are socially active and great at conversation, both as the listener and speaker. They know how to make people like them and they don\u2019t have to try hard at all. They are smiley and upbeat which makes them radiant. ( Sarah Jessica Parker, Sandra Bullock, Lady Gaga)\n\nCancer rising: \nsoft, a little bit mysterious, cancer risings are layered. They do not always show their nurturing creative side to strangers. They are cautious and even a little shy at first. The hidden depth and vulnerability rumbling beneath the surface makes them so beautiful. (Cameron Diaz, Angelina Jolie, Liv Tyler)\n\nLeo rising: \nExotic, regal or just eye catching. No one can ignore a Leo rising. They walk tall and always look their best. Because life is a stage. This is my rising sign, so I\u2019m a little biased. But I have met and looked at a lot of Leo risings and from the men to the women they are usually very attractive in a animalistic way. The air of confidence makes them literally glow, even while wearing dark clothing. ( Emma Stone, Selena Gomez, Nicole Richie)\n\nVirgo rising: \nClassic, clean, put together, Virgo risings look like they take care of themselves and their things. They walk and sit with great posture and have a dainty elegance about them.\n (Nicole Scherzinger, Christina Ricci, Emma Watson)\n\nLibra rising: \ngirl next door classically good looking, Libra risings feel familiar. They look approachable, friendly and the usually are. They smile a lot and are good listeners. Beautiful, well formed people. There is no denying a Libra rising is pretty.  (Britney Spears, Beyonc\u00e9, Jennifer Aniston)\n\nScorpio rising: \nStriking, something about them says, \u201cI can take over this room with one sentence.\u201d They ooze power. Their presence never has a neutral reaction. You either love them or hate them. Super sexy. I find Scorpio ascendant are particularly sultry demeanor and/or appearance from a young age and have old souls. Remember Natalie Portman in \u201cThe professional\u201d?\n(Natalie Portman, Katherine Hepburn,Katy Perry)\n\nSagittarius rising: \nLively, confident. People gravitate toward sag risings and everyone wants to be their friend. They are always on their way to do something interesting or fun and that\u2019s attractive. Also tend to have shapely rear ends or long legs. (Kim Kardashian, Scarlett Johansson, Jennifer Lawrence )\n\nCapricorn rising: \nCapricorn risings are ageless. They look both young and mature at the same time and rock vintage looks in a very classy and natural way. High contrast features that can easily get them confused with a Scorpio rising. Let me know if you can add to this one, some of these are tough to define.(Zooey deshannel, Kylie Jenner, Taylor Swift)\n\nAquarius rising: \nquirky, unique, smart, aqua risings are unapologetically themselves. Many of them have a bit of a weirdness about them that is pretty cool; mannerisms that would be awkward if they didn\u2019t commit so fiercely to them.They dress funky and for no one but themselves. This can be said for aqua moons and sun as well I\u2019ve noticed. (Zendaya, Audrey Hepburn, Elle Fanning)"

(pun may be intended)\n\n2) Also why does he lock his door everytime, even pre-death note? Is that explainable by his teenage behaviour plainly wanting privacy? Or is he \"emotionally detached\" from his family for quite a long time?\n\n3) Now this is what I'm fazed about. He said he was bored for some time in the 1st episode. Why didn't he take up sports, hobbies, clubs, competitions? (He could win some comps right)"

Correct me if I'm wrong. So does that mean that Teru Mikami can see Light's name in the end? He didn't write it down because he considered Light as a God and thought that the notebook is real, so he didn't write Light's name in fear that Kira will die?!<"

It really opened my eyes to how little support these shelters receive due to a lot of the social conceptions we have here (such as viewing breeds as much better than kelab baladi, temporarily buying pets then abandoning them when they become inconvenient, the idea animals aren\u2019t worth helping when there are people suffering). Dr Noha (the person who runs the shelter) is an extremely kind and hard-working person who really gives her all into helping these pets. Running a rescue shelter is not cheap, especially when many of the animals they take in are severely injured and rarely adopted. If anyone would like to help in any way shape or form (donating, raising awareness, volunteering, adopting, fostering etc\u2026) you can contact the shelter on their instagram in the link above. \n\nThank you for your time!"

For the recommendation choose one of the methods, justify it not by just repeating your above points but by explaining why it\u2019s better than the other 2 methods in the context of the business (again application needs to be consistent throughout). \n\nhope this helps but this is what i\u2019ve gathered from mark schemes and my teacher :)\n Also!: read the case study carefully and make sure to underline the key facts/ information you could use, even annotate it if it helps\n\nEdit: this may be a bit late but here you can see examiners commenting on past answers including how they could've improved them so for any of you doing variant 1 skim through this https://myeducite.com/uploads/0450_Example_Candidate_Responses_Paper_2.pdf"

Just gonna lead with that. \n\nI figured it was a possibility that I lost her, but she was my best bet. \n\nI STILL don\u2019t know if these two ONLY know Energy Ball? No one has said if they have Confusion, so leading Monferno felt too wrong. I thought Staravia might also be too frail for double Confusion and didn\u2019t want to risk it with the grass gym close by. \n\nBut anyway, all that aside, a lot of things had to go wrong for Luxio to die here, and they all did. \n\n1. Luxio had to not outspeed the Abra. I\u2019m especially salt because she outsped one but KO\u2019d the wrong one. \n\n2. They had to double into her. Neither one targeted the oh-so-useless Chansey. Worse than useless, since the AI never targeted her. \n\n3. Either could have crit, which thankfully didn\u2019t happen. \n\n4. ONLY THE FASTER ONE could have gotten the SpDef drop and affected the fight. So of course it did. \n\nSo that\u2019s, at my most generous, losing a coin flip times a 30 percent chance, with an extra 12.5% chance tacked on for at least one to crit. That\u2019s assuming the AI is also good enough to never hit Chansey. Divide this figure by 4 if it\u2019s not. \n\n27.5 percent. Horrible. It\u2019s a pretty big risk, I guess, and her SpDef down Nature didn\u2019t help. But I\u2019ve been doing Nuzlockes for almost a decade now and this might be unparalleled salt from just how close it was to NOT happening, four or five different ways. \n\nBasically the AI turned what I thought was a 6.25% chance, into a 27.5% chance. I\u2019ll have to give this new AI some credit for being at least a little bit good. \n\nAnd can somebody please confirm that these Abra do NOT in fact also know Confusion? Just so maybe someone more fortunate can save their good thundercat? \n\nThanks for listening to the vent. Hopefully at least one person is helped out by it."

Maybe he\u2019s still soft because he only bent one marvelous articulation out of joint, or knocked a cog out of place, instead of tearing the voice box out or smashing the toy entirely. \n\nThere\u2019s a girl who puts her own toy on the shelf when no parent told her that she should. If anything, the parents demand she take it out to be broken. \n\nThere\u2019s a girl who exhausts herself defending her marvelous toy, who can never cease their vigil. \n\nThere\u2019s a girl who mostly guards what\u2019s hers, who learns the craft of the toys, who repairs what\u2019s broken, with varying degrees of success. \n\nThere\u2019s a boy who helps her, but always under cover of darkness. \n\nThere\u2019s a boy and a girl who cut a deal and proceed to spend the rest of their lives insisting they didn\u2019t. \n\nThere\u2019s a girl with her voice box torn out, whose limbs and eyes and heart are all shattered. \n\nThere are girls who play with girls, and boys who play with boys, and some children who don\u2019t seem to care what the clockwork marvel is, as long as the other player is a friend.

It\u2019s not worth the trouble, they say, and life has other things in it. And they\u2019re right, of course, but some of us still want a new toy very badly and it hurts to see them offered only to those who have already said no. \n\nThere\u2019s an individual who delights in collecting toys, and she is on constant high alert, but he loves to share, too. They are everything, and their ability to share toys with so much generosity soothes others in his or her life who have felt their toy was too broken, or too scarce, or not quite right.\n\nAnd then there I am, struggling to craft a new masterwork out of found objects and the busted-up first draft\u2026 maybe even more than one. It\u2019s a mess right now, but it\u2019s going to be an even more marvelous invention than any this world has yet seen.\n\nAnd then there you all are, patching and welding and soldering and fixing it all, no matter how many times our saboteurs mortar the shop. \n\nWe are kinder men, stronger women, happier thems and shinier rebels than anyone who ever decided that the only two choices were break, or be broken."

HOURS. \n\n\nI grew to love my whole team, and felt such high highs and low lows\u2026 but goddamn, y\u2019all, I\u2019ve been playing this run since January and it\u2019s finally over. \n\nAlola, despite being a hard game, deserves to feel like a lower-stakes run. \n\nThere will still be many restrictions, normal hardcore ruleset, level cap, all of that. There will even be a set of teambuilding restrictions I\u2019m enforcing. Diversity beyond just roles and type. This time it\u2019s Egg Group. (Sorry, Field. One at a time, please.) \n\nBut at the same time, the game will get to BREATHE. No calcs. No looking things up. It helps that the game isn\u2019t new to me, but I never Locked it successfully before. \n\nBetween pinch berries and malasadas, much attention will be paid to Natures, not just for viability but for their best care and satisfaction. \n\nThe blessings of nature are all around. Enjoy food, fashion, surfing, and every Center\u2019s famous Tapu Cocoa. \n\nEmbrace the unique region! Z-Moves are fun, super-effective just makes sense to always be using, and even SOS chaining is on the table. (Mostly just to try and get Mareanie, LOL.) \n\nRegional variants and new mon are a must. I\u2019ll be soaking up the sun, and enjoying some of the goofier choices we have.

One of the group told us how much he hated women, he said that they  are all superficial and brainless. It was kinda hurtful for me. The doctor asked us if we had any romantic stories to share and I told her that I have a boyfriend, and one of them told the others that girls who had boyfriends at my age are whores. I talked about it with the doctor and she told me that I shouldn\u2019t blame them because I\u2019m the first girl in the group  but I\u2019m just tired of this sexism. I also noticed sexism in all the aspie forum I visited. A guy who thought that I was a man told me that girls are evil and manipulative. I feel left apart in my own community, do other girls with Asperger feel the same?"

However, all the girls are faking to feel sick, and this is a big obstacle because faked symptoms are going to make impossible to know how to treat the illness and its effects, so he and the school nurse are on a quest to find out who's healthy and who's faking.\n\nThe result? A borefest.\n\nBy now, on AIDungeon, one of the girls would have turned into a werewolf, another attacked by a demon. The nurse would have gone insane and killed the doctor, and then slept with his dead body. I'm not kidding.\n\nWhen I tried this scenario in AIDungeon it involved a magic lamp with a genie with its own magic lamp that used the second genie to grant people the wishes she agreed with. I found that to be a very creative concept I hadn't seen before, and shortly after the world was to be destroyed and the genie didn't want to help.\n\nTHINGS ESCALATED QUICKLY\n\nHere, the \"ink well ran dry\" asking me to create an account.

In American culture an example is words like \"frickin'\", they're used instead of \"bad words\", but I make you evoke the bad word in your mind.\n\nOr \"n word\", which makes you evoke a certain word in your mind, even though there's thousands of possible n words, only one, the worst one, comes to mind.\n\nSo after all this that has happened, AIDungeon evokes child abuse. This is brand-killing, because if drinking cola evoked it, or fast food hamburgers evoked it, or driving a car evoked it, brands like Coca-Cola, McDonald's or Ford would have gone extinct long ago.\n\nIt has gotten so bad that if you search for AIDungeon on  Google, the words \"sexual content that may involve depictions/descriptions of minors\" appear near the top. This thing now features on the top results, it's what is evoked prominently now, even to non-players.\n\nBefore:\n\nOnly people producing such content got to think about it.\n\nNow:\n\nEveryone gets to think about it.\n\nThe devs don't even realize they're doing it backwards by exposing the concept.\n\nI can deal with the censorship (which I expected to be there before I started playing anyway), I can accept that my data got leaked for everyone to see, who cares (about MY stories).\n\nBut thinking about child abuse every time I visit this sub?

And when considering Chinese Ammunition development from 1980 I wouldn't be surprised if the APFSDS is quite bad actually in both pen and spalling. And if it's only a steel core it's angle pen will be abysmal. Only the devserver will tell how good/bad the APFSDS will actually be though.",

They produced like one tank for exhibition but the rest of their tanks were Urals, M and M1 (Although the M1 were the rarest) and the M1 are essentially identical to a T-72A.\n\nAnd the Ural and M were apparently the most numerous and they also had the 3BM17 as their best ammunition that couldn't even penetrate other T-72s, which made their tanks useless against the American Abrams tanks. They're still not comparable to the T-72s fighting in Ukraine though, simply due to the ammunition and the modifications of both the Russians, Ukrainians and western Nations that sent their T-72s to Ukraine.",

                "body": "I have noticed over the past year(s) that wehenever I play something below the Br ranges of these missiles, or when playing whatever was the top Br, I never really had problems with CAS. In toptier you have missile AA that counters Anti-Ground Missiles while the CAS still has a chance to kill you, in lowtier all you need is an AA that can shoot further than 1.5km and you can defend yourself against planes.  \n\n\nFrom 7.0 to 9.7 however you can barely do anything against Planes that use Air-Ground Missiles. I include 7.0 because of the SK60) I have had multiple times where G91, A4-E or FJ-4Bs reliably killed tanks from 4km away while the AA could do nothing against that and people just quitting after their 1st or second death to a plane either because they know they have no chance or because they have been killed that way the last 10 matches and don't want to go through it again.  \n\n\nI have played the US, Germany, USSR, Britain, Italy and China at said Br range, and the only times I had fun were, when both Germany, Italy and/or the US were on my team or when they didn't bring Missile CAS when in the enemy team. Those were also the matches that my team generally didn't leave after the 1st death.\n\nIn every other match it was basically just, get 1-2 kills, die either 60% to CAS or 40% enemy tank, respawn, 80% die to Spawncamping CAS or 20% actually drive off while beeing terrified of the jet noise while looking at the sky in a terrified manner, only to then either 80% die to CAS (because the enemy at that point has like 4-5 planes up) or get killed by some light tank or leopard that is behind you and that you didn't notice because of the fear of planes. What then follows is most of the time this:\n\n\\>Spawn AA\n\n\\>try to hit plane\n\n\\>plane so far away radar won't even lock\n\n\\>plane comes near enough for radar to show lead\n\n\\>plane fires Missile that kills you even though it hit 30m away\n\n\\>shots you fired obviously didn't hit because plane did le' roll\n\n\\>look at map and see 4 people around your spawn\n\n\\>do one last spawn to heroically kill a tank before spawnprotection goes away and CAS gets 10th kill for the game\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter explaining all that, my solution would either be, a dynamic Br through which every plane with NORD, Bullpub or similar missiles that has these equipped gets auto-put at 9.7 but only in ground rb, or you are not allowed to spawn planes with these missiles when matches at maximum 9.7 or below.\n\nI would like to know what your thoughs are on this and if my observation is false."

Then I tried my Mi-24D, the ATGMs there are extremely hard to aim and also almost go into the ground. Then the Allouette and there the ATGMs are also behaving weirdly.

                "body": "First of all I want to say what results I already had and why I am confused. Since 2 months I do the 16 personalities test every week and I either get INTJ or INTP and when seeing one describing themselves I can always relate to them, no matter if INTP or INTJ\n\nLets get to the Questions then:\n\n \n\n* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n   * I am 15 Years old and male. Generally I am very quiet and shy when it comes to other people, especially if I don't know them. I also often find myself daydreaming about how to improve the things I see.\n* Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?\n   * No, there is no such diagnosis, although I have noticed that I show slight sings of Autism and Asperger but I have no direct diagnosis on those, so I wouldn't count on that.\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n   * It had no religions in it whatsoever, I guess I am one of the most atheist people you can find. But growing up in former eastern Germany with parents from there I learned really quick to be structured. If there are rules, I always make sure to not brake them and I am always confused if people break rules on purpose.\n* What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n   * I don't have a job but I am probably going to go into the direction of programming.\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n   * I would feel really refreshed, I would probably just sit in front of my PC and enjoy the silence and think about politics and economy. I almost never feel lonely, only on rare occasions.\n* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage i?\n   * I actually hate sports and outdoors events, the only ones I do like to see are races with motorbikes or cars. Normally my favorite activities are playing strategy games, racing games and very few PvP games (not this CoD kind of stuff)\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n   * I am curious about basically anything that has something to do with politics and science. I have way more ideas than I can execute, mostly because these ideas are way to big and involve global politics on a huge level. My Ideas are rather conceptional. For an example I often create concepts of what would happen if a certain event wouldn't have taken place or I think about how to improve something and often rebuild it in my head from the ground up.\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n   * I don't want to be in a leadership position as I am not good at giving commands, but if I really had to it would probably be in the form of getting people that are experts of certain areas to my side to help me make decisions that won't have a negative effect.\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n   * I don't think that I am that coordinated, my head is loaded with theories and plans about all kinds of things but as soon as I start something I loose interest in it as I cannot really coordinate my actions the way they need to be.\n* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n   * I am not really artistic and don't enjoy art that much either. If someone shows me modern art I am always confused on how you could call that art. I mostly find symmetrical things nice, like those old eastern block cities with whole symmetric city districts. Or anything else that is symmetric.\n* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n   * When it comes to the past I only have those what if theories but that is basically it as it is clear that we can't change what has already happened. For present, I think that we have to focus on what is currently not working and try to fix it. And at last for the future, I think that we should plan ahead and try to make those plans as perfect as possible to not have many problems in the future.\n* How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n   * I would ask what exactly I have to do and if I know that I am capable of doing it I help that person. But it depends on if I like that person or not. If I don't know that person I help because, you never know if you meet them again and will need their help. And generally I help people so that after that I can avoid discussions on why I refused to help.\n* Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n   * Yes, I need a lot of it, if I see someone doing something that is illogical to me I am always confused on why they would do that and I always want to figure out their motive and why they do that. Because I want to understand other peoples logic.\n* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n   * It is really important, if I see an inefficient system I have the urge to change it, and if I am unable to I am always frustrated. And for productivity, I always want to be as productive as possible but most of the time my procrastination prevents me from doing so which also makes me frustrated.\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n   * I don't know if I control others, I sometimes have the feeling I do it but I am never sure of it. I don't want to control other people though as forcing someone to do something will only make them do it less efficient.\n* What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n   * My hobby is gaming and I really like it, I can play games that are about my personal interests and mostly widen my knowlege. I have noticed that when my friend asks me about a tank in a certain game, 90% of the time I can give him a detailed explanation of it.\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n   * My learning style is using the things I learn in activities that involve my interests. I really struggle with learning environments where I just get put in front of a book and then have to learn the things in there 1:1. I have to explain things in my own words or else it won't work. I prefer classes using logic as logic can be applied to anything.\n* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n   * When I have a project I always split it into many small projects that evolve into a big one so that when I work on one of the small projects I don't feel like it would take ages to finish so I stay motivated. I only improvise if the project doesn't go as planned. And even then I create a plan for that improvisation.\n* What's important to you and why?\n   * For me rationality, logic and efficiency are the most important things and these are the things that create progress. If you are irrational you can make decisions that will have a big negative impact, if you are illogical the outcome will not be what you actually wanted and if you are inefficient it will take ages for something to complete or you will waste too much resources on things that need way less resources.\n* What are your aspirations?\n   * I generally just want to uncover the secrets of this world and make it more efficient, even though I probably won't be able to do that it is still what drives me forward.\n* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n   * My fears are: an unsuccessfull career, unknown locations, unpredictable people\n   * Smalltalk with other people makes me extremely uncomfortable, especially if it is a person I am interested in.\n   * I not only find smalltalk uncomfortable, I hate it. I also hate irrational people who clearly make decisions based on their advantage and on the disadvantage of the majority. I also really hate arrogance and people who are unable to accept criticism.\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n   * These are when I accomplished something I really wanted to accomplish, like my moped drivers license or a really good grades in school.\n* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n   * These are when I get forced to go onto social events like a school party where every student has to come. It is especially low if many people talk to me. Another low is when a person I am interested in is gone (Moved to another city, changed school) as I mostly don't really have contact with them as I am way to shy to talk to them.\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n   * I often daydream, but depending on the situation I daydream unaware of my surroundings and sometimes my surroundings are heavily involved in my daydreaming.\n* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n   * I would think about how I go there and how I could get out of there. If that won't work I think about how I can survive in there as long as possible. After I figured that out I think about what would be if I wan't in there and after that I again think about politics.\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n   * I need a lot of time to make an important decision, sometimes it takes up to half a year. Mostly I don't change my mind as I also create plans while I make my decisions and by changing it, it would mess over my plan.\n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n   * I don't need that long, mostly I keep my emotions to myself and I see them as rather annoying as sometimes they hinder me at being rational. I don't see them as important as I want to focus on other things than my emotions.\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n   * Never, I always stay with my point if the opposing person doesn't have a good argument.\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n   * I always try to not break any rules as that would only get me in unnecessary trouble. When it comes to challenging authority I would often like to do that as I often see many flaws in the things they do but rules are rules. If I want to challenge them I always try to use the rules to my advantage.\n* What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n   * My ideal life would be a life where I had only 1-2 really close friends that I could talk with about anything. My house would be next to a river, which is in a forest that is in a valley. Without any other houses around. I don't really know if I would have a wife or not, if so then it is one that thinks almost exactly like me and that accepts that I often want to be alone (I would accept it if she would act the same) and I would probably work from home at my computer. I would only go into town once a week to buy food. Just a nice and quiet life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this description is enough, I can (if I find out how) add a screenshot from my results of a personality test and sorry if my English is bad, as I am from Germany and English is only my 2nd language."

                "body": "The most holistic way to sum it up is that it broke me.\n\nHie, this is my first time posting and I'm not exactly sure if this fits here but I wanted to discuss a pattern in my life and how it relates specifically to my first real romantic relationship the subsequent break up and the transformation of myself.\n\nContext:\n\nOkay so to give some context before I speak about this break up I'll give some information about myself that is pertinent. \n\nI grew up on a farm, quite far away from a town in Zim. On this farm life felt very real and I felt connected. I experienced a lot in terms of dreams and deja vu like experiences of reality. Sometimes my experiences of reality were dreamlike, surreal.\n\nMy parents had a divorce when I was 5. My mom left the country and left me behind. My dad left shortly after. I was raised by my dads sister and his mom. That's whom I stayed with on the farm.\n\nAll this far stuff was until I was 13 and I moved to RSA for the first time that move felt like an epic journey big life changing period. Nothing changed how I expected but man did things change.\n\n--end of context.\n\n\n\nOkay now to get onto what I'm really here for. So before I got to RSA I used to be very in touch or merged with my sleeping dreams to the point were when I was awake I was half dreaming at the same time. Life was this mixture of dream and reality. All pre 14 years of age. I didn't really make friends and was always somewhat removed and distance from all my peers though I wasn't really stunted socially, I just grew somewhat divergent-like from my peers.\n\nI suppose this was caused by my parents spilt and subsequent disappearance. I've dubbed that experience the fall from heaven or the break from grace. That experience put me in touch with grief, anger, betrayal (rejection) and abandonment (disconnect). The first big jading experience. (Sidenote for a long time after this I've always been at odds with religion particularly Christianity which I was raised a part of. I always felt rejected or neglected by God after that. I'm not Christian anymore, haven't been for some years).\n\nSo I move to RSA and I'm terrified but also hopeful. I have one big mission - conscious mission - being driven by an even bigger unconscious one (I didn't know this at the time.) The big conscious mission was to Make friends and be accepted socially but also adapt to my environment. The unconscious one was this desire to earn my way back into paradise whatever that means. \n\nI do a good job of it, I make some friends, get involved with the student leadership, get involved with the sports. All well but were I was lacking was the romantic relationship Department (at this point I'm about 15).\nWhat then occurs is that I meet this girl. 1 - 2 months older than me and i fall for her hard.\nI start becoming something I didn't know myself to be. \n\n- self sacrificial\n- entertaining to be around (my whole life people had described me as deep and kind of somber. Someone even said it felt like I was carrying a great burden on my shoulders)\n- expressly affectionate (I'm usually more functionally affectionate)\n\nThis girl becomes a sort of beacon In my life, a light and I'll admit i got a bit over zealous about her. I'm sure it bleed out in my actions (I'm normally a self contained person so great passions aren't common for me -at least externally).\n\nDuring my time with her my entire experience of reality became bliss. The wounding I had from childhood with my parents seemed nonexistent and even my dreams took a pleasant turn. I woke up everyday tasting the joy of goodness.\n\nBut then one day she broke up with me - abruptly  or unexpectedly. She called me and told me her mom was sick with cancer and she didn't want me to have to deal with it (we dated for 7 months give or take so I'm about 16 at this point). What else do I do but accept what she says to me. It's evidently an awful situation to be in. (Turns out she lied. Her mom wasn't sick and she had another guy waiting for her. The week she broke up with me she was already coupled up with this new guy.)\n\nAnyway the point is she broke up with me. My world shattered for a second time but what I never expected is all the feelings from when my parents left to also resonate with that moment. It was like I was attacked the pain I felt consumed me and I remember I blacked out.\n\nWhen I woke up there was this mass of tension both of past and present. Unresolved and racing through my body simultaneously exploding. I was in agony.\n\nI remember the conversation I had with myself the instructions I gave myself.\n\n1. You are no longer allowed to become attached to anything.\n2. Feelings are a direct path to pain  rejection, abandonment, betrayal all that juicy stuff.\n3. I was going to be numb and remain unaffected. \n\n\n(At this time I was also discovering MBTI for all that's worth before I typed as an introverted intuitive feeling type. Months after this break up it changed to introverted intuitive thinking, which persists to this day).\n\n\nI became:\n\nDepressed\n\nI stopped remembering my dreams, experiencing a complete unawareness of them. Reality became grey emotionally and everything became bland. I tend to have a mix of sensory impressions. My taste sometimes connects to my eyes, or my ears etc. Well everything tasted bland and gross.\n\nI think the thing that really did stand out to me is I stopped dreaming or what felt like it. I was also posessed by grief, mistrust and separateness.\n\nI only recovered from this two years after.\n\n---(Sorry if this isn't in an order that makes sense. I type/[write?] how I think.)\n\n\n\nOkay that ended up being long and it's a bit confused and convoluted but if you made it his far thanks and well done.\n\nThe question I want to ask is this. \"If I'm noticing a pattern in my life the fact that I remember my past emotionally and more specifically narratively and that reflecting on it brings up dreams filled with \n\n1. Me in different scenarios as different masculine entities completing feats of competence, from mountain climbing, pioneering in the wildness , being an assassin, being a magician and a perpetual student plus \n\n2. Dreams of feminine entities oscillating from dominating me sexually to embodying qualities I don't always consciously value but I'm very moved to admiration by when I dream \n\nWhat does it mean.\n\n\nThis ended up being a mess. I'm going to sleep and try fix it up tomorrow. I also understand if nobody has anything to say.\n\nI'm not exactly clear on much myself rn. Feels like my mind is a swamp and I'm trying to clear it or renovate, idk if people renovate swamps."

In addition to this I want to find ways of therapy that pertain to the behavioral aspect that teach skills and behavioral issues such as inattentiveness that is NOT CBT or ABA as those would not be as effective I feel. Besides clinical behavioral therapy which is more for kids it is like adults are forgotten or they expect adhd to \"wear off.\" besides meds.. That is all I have."

Sure, I occasionally play and enjoy others like Gunfire Reborn, Slay the Spire, Risk of Rain 2 or Enter the Gungeon, but nothing quite hits the same as Isaac. May have something to do with the fact that Wrath of the Lamb was the first game I bought on Steam and played on my shitty old PC. Also the lore and religious themes play a huge part in my interest and enjoyment of the game. If that lore aspect wasn't there I'm sure I probably wouldn't have given it as much attention as I do. So, yeah Isaac has it's issues, definitely, it's far from a perfect game, but to call it poorly designed and lazy is just incorrect in my eyes. It's just not for everyone.",

The first thing that was weird, is that he gave me a diagnosis at our first session basically 10min into the conversation. Like, yes I have made intense research about dpdr for years(there isn't that much research done sadly) and described my symptoms in \"professional\" terms. But a certain diagnosis after 10min without any testing? \nHe also told me that there's no medication or therapy specifically for dpdr, which I already know. So I asked him about the causes of it to which he replied that there are none and \"some brains are just that way\". That was the second major thing that weirded me out. You can look up almost any source on dpdr and it will list things like anxiety disorders, depression, panic attacks, autistic sensory overload, epilepsy etc. as possible causes/comorbid disorders. I didn't say anything to correct him bc I was too overwhelmed in that moment. \nAt the end of the session he referred me to a radiologist to do an mrt of my brain and an eeg to rule out physical causes.\nIn conclusion:I'm super frustrated that I, the patient have to be the one to educate mental health professionalists on my disorder. This disorder worsens my quality of life so much and I don't know how much longer I can stand it."

This is my first-time using AA so forgive me if this has always been a thing, but I typically use Bluetooth when driving and that puts all sounds from the device under one volume channel. Is there really no way to do this in AA?",

While it may not have been the initial/original idea the reality is that from what one reads in Ruin and Memory that the series as a whole has become a springboard of sorts for throwing out varied ideas of evolved species.\n\nThe problem is that the first book was so successful in giving us the Portiids it's overshadowed the springboard concept. The series has become one of diminishing returns for a lot of readers precisely because of the ever decreasing focus on the spiders. Memory barely featured them at all in their actual form. While Ruin is my favourite (more for the atmosphere than anything else) and I do find the Nodan parasite to be an interesting concept it's not what the lovers of the first book necessarily wanted the third book to focus on.\n\nIf there ever is to be another sequel, for it to be a success it needs to capture its roots, or its webs, and bring the spiders back to front and centre. There can still be a new species introduced but it must absolutely be Portia and co who are making first contact, investigating, debating, arguing, jumping about, space walking, shooting web lasers or whatever the plot calls for because frankly that was always the magic ingredient.",

That felt like a decent and significant enough of an intro to a character to waste on being simply tossed aside later without any growth.

I couldn't really answer impeccably, so, wanted to know what you guys know. \n\nMy answer: Both would be similar. Embedded is based on PV of accounting profits net of risks. While enterprise is based on cashflows which will be same as accounting profit because LI firms won't have much CapEx. Also, the ANW part wouldn't get captured in Enterprise value. That was also a confusing part. \n\nI don't think this made much sense, but, if any one should shed light on this, it would lovely. TIA."

Sometimes it felt like those days would never end, but 1000 days ago was pretty close to the absolute bottom of the bear market, and Bitcoin was sitting at $3500.\n\nWhen you spend every day looking at charts it can feel like nothing is happening when a week or a month passes with little price movement. But when you zoom out... hot damn.\n\nOf course we must also remember that the market can go down quite as violently as it can go up. When the cycle top comes knocking I'm sure most of us will think we're just gonna keep going the same direction as we've been headed since March 2020.\n\nStill.

Like I can be different at different moments. One moment, I can be the most responsible, organized and sophisticated person with a formal way of talking and a formal style, and the other, I can be incredibly messy, bubbly, crazy person that talks only in slangs and has a comfy style. And I have many of those \u201cmyselves\u201d. Before, I thought that I\u2019m just changing according to different environments, which I thought was \u201cnice, but whatever\u201d. But now, I am sitting in my apartment for days without any \u201cenvironment changes\u201d, but my personalities keep shifting. Like everything changes about me. The way I talk, dress, think, behave, my body language, etc. It\u2019s just scary. I just want to know who *I* am. I don\u2019t have a multiple personality disorder because it\u2019s always \u201cme\u201d. I also read that I could be a social chameleon, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m particularly good at adapting to social situations. It just sucks. I just can\u2019t be \u201cmyself\u201d because I really don\u2019t know which \u201cme\u201d I am. I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could give me some tips on what to do with this because I really have no idea. Thank you."

Now it\u2019s like 10 years later and two of my aunts really try to encourage me to do karaoke, but my sister\u2019s words always come back into my head because she honestly didn\u2019t have a reason to lie as we were basically best friends at the time she said it. It wasn\u2019t like we had a volatile relationship where she would say shit to hurt me. So whether I want them to or not, her words come back into my head because I know she was being completely honest when she said it whereas other people may just say I\u2019m good to be nice.\n\nI would recommend a choir. I joined my high school choir in 9th grade and while my high school experience wasn\u2019t the best because of my director and her lack of understanding of social anxiety, I did gain some confidence and skills. I\u2019m still not ready to sing in front of people by myself but maybe someday I\u2019ll get there. Choir also taught me that I was singing higher than I should have been to sound like a \u201cgirl\u201d and that it\u2019s okay to be a girl and have a low voice.",

It always cancels out with both of us. I have a ps4 and she has a ps5 and we didn\u2019t always have that problem but like the last year. Our games our updated so we were hoping after recent updates it would fix it. Still happens. I believe it\u2019s her connection as I don\u2019t typically have problems although I\u2019ve noticed Cold War zombies has a lot of bugs. We have both redownloaded and reinstalled the games. She even got both the ps4 and ps5 version. She can\u2019t even invite me on the ps5 version. Cross play is enabled. It says there would be more connections issues if I had it disabled. Internet speeds are fine. I can play fine without her and online. So idk what the problem is. Her internet is great and better than mine but she is on WiFi. That would be the only thing I would think but still it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Any other ideas? How is the current support for Cold War? And if I reached out to them would they do anything? Thank you"

I had my reasons to do it just take to long to type and I\u2019ve sinced removed the second line. Anyways Its playable with my hotspot. I could get up to 15mbs download and 2 upload. The weird thing is that at one point my primary line would get good connection but the ps4 would still lag when I played. I tried all these resets on both systems and called AT&T to have them reset stuff in there end, reset network settings etc. I would test connection and my ps4 showed it was getting a good link and speed but still lagging. After I tried everything that I could think of I tried just switching to my secondary line to use the hotspot on that. Sure enough I was having no lags. Same phone, different phone lines and one would work and the other wouldn\u2019t. So my question is can the internet be affected by anything like associated with the numbers? Like what\u2019s interfering my primary line and not secondary if both are on the same phone? The secondary is an eSim. Tried soft reset. On and off. Checked to see if I ran over data plans. Phones up to date. Pretty much what most people would conclude and it\u2019s like it\u2019s either some weird fluke I can\u2019t figure out or I\u2019m missing something. Is it an iOS thing somehow? Posted in r/att and r/iOs also to see if they knew anything. Any help is appreciated."

Neither my agent nor I knew they would be there so I just said uh I\u2019m waiting for my agent and walked away to the end of the driveway. Forgot to even say who I was because I was so surprised. The inspector found me after a bit and brought me into the basement to show me some things and she followed us around like a puppy. Kept getting in my way the whole time and was all up in the inspector\u2019s business while he was explaining things to me. Ended up not being able to walk around the house again properly because it was so beyond awkward. They\u2019re an elderly couple and seem ok but just wanted to sit and chat it up the whole time once everyone was there. This was the first house I had looked at and they accepted my first offer so I suppose I was due for something to happen. At least the inspection itself went decently so there shouldn\u2019t be any issues moving forward. \n\nAnyway, no advice needed but never heard of that happening before.

She gave into E-corp as soon as they gave her a job offer, and then Whiterose as well. She refused to accept accountability when she did something which directly antagonized Elliot\u2019s mission. Everything she claimed to stand for fell in the face of self-preservation. All of this would have been fine if she was self-aware but she was not, she still convinced herself that she was doing the right thing and other people were the issue and how that\u2019s so sad for her. I never got attached to her because she lacks integrity and therefore demonstrates NPC behavior. \n\nI get her purpose in the show, or at least this is how it is from my perspective: I think her purpose in the show is to demonstrate how people in general end up slaves to organizations like E-corp from an inside perspective. This is the average person and how they\u2019re helpless in the face of these corporations and individuals, how easily persuaded they are. This doesn\u2019t really make me like her, I think she\u2019s almost a token character. I know you may be mad at me for saying these things considering you seem to care a lot about this character but I don\u2019t want you to take it personal, these are just my opinions.",

They said unless battery health is getting low to 80% , I can't claim it. The one year warranty is running out in a week , some told me to use it heavily and turn brightness maximum, I doubt is it possible to make the battery health get down for 5% within a week?"

There was a big contest recently and I posted few first chapters of my writing on the contest site. I got voted from readers and judges and I won first runner up. The publisher got me signed 1 year contract so I can continue my work. \n\nJust few months after contest, those first few chapters got published. Every words are the same as in contest but much more audiences (since it's official page) 50% of feedbacks praised my work but the rest also gave negative feedbacks. My story has main character who's bullied and thinks she's the victim one. Of course this character will be develop and grow in the future but I got a lot of comments said they will stop reading because main character has bad mindset. \n\nMy writer friend used to tell me most comments came in this website came from pre-teen or teenagers so they're always like this. My editor told me not to read the comments so I stopped reading it too. But the editor also told me to tone down a little bit of main character behavior too. \n\nA part of me tells me to screw all the comments and just continue on my story since my purpose is to show people that mind is more important than body anyway. They're just too childish to wait for the character to develop. But I also feel down with this and started to doubt at myself am I not good enough like if I'm good enough, I might be able to write the story that can tell same message but no one got disturbed by it. \n\nI dont know what to think anymore."

(I bought it just few months ago so pretty sure it must be under warranty) \n\nShe took the pencil and sent it to repair or replace or whatever. She said I should try to find receipt while waiting for result, if the head center asks for receipt and I don't have it, they will not send the replacement but send back the old one. \n\nIs this true?

(He had also a shotgun hidden in his piano bench, code 14-J, etc\nhttps://youtu.be/J4qbwf1tr7w )\n\nHe was playing a prelude by Rachmaninoff (c#minor).\nThere is a \"story\" about this piece which tells that Rachmaninoff once had a dream: He was on a funeral and when he looked into the grave, he saw himself there. Waking up in terror, he wrote that piece.\nIt's of course just a rumor, there are no sources which really prove this theory.\n\nBut nonetheless, I like this \"legend\" because:\n1. Let's assume the prelude symbolises death (because of its backstory).\n2. Ben plays this prelude before his daughter dies.\nAnd now combine these thoughts.\n\nIsn't this foreshadowing just beautiful?\nLike a bad omen, Ben plays this piece before his daughter and a part of him are going to die..\nAnd we never see Ben playing piano before and after again.\nOf course the \"creepy\" sound of the piece suits Ben's character very well, but I see a deeper meaning in this choice of music.\n(I would really like to know who chose this piece for that scene and for which reasons because in my eyes, the choice is just perfect. I know that Giacchino was responsible for the soundtrack but it could be some other cool dude who had the idea of putting the prelude into this scene)\n\nOn my second rewatch I recently noticed another \"coincidence\":\nIn season 6, Ben is digging his own grave.. Intriguing, isn't it?\n(Sorry that I'm so fascinated by this, it's just that as a musician, I just love this reference..)\n\nThank you for your attention. Have a nice day :)"

I don't give a fuck what my mom or anyone else says, my hair is fucking damaged. it used to be long, thick, healthy, had great shrinkage, held products well, had a uniform, nice 4a s shaped coils all around, and whatever. then the rough combing, not cutting off split ends and the silk presses and blowouts all came and ruined it. the pattern is messed up, almost half of my hair has broken off over the past few years, it's thinned like crazy, my afro is misshapen and uneven from certain angles, it's horrible. and I'm done convinced myself that it's not beyond real reversing and repair cause it is. it fucking is.\n\nbut no, my mom with all her pride and ego, and dare I say vanity wants me to keep my hair so badly. cause she obviously values length and looks more than REAL health. I tell her I wanna cut it off cause it's damaged and I wanna start fresh she acts like I'm \"\"claiming\"\" It's damaged and I should go to a professional to get their opinion, as if it's fucking rocket science to realize that my hair isn't the same as before and maybe it's not a good thing. and like she would want me to get a doctor's opinion first on literally any other health issue, cause she doesn't. it's always straight to the antidotes and other herbal shit. I dealt with terrible, chronic gastrointestinal distress for 6 months and it took for a very bad episode for my mom to finally take me to urgent care, and there I was referred to a gastroenterologist \n\n the hair thing is causing me so much insecurity, shame, and self consciousness. I'm worried what my mom, sister and ppl at school will think of me if I let the hair go. I'm scared I'll be ugly, undesirable, that no guys or girls will find me attractive or try to pursue me the same way they aren't now. even my little brother, tells me I prolly wouldn't look good bald, but I try not to take that personally. I wanna be free, but I guess it comes with a price. \n\nI'm 16, 17 in February and wanted to treat myself to a haircut once I have enough money saved up so I can REALLY show my independence. but idfk anymore man. I sound crazy, I know. but there's so much more my mom has said and done that y'all don't know about, and this kinda stuff is just smaller details in the larger scope of how she treats us. it's fucking twisted and exhausting what emotional abuse does to someone and how crazy it makes one feel \n\n\nI just had to get that all out, even tho I know I'll regret it"

This is just my personal experience, take it with a grain of salt. \n\nSo, North Africans ie Moroccans, Algerians, Tunisians, Libyans etc. Would you say they are Arab? Well, not according to them they\u2019re not. Or at least some of them. Certainly the ones I come across on social media. If you dare utter the words Arab and North African in the same sentence, trust me, you\u2019ll be bombarded with \u201cNorth Africans are not Arab, we\u2019re Amazigh\u201d comments faster than an Armenian genocide comment under a post about Turkey. Although I understand they\u2019re talking about genetically being Amazigh and not Saudi/Yemeni, the Arab identity is ethnolinguistic, not genetic. So as long as they speak Arabic, they\u2019ll continue being technically Arab, regardless of genetics. But they strongly oppose this label nonetheless. They see Arabs as their colonizers rather than their ancestors. \n\nIve seen somewhat similar rhetoric by Levantine Arabs, such as Syrians, Lebanese and Palestinian Arabs. They don\u2019t quite denounce their Arab identity as much as North Africans, they still identify as Arab. But they also make it clear that genetically they see their ancestors as Assyrians, Canaanites, Phoenicians etc. \n\n\nAs for Latinos, although they don\u2019t deny the labels latino or Hispanic, I\u2019ve also found that a good amount of them see Spaniards as their colonizers and not their ancestors. They see themselves as descendant of Latin American natives. Which is actually more odd than the North Africans because latinos actually have a very significant amount of Spanish dna. But regardless, they denounce this identity. \n\nSo this is where Turks come in. Genetically, modern Anatolian Turks are largely Anatolian, with only a portion of their DNA being Central Asian. Turks can very much have a similar mentality to the people mentioned, as their history is similar. But they don\u2019t. Turks see Seljuks and Gokturks etc as their ancestors, not their colonizers. In fact some even like to believe they are more central Asian than they are. Why do you think this is? Secondly, if Turks DID view themselves as Anatolian victims of Turkic expansion, how differently do you think Turks would be treated or viewed by others? \n\nNot saying either mentality is right or wrong btw."

The vaccination document needs to be in English (or translated to English).\n\nThe closest thing to a document my mom was informed of by the hospital is a little mobile notification on e-nabiz that says she's vaccinated (in Turkish) with a barcode number, that's it. \n\nShe's not sure how she can get a certified translator to translate a little mobile notification. \n\nIs there a proper vaccination document that can be obtained? Please help. Thank you.\n\nTurkce:\n\nAnnemle ben Kanada'da yasiyoruz. Annem ilk kovid asi dozunu burda vurdurdu.\n\nGecenlerde annem Turkiye'ye gitti. Ikinci dozunu orda vurdurdu.\n\nSimdi Kanada'ya donmek istiyor.\n\nKarantinaya muaf olmak icin Kanada ful asi vurulduguna dair kanit belgesi istiyor. Bu belge Ingilizce (veya Ingilizce'ye cevrilmis) olmali.\n\nAnnemin gittigi hastanede belge olarak bi tek e-nabiz'da asi vuruldugunu soyleyen barkodlu kucuk bir mobil bilidimi gostermisler, o kadar.\n\nAnnem bu kucuk mobil bildirimini yeminli tercumana nasil cevirtcegini bilmiyor.\n\nAsi oldugunu gosteren daha duzgun bi belge/dokuman elde edilebilirmi? Lutfen yardim edin. Tesekkurler."

And grief seeds can cleanse this corruption from the soul gems, yes? So why don't magical girls just keep collecting grief seeds and using them lol? \n\nI thought at first maybe they can only cleanse the corruption that develops in the soul gems over time, not the corruption caused by despair. But this was proven wrong in one of the flashbacks of Homura's timelines, when she was laying on the ground with Madoka on Walpurgis night with their very dark soul gems in their hands. and they both agreed to give up and become witches together. At that moment, Homura officially despaired. She officially gave up on her mission and surrendered to her fate of becoming a witch. She was probably a few seconds away from becoming a witch at that moment, until suddenly Madoka pulls out a grief seed and uses it on Homura's soul gem, preventing her from becoming a witch. \n\nThis means grief seeds can cleanse the darkness of a soul gem caused by despair as well, as long as you can get to it in time. So with that in mind, isn't it technically possible for a magical girl to live a long life without becoming a witch, as long as she keeps using grief seeds and doesn't end up being killed? \n\nBut the anime implies that every magical girl's fate is to become a witch, if she doesn't die first. Which is what confuses me. \n\nIn fact, couldn't Sayaka been saved perhaps, if Kyouko had a soul gem in her pocket, and used it on Sayaka's soul gem right before she transformed?"

Even if you are a multi billionaire who could never run out of money. If you line the pockets of these companies, you're stupid. Period. \n\nLook, obviously if you genuinely like a product, or it's genuinely high quality, and it simply happens to be really expensive, or be a luxury brand item, of course it's okay to buy it. That's not what I'm talking about, so don't twist it.\n\nI'm talking about the super rich who buy the most mediocre, sometimes even downright ugly shit just because it has a big price tag. This means you're literally just paying the company to attach hefty price tags on their items. That's it. Basically, if you ask why this product is so expensive, the answer is essentially \"because I said so\". And the super rich are like \"yup... makes sense to me. Here, take my money\". People simply all decided that this thing is worth a lot of money for no reason. \n\nAn example is Birkins. The blandest, most mediocre purses on the face of this planet. And yet they go for tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars. Why are they so expensive you might ask?? \"Because I said so\". I'm sure they use nice quality leather, and apply good craftsmanship and all that. Some also have diamond accents n shit, I know. But no amount of the materials or work they put into those products are genuinely worth THAT much.\n\nTheir justification for buying them is always \"I can later resell them for much higher! It's an investment, like real estate!\" well then why don't you just invest in real estate??? \n\nReal estate isn't expensive \"because I said so\" it's actually functional. A piece of real estate's value is directly tied to it's function. Whether that be it's location, the size of the property, the quality of the house etc. People always need real estate because people need a place to live. And the quality of your home will directly effect the quality of your life. A Birkin will not. If suddenly everyone decided Birkins are useless, and therefore not worth a penny, you're done lol. But no one can ever *decide* a piece of real estate is worthless. But even if they did, you can still live in it! Real estate is still valuable even without reselling. A Birkin is not!!\n\nSo yeah, I don't care how rich you are, if you buy an excessive amount of luxury crap, that's not a flex. You're just stupid."

The recognition of the Armenian genocide does not extent to the recognition of the Greek and Assyrian genocides. But they think it does, so they\u2019re celebrating.

I want people who would understand to just hear me out since she wouldn\u2019t. \n\nI had my first consultation/annual appointment last month. During that appointment I was planning to tell my doctor I have trauma. But shockingly she was able to make me so comfortable that I didn\u2019t feel the need to. I have not had an obgyn in years, and have been getting the pill from my primary. I felt like I had had enough therapy to finally conquer the obgyn. \n\nI\u2019ve had painful and irregular periods since they started when I was 11. I have tried several forms of birth control, and none of them seemed to have a profound effect or fit with my lifestyle. I wanted to get an IUD. Yeah. Big mistake. \n\nI was given an appointment to have that placed, I was impressed as I was given valium and a pill to soften my cervix. \n\nI guess as you all can imagine, it did not go smoothly. All I remember was getting there, I was on the table, I cried as she made her first attempt. My memory is in snippets. \n\nShe told me we needed to reschedule because I was crying so much. I got even more upset because I had taken off a day of work at a new job for this. \n\nShe said she needed to bring in a witness, a nurse. She held my hand. I don\u2019t remember anything except screaming at her to stop, I had my legs completely straightened and was pushing myself up the table as far as I could go. \n\nI honestly thought it was failed attempt number 2, but she said she was done. I cried hysterically, I thanked her and apologized, she said something about \u201cthe point of no return\u201d during insertion, and she left. \n\nI laid there and cried hysterically. I had to clean all the blood off of myself. I had someone else do a string check. I cried and cried, I was wailing. I talked to two nurses, one who held my hand. I told them I had trauma. They were very very kind to me. \n\nI left, went home and cried all weekend. I felt like I had no answers, I didnt know what symptoms or sensations were normal. I called a crisis suicide line three times.\n\nOn Tuesday (July 5th, closed on Monday) I called them first thing in the morning to get an appointment. I felt like I needed closure and answers. I didnt feel like I know what I had gotten myself into and what was normal.\n\nThey never called me back. I called again the following day and asked for one of the nurses that spoke to me after my insertion. I told her I needed some questions answered and would like to speak to my dr to directly address my trauma with her.\n\nShe kept asking for clarification of what I meant, told me they\u2019d never had anyone ask for an appointment before. I began getting a little upset but not accusatory, saying I didnt feel like I had any time to ask questions or speak to my dr. They offered a short appt the next day as a \u201ccourtesy.\u201d\n\nI got a call from my dr 20 minutes later, first thing she said was that she was going to break our physician-patient relationship. She sounded so mad. Telling me how inappropriate it was for me to say I didnt have the opportunity to ask questions, that its none of my business what her schedule is, I put her in an extremely uncomfortable position to do the insertion in the state I was in. I was dumbfounded. \n\nI was more so dumbfounded I was told I was there for almost 2hrs. I had no idea. No memory of it.\n\nI met with her the next day, I tried telling her I dont remember any conversations had during my insertion appointment and that I was sorry. She made it clear to me me being triggered is not why she is terminating me, but my behavior afterward. \n\nI still dont know what to think about it."

I will likely delete this post in a while because people on reddit can be terrible humans.\n\nI guess I just want to know if I\u2019m alone or not. I used to post here years ago and have been subbed since. I\u2019ve never seen anyone say this about their experience.\n\nI was raped in May 2017. I was a 19 year old college student who wasn\u2019t totally in order mentally to begin with. I have always struggled with depression and anxiety. I suspect I have a larger diagnosis that has been missed in childhood. After the rape I began smoking a lot of weed daily to cope. I was confused about what happened and scared to admit it to anyone. I pretended like nothing happened.\n\nMonths and months went by. I knew my depression was getting worse and I felt like I was falling down a rabbit hole. By February 2018 I began having psychotic symptoms outwardly. It became an emergency situation by the end of the month.\n\nWhen I was deeply psychotic I had many delusions people were trying to harm or embarrass me. I believed my nude photos were leaked and \u201ceveryone\u201d had seen them. I believed people were peeping in my windows and taking photos. Every time I went in public people were pointing me out and whispering how I was the girl in the photos. \n\nIt progressed into thinking people- \u201cagents\u201d were hiding in my house. I started having short term memory loss and \u201ccoming to\u201d without pants on. I thought the agents were drugging me and doing things to me. I remember thinking they were waiting in my hallway for me to fall asleep and I would wake up with them on top of me. Of course this never happened, but I truly believed it. It was as true as the sky was blue. \n\nI started to believe people could see through my eyes and watch my pov on TV. When I closed my eyes they could see my thoughts. I remember weeping in my moms chest on the couch thinking that her and my dad were watching my flashbacks on TV. That was horrific and still breaks my heart.\n\nBecause people could see through my eyes, I was careful in the bathroom and shower. I thought everyone was waiting for me to slip up finally. I eventually looked in the mirror on purpose to gain control over it. I also tried to run outside naked because of this. Thankfully I was stopped by my mother.\n\nI was finally admitted into the hospital early March. I have no memories the first few weeks. I remember telling my parents about what happened maybe two weeks in. That is when I started getting better. \n\nAfter the hospital the treatment I was referred to was terrible. They were not concerned about why I ended up in the hospital but only on stabilizing me and getting me back to work and school. They were only concerned with alcohol and drug use and made it sound like me smoking weed was the only reason I was there. I\u2019m not saying it helped, but I think that was only a piece.\n\nYears went by where I believed my rape played no part. My post-hospital treatment downplayed it and made it seem like it was just something that happened. I thought I must have dealt with it by being psychotic about it. I still struggle with thinking it was no big deal, and that I should just get over it.\n\nI started thinking it was related maybe two years ago. I finally told my therapist about it maybe two months ago. I still have a long way to go. But I\u2019m just heartbroken my life has suffered this much longer because I was made to believe it wasn\u2019t a big deal. \n\nIs there anyone else out there?"

Finally undergoing trauma therapy and dealing with a myriad of things I\u2019ve never had the opportunity to process professionally- including my psychotic episode. \n\nI was talking with my therapist and mentioned during my episode I would frequently fall to the floor. I don\u2019t remember a good chunk of my hospitalization, but I was told I had to be on 1:1 for a few weeks because I was so unpredictable, and that I would randomly fall backwards. I have some memories of my hand being held while walking around. \n\nSome context: I was hospitalized for a month in March 2018. I started throwing up almost everything I ate mid/late Feb. I now realize my anxiety was making me do that. I couldn\u2019t keep anything down, and I was so manic I wasn\u2019t terribly hungry anyway. Maybe a week or so before hospital I started having strong delusions that I was being poisoned, and refused to eat or drink anything. (I was bribed/tricked into having a few sips and bites of food- threw it up regardless.) When I entered the hospital though I had given up and if I was going to be poisoned and die, I\u2019ll die.\n\nThe times I do remember falling pre-hospital were triggered by an intense panic, I couldn\u2019t feel my legs anymore and my whole body would shake.\n\nI was told by my mom in the hospital I would be walking down the hall and just say something like \u201coh god I can\u2019t do it anymore\u201d and just collapse. I do remember one time, barely. I was holding someone\u2019s hand and started falling backwards, they caught me. I don\u2019t think I actually went down.\n\nThe times I remember didn\u2019t feel voluntary yet I also don\u2019t recall losing consciousness. I\u2019ve been trying to research what it could\u2019ve been: just panic attacks? Lack of nutrients? Or is it something else? \n\nHas anyone had anything like this?"

I can\u2019t understand how I can\u2019t find a single bra to fit the way I wish it would. \n\nThe only bra to come close to satisfying this is Skarlet Blue Minx Balconette. Which I have worn and rebought to an embarrassingly ratty and frayed degree. But it doesn\u2019t cut it for my plunge shirts, and the side lace shows in tank tops. Am I being too picky?

Here are the most common issues I see. \n\nGetting shot through walls is not just commonplace, but expected. It happens to me at least twice a game. I\u2019m also able to do it myself to other players. It\u2019s just really bad latency or desync or something. \n\nRubber banding, especially in the opening moments of a match, consistently happens after the winter update. I also see it a lot when mantling. \n\nMelee is absolutely, completely, broken. The hit detection is inconsistent, phasing through enemies while trying to melee them is commonplace, accidental backsmacks from the front are common, hitting people in the back often won\u2019t trigger a backsmack, sometimes a hit connects but the sound won\u2019t play and the damage won\u2019t trigger, the lunge range is inconsistent, etc. All this is made worse by desync, which causes enemies to sometimes miraculously lunge at you about 10 feet then rubber band backwards about 10 feet after hitting the melee. It\u2019s in an absolutely nightmarish state. \n\nShield effects don\u2019t consistently convey how much shield a Spartan has left. \n\nLeaving games isn\u2019t adequately punished because people do it often. Also, games where someone leaves in the first 30 seconds should immediately end with no elo loss for either side. People are afk from the start of the match aren\u2019t kicked quickly enough. Feels like an eternity goes by that they\u2019re just handing the enemy free kills in slayer. \n\nSpawns on the Pit remake don\u2019t switch, spawnkilling is extremely easy on this map if a team knows what they\u2019re doing.\n\nThe elo reward system punishes mediocre or bad individual gameplay a lot more than it rewards great individual gameplay.\n\nCommon bug where the spectating screen breaks in round-based modes. \n\nTheater sucks. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s bad UI design or just buggy or both. Trying to navigate it is a completely incoherent experience. \n\nGrenades commonly evaporate after being thrown. On the new forge maps, they (sometimes, but rarely) get stuck on the geometry instead of bouncing normally. \n\nNeedler damage is inconsistent. \n\nExplosion radii are inconsistent (this could be  100% desync). \n\nDesync frequently causes missed shots to connect and vice versa. \n\nThe repulsor often causes rubber-banding. It also affects people through thin surfaces/around corners. Not sure if intentional."

Silly, I know. But fun!\n\nAccording to the Fallout wiki, Toshiro is from the Azuchi-Momoyama period. According to the internet, Samurai from this time were concerned with expanding their power and earning glory in combat, with little emphasis on personal wealth.\n\nI know Toshiro will gravitate towards a new Daimyo, or master, as Samurai did. So, Caesar or House. Caesar is primarily concerned with expanding power, but would his methods seem honorable to an ancient Samurai? Maybe by some antiquated definitions of the word? Fun fact: Slavery was still a thing in Japan until the era that followed the time that Toshiro got abducted by aliens.\n\nMaybe House too, because the way he attempts to manage the Three Families and other tribes of New Vegas might be kind of reminiscent of the feudalism in ancient Japan(???).\n\nI personally like House more but I'm trying to see this from an ancient Samurai's perspective. Anyways, who do you think I should go with from an RP standpoint? Caesar or House?"

If I were the first warden at the end of any given blight, I would take advantage of the fact that all the nations of Thedas seem to be paying attention, and bring in as many recruits as possible to create a United Darkspawn killing army the likes of which Thedas has never seen. \n\nThen this army of grey wardens would storm the deep roads and at least secure the old god prisons, if not outright destroy the remaining old gods. Why chance it? Why wait? What is to be gained by packing up, going home, and falling into obscurity for another hundred years? Even if the plan fails miserably, it seems like a smarter idea than just sitting around and hoping that the Darkspawn don\u2019t get up to any monkey business in the deep roads.\n\nTo be honest, I think Grey Warden leadership might know something about the old gods that the rest of the order doesn\u2019t. Because this \u201cwait and see\u201d approach seems like a waste of time otherwise.\n\nIt\u2019s also, frankly, irresponsible of the order to somehow know the locations of the old god prisons and just decide it\u2019s not their problem until that ticking time bomb spills out onto the surface of some poor nation."

He would stab furniture, set everything on fire, killed my parakeets, tortured and killed small animals, put my cat in a full toolbox and rolled her down a hill, beat our younger brother daily and attempted to drown me. He was also socially awkward, sexist, homophobic and a complete moron. I know that our childhood was incredibly messed up and we were all bound to develop some issues but the rest of us became more self-destructive instead of taking it out on others. We hadn't spoken in years because he was angry with me for escaping as soon as he was old enough and big enough to defend himself. He never forgave me. He shot himself in January and left a note. I knew his life couldn't have been easy because we grew up in the same family but I always did my best to protect him for as long as I could. According to the note, he was raped by the same guy who raped me and neither of us ever told anyone. I feel awful that I couldn't help him but kind of guilty because I'm relieved that his life ended before he killed someone, which is genuinely something I was always worried about. When my youngest brother heard the gun go off and ran in to find his body, I was sitting on the couch visiting my family and my dad got a text from him saying that there was an emergency, don't call, just come over. I messaged my husband to tell him something was going on and he asked what I thought it was. I literally said, \"(My dead brother's name), probably finally killed someone and (my other brother's name,) is probably freaking out.\" I was right but the person he killed was himself. I feel so sad that he was in pain and that there's no chance for reconciliation. I haven't managed to cry but the stress of the loss, has been causing panic attacks so severe, the EMTs thought I was having a seizure. I just don't know how to feel about any of this."

Over time, things got more intense. I was sleeping on the couch one night and saw this white, demonic figure creeping over. I closed my eyes and pretended it wasn't there but panicked when I could feel it shaking the couch. I managed to ignore it and get to sleep after a few hours but woke up covered in gigantic black bruises all over my hips, thighs and butt. Something definitely touched me. After that, things started to escalate. Objects would completely disappear, we suddenly started having spiders everywhere, electronics constantly glitch out, there are strange smells we can't identify, randomly extreme temperature changes, leaking plumbing, strange sounds coming from empty rooms, we get the urge to talk out loud when we think we're alone, we randomly wake up too early some mornings and my husband gets huge waves of sadness when he changes rooms sometimes. While I was staying with family, he called me and he hates making phone calls, so I knew it was something serious. He had gotten home from work to find an inexplicable scene in our apartment. The doors and windows were locked and the apartment complex said that no one had been to our place but there was clearly someone in our home while he was gone. The smoke detector was missing,  the was a huge wet spot in the middle of our bedroom floor and some liquid dripping off the tv. Nothing else was wet, including the book that was under the dripping TV or the ceiling above the floor and TV. My husband spent an hour cleaning it up and was convinced that he must've imagined all of it. That is, until he went to fix the TV 2 days ago. He opened up the back and found more moisture and water damage on the inside but just in one small space, so we know that it definitely happened.

It can therefore be concluded that the prevention of pregnancy was the consequence of progesterone antagonism\u201d*\n\nIf you look at page 9,10 or 41 you\u2019ll see what it says about pregnancy. To spare you some time, although I recommend you reread the report on page 10 you have this fragment: \n\n*\u201eThe ability of ulipristal acetate to terminate pregnancies was investigated in the guinea-pig and monkey. Ulipristal, mifepristone and lilopristone were approximately equipotent at the dose levels of 10 and 30 mg/day in terminating pregnancies in guinea-pigs when the animals were treated on days 43 and 44 of gestation. Pregnant long-tailed macaques (5/group) were administered ulipristal acetate 0.5 or 5 mg/kg/day p.o. or 0.5 mg/kg/day i.m. on days 23-26 of gestation. Pregnant animals were assessed by ultrasound pretreatment (day 23) and then monitored on days 26-28, 30, 32, 35, 55, 80, 100, 130 and 145. At 0.5 mg/kg of ulipristal acetate there was no loss of foetuses, while at 5 mg/kg 2/5 foetuses were lost. When using intramuscular administration of 0.5 mg/kg 4/5 foetuses were lost in ulipristal acetate treated animals. In monkeys in which pregnancy continued and which were allowed to deliver normally, there was no evidence of structural or physiological abnormalities in foetuses.\u201d*\n\nAt 0.5mg/kg there was no loss of foetuses. EllaOne contains 30mg of ulipristal acetate, so it\u2019s 0.5mg/kg for a 60kg woman. Also only 2/5 of foetuses where lost at 5mg/kg but it means that a 60kg woman would have to take 10 pills and still, she would only have 40% chance of miscarriage. It would also cost her around 1350 pln, because in SuperPharm EllaOne costs around 135 pln. \n\nIn summery, you\u2019re dumb af and have no critical thinking skills.\n\nEdit: formating",

They also told me, that getting a time extension for exams is possible to arrange, but I\u2019d have to speak to my dean or every professor separately.\n\nI plan to schedule a meeting with my dean but I don't know what I can ask for except time extension on exams. I've never had any other accommodations throughout the school, so I have no idea what can be considered a standard. I live in a country where those kinds of issues are not largely recognized, so people, in general, have rather small knowledge regarding things that can be helpful.\n\nWhat kind of accommodations were you offered/you wish you were offered at university? \nAlso, would it be disrespectful to ask a professor for written instructions? He teaches computer science and he usually just tells us what we are supposed to do, but he\u2019s so chaotic in what he\u2019s saying that I find it hard to keep up and I have APD that only adds to it.\n\nEdit: they can apply either to online and on-site learning"

(the d7200 had dual slots for backup)\n\nComplaints: The D90's native ISO of 200 threw me off, next time use same native iso. \n\nD90 had trouble focusing, especially in backlit scenes, missed some nice expressions. \n\nMy focal length choices were good, but had to change lenses too often. Next time rent a 24-70.\n\nShould have a flash on the second camera body during speeches to capture reactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dynamics:**\n\nIt was a friend of a friend, this put more pressure than I should have for a first wedding because I felt the responsibility not only for myself but also for my friends reccommendation.\n\nThe bride wanted me to take charge and direct, but the impression i got from everybody else was the opposite. I didn't really know if i was being too intrusive or not, but the mixed messages stunted me a little.\n\nIn the madness of it all I didn't actually take many photos of the couple alone. I'm unsure how to navigate this, should i offer a free couple shoot at a later date?\n\nEach time I set the subjects up, I should have said something like, \"alright relax for a second while a get my camera dialled\", so that i didn't have to hear \"what do you want us to do?\" while i was dialling exposure.\n\nI adhered to the schedule, which was nice. The only delays were not caused by me, phew. Still, i should have advised the bride to allow more wiggle room in their schedule, because there was zero room for error.\n\nThe couple had a two-year-old, he was crying and clinging to them through the whole ceremony and family portraits. Nothing that anybody could do about the ceremony, but for the family portraits. I should have beforehand told them to assign the toddlers favourite aunt/uncle to stand behind me and get them to look and smile at me. \n\nI absolutely hated the family portraits. the bride expected me to go and find everybody, i didn't know their name or faces, and they kept running away. I found some help from someone who knew them. this should all have been organised in advance, and they should have been told to be ready. Getting them to look at the camera was another battle. Next time I will definitely tell the bride to notify the family beforehand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll things considered the bride and groom expressed sincere gratitude, and I feel far more prepared for the next one. Would love to hear any comments and advice."

Through extensive meditation and inner work, I have been able to rid myself of this OCD, however. I used to have bad POCD, but haven't had a thought like that in months. \n\nOne of the key things I realized is that your OCD really is your brain's survival mechanism, trying to steer you out of trouble. I know it is easier said than done, but allowing yourself to feel those emotions you've been botteling up is key. ERP exists for a reason, to help you take distance from your thoughts, and identify them as such. It really won't work to push the thoughts back, because they are trying to steer you in the right direction. Like if you have POCD, allow yourself to feel the fear of being a pedophile, and then you'll be able to identify it as such, a **fear**\\- a **feeling**\\- not **reality!!** \n\nIt is definitely easier said than done, but i believe in you guys!!\n\nTogether we **can** fight this!  \nlove"

I only really just started sending full-face pics to girls, and I only do that so I don't look as insecure as I feel. But when it comes to posing, I have no clue what to do. I never know what angle to hold the phone, how close to hold it, or what face to make. It feels like when I send snaps that capture my features in a more flattering way, it comes off like I'm trying to hard or just awkward in general. But when I just send stupid pictures, it's hard to imagine someone will take me seriously.\n\nI think this is mostly because I have kind of a warped perception of my own appearance. Usually if I show someone else a picture that I don't think I look good in, they tell me I look perfectly fine. But it's still tricky. Does anyone have any tips and tricks?

It was released on the band's 1994 album Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain. The song is known for its catchy, upbeat melody and clever, literate lyrics, which explore themes of nostalgia, longing, and the passage of time.\n\nThe song is written from the perspective of someone who is looking back on a past relationship or experience and longing for the feeling of youth and innocence that it represented. The lyrics suggest that the narrator is trying to recapture the feeling of being young and carefree, and are full of references to memories, dreams, and the passage of time.\n\nOverall, \"Gold Soundz\" is a nostalgicically-themed song that explores the longing for lost memories and the desire to recapture the feeling of youth and innocence. It is one of Pavement's most popular and enduring songs, and has been widely praised for its catchy melody and clever lyrics.\n\n**Me:** I love that analysis. May I ask how you formulated it?\n\n**AI:** Thank you for your kind words. As a language model, I was designed to analyze and interpret language patterns and trends in order to generate responses to a wide range of questions and statements. To formulate my response about \"Gold Soundz,\" I drew on my understanding of the themes and lyrics of the song, as well as my knowledge of Pavement's music and their place in the indie rock scene of the 1990s.\n\nIn general, I try to provide detailed and informative responses to the questions and statements that I receive, by drawing on my extensive training on a diverse range of topics. I do not have personal experiences or feelings, so I rely on the patterns and trends in language that I have learned from my training data to generate my responses. I hope this helps to explain how I was able to formulate my response about \"Gold Soundz.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Damn, bro knew what it was talking about. I've seen people analyze the song before and say similar things, but this was the most concise and well-written explanation I've seen of it and it was by a Chatbot. Pretty cool if I do say so myself.*"

If I work the register, I will occasionally have to ring up the (non-vegan) chocolate bars they sell at the counter. Even worse, it seems like they occasionally have employees work at the Starbucks counter if it's understaffed, which means I'm serving almost entirely non-vegan food. I'm new to being vegan so I don't know how much of an issue this is, but even I don't really love the idea of serving people dairy products. Still, there are a lot of reasons why I want to work here so would this be enough of an issue for me to scrap the idea?\n\nThere aren't a lot of 100% vegan gigs for me to choose from where I live. Another option I was considering was a healthfood store called Green's that sells a lot of vegan food, but even there they still sell some meat.

Build up the no-fly zone, at least partially. Sink the black sea fleet. Shoot a number of missiles on Russian key military operation points. Just any sign of serious consequences for crossing a line.\n\nThe problem with international alliances (like NATO) is that there is no international court instance to force the parties to follow up with the contract when it gets serious. Ignoring article 5 in situations like this is a serious threat to the whole alliance. Stay strong, NATO.",

But imagine a reinforcement learning scenario similar to StarCraft and AlphaStar.\n\nLet's say an AI has access to many \"cheap\" options. And so it explores that space and uses them in many combinations, etc. But it also has access to an \"expensive\" option, like a nuke or a battleship. What would drive it to wait on spending gold to stop iterating on cheap options and commit to buying something expensive?\n\nI'm weirdly assuming it would get stuck in some sort of local optimum of playing well with only cheap units. Like how a StarCraft AI trained from zero might only build SCVs and no advanced units.\n\nDo you have to change the fitness function to reward exploration? Like reward saving money and reward buying expensive units? How do people currently solve this problem?\n\nIn OpenAI Five, one expensive encounter with a mega unit (Roshan) was worked around by having different iterations of Roshan, that are sometimes cheap and sometimes expensive, so that the AI would learn that Roshan is an option on the table. But this kind of learning only works when the expensive scenarios are configurable, and thus you're training on a much wider space where the scenario is variable in expense, versus the one canonical scenario where it is always expensive."

I was looking at his bio to find out how to address him in communication, and I found out that he only has a Bachelor's degree in Journalism and absolutely no education or experience in Sociology. To be quite frank, I'm pretty sure I have more education in Sociology than he does. Not only that, but he's way overconfident in class when he clearly has no idea what he's talking about. In our last class, he kept pronouncing Immanuel Kant's name as \"can't,\" and when I politely corrected him, he joked about it the entire class. He claimed he was pronouncing it wrong because he didn't want it to sound like \"another word.\" At one point later in the class he literally said I was \"taking up space in his mind rent free\" for pointing it out to him, as if it was this huge deal to learn the name of the philosopher whose work he is teaching. Honestly it makes me think he's the kind of professor who makes fun of minority students' names instead of learning how to pronounce them. He's also taken to this one male student in the class, even though I and other female students have contributed as much as, if not more, than the male student. This part is typical, and even though it's unfair I might be able to keep my mouth shut about it if he had any education in Sociology whatsoever. I looked at the other sections for this particular course and every single one of the other professors has a PhD in Sociology. All of these sections are full so I can't transfer.\n\nI just can't respect this man as a teacher. How am I supposed to when he has no education in this field? Should I complain about it to the school?"

She\u2019s honestly the only family member who loved me as a child. The other one is about 4. The younger cat constantly tries to \u201cplay fight\u201d with the older cat, and she has been doing this ever since we got her as a kitten. On top of that, my nparents refuse to take proper care of either of them. They only scoop out their litter boxes (both of which they keep upstairs) about once or twice a week and only change the litter every 2-3 months. This has caused problems in the past, with the older cat using the bathroom in places other than the litter box. I\u2019ve also only ever seen them clean out their food and water bowls once or twice. The older cat has been sneezing chronically for years now, and while my nparents claim they\u2019ve taken them to the vet to get their shots, I\u2019m inclined not to believe them. \n\nI am in college and I moved out about a year and a half ago. I wanted to take my older cat with me so she could get away from the younger one who stresses her out, but I couldn\u2019t because my apartment didn\u2019t allow pets. This year I found an apartment that allows pets, however I got randomly assigned with a roommate who is allergic to cats. I was really excited and ready to finally get the older cat the proper care she needs and really disappointed to find out that I couldn\u2019t. \n\nMy question is, what should I do about this situation? Should I report them for animal neglect and risk never seeing my cat again? I know it\u2019s selfish to put me wanting to see her before her wellbeing. She may or may not get better care than she is getting now. I believe if I did this she would go to a humane society where they don\u2019t kill animals, but honestly I don\u2019t really trust those to take good care of her either and it\u2019s pretty likely she wouldn\u2019t get adopted since she\u2019s 12 now. \n\nI was thinking about trying to find a foster home until I or my roommate can move next year? Our lease doesn\u2019t expire until the end of next July. \n\nI\u2019m really unsure of what to do and could really use some advice. Thanks."

Satan?\", etc. Which is why he\u2019s my favorite.\nAlso James Wong wrote \"Smoldering Children\", \"Tricks and Treats\", \"The Replacements\u201d and \"Orphans\u201d which I love.\n \n- **Director(s):** Even tho he only did three of them, Michael Lehmann directed two of the show\u2019s greatest episodes; \"Smoldering Children\", and my #1 Best Episode Ever, \"The Name Game\". Also Angela Bassett, although she directed only two episodes, she did a great job on \"Chapter 6\" from Roanoke and \"Drinking the Kool-Aid\u201d from Cult.\n\nSo, who are your favorite directors or writers?

When investigated the evidence showed quite the opposite, but now when we ask to look into why something hasn\u2019t been right with voting, we\u2019re branded, once again, as conspiracy theorists and there isn\u2019t even a possibility of something wrongful taking place.\n\nIt\u2019s just ironic how short the memory of a Democrat is.

This is probably the most angry I\u2019ve been in my life because running is what I\u2019m passionate about and not being able to do that has affected me negatively in other aspects of my life as well.\n\nSo I\u2019d just say, make sure you\u2019re doing everything possible to make sure you\u2019re not damaging your body. It took me a while to figure out that REST DAYS ARE OKAY. You need rest days, as much as you might not want to, your body needs it. Figure out some sort of running plan and workout plan (whether with a physio, PT, or just from online) that is actually strengthening your body rather than damaging it. Because there\u2019s no point doing all this work just to get injured and put it all to waste. Recovery is more important than the actual work you\u2019re putting in. STAY HARD.",

That's the first reason why I'm keen for his Saberstaff. Here's the thing though... For my particular creative project I need the staff to quickly come apart at some point, to create 2 light sabers. Obviously, Maul does this in the movies (with help from Obi-Wan!) but is this quick effect possible with a decent neopixel saberstaff from the Lgt/Darkwolf etc?\n\nIf separating the staff is an intricate + delicate process, I will just purchase 2 separate sabers and manually combine them with my own mod.\n\nAny opinions or advice greatly appreciated!"

Keep in mind that since it was a while ago, I'm not going to be able to recall it with much accuracy, but I've been searching for it everywhere and can't find anything on it, so I'm still giving this a shot.\n\nSo I was watching Noragami on my phone and around the middle of the episode, an animated old woman (realistic style, kind of resembled Hama from Avatar) with dark eyes flashing red ([something like this](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9f6o8V97pts/Vv3TfobmxNI/AAAAAAAAgXY/xhNJlmpVY04PUYOFPr7F85m4EBV21G4Cw/s1600/Jin-Roh%2B3.jpg)) comes on screen. Cue another screen change and there appeared a black screen with white text reading \"stop watching this if you don't want to know the truth\" or something like that. This is likely not what it actually said, but I'm certain that it 1) told you to stop watching/keep watching, and 2) something would happen if you did so.\n\nAt that point, I force quit the app since there was no skip button and I was really creeped out. When I got back on the app, it was gone and I never saw it again. I instantly looked it up after that, but I didn't find anything on it back then either. I assumed it had been a hack since it didn't seem like an ad in the first place, but I can't find any people discussing a hack of that nature on Crunchyroll either.\n\nSo here are my questions for you guys: **have you ever gotten something similar to this before? Do you know any horror animes with an old lady as a relevant character?** \n\nTL;DR: I got a scary ad (or something) mid-episode a while ago and I want to know that my house isn't haunted."

People tell me my great personality is great, and I have many traits which could easily make someone fall in love with me overtime, but it\u2019s an overwhelming feeling I have which won\u2019t leave me alone and really upsets me sometimes. \n\nIt\u2019s most likely because I\u2019ve been molested by people close to me twice now, with the addition that most of the people I\u2019ve dated have been more sexual than romantic with me. My first love ended up just wanting me sexually, and often confused his lust for love; he ended up leaving me for another girl he actually felt something for. That fucked me up a lot. That was my first serious relationship, and it was the purest thing ever at the beginning. We told each other every day how much we loved each other, and how we would always be there for one another. To think that something which felt so permanent and true once could spiral down to a mere friends with benefits relationship, and eventually nothing, is just something which is very hard for me to accept. I don\u2019t know how I can trust that anyone will stick around for longer than a year after that.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because all the guys I\u2019ve found are just idiots, or if it\u2019s something in my personality that encourages people to act this way. Maybe relationships nowadays are generally more sexual in nature and I\u2019m just naive for craving something different, but either way, I feel unlovable and fear that I may never find someone with enough patience to really get to know me before trying to attempt anything else. I\u2019m scared that I will never find someone who actually respects my boundaries and is concerned enough about my mental well-being to be cautious with sexual activities. I just want someone who will love me for who I am.\n\n((Thank you for reading until the end.

I'll agree with people saying that we do have an impact on the world, no matter how small, but does that really matter in the grand scheme of things? Eventually the earth and our entire solar system will come to an end, and I know some of you will say something along the lines of \"well it doesn't matter if it will end, we are thrown in here against our will and it's better to do something useful with our time here than to just mope around until death,\" but you know what? Fuck that. I don't care if I'm being unreasonable or if there is a way to resolve my unhappiness, I don't want it. I just don't like living. I hate the cycle, the human limitations, the fact that I need to do shit like have a bunch of friends, exercise, eat balanced meals to be able to be happy.\n\nI really don't care if I have a \"purpose\" in life.

My ex and I broke up about 10 months ago, and the cut still feels fresh sometimes, mostly because I have to interact with him in almost a daily basis because we attend the same school. I\u2019ve distanced myself, but that makes things just as painful because then I just watch him move on. He\u2019s got new friends he\u2019s closer to (we used to be extremely close friends for 4 years prior dating, which only makes it more painful to let him go), a new girlfriend, new interests, etc. And I can\u2019t be a part of it all\u2014a fact which is very painful to accept.\n\nI think the worst part of it, however, is all the broken promises that go along with moving on. He used to tell me that he would never stop loving me, and that I was the center of his universe; now he doesn\u2019t even glance at me when we\u2019re in the same room. He used to tell me that he would never harm me\u2014that the mere thought of it made him want to die, but by now he has slapped my thighs so hard he\u2019s bruised them, slingshotted a deflated balloon at my face, and twisted my arm until I begged him to stop. These all spell out \u201cultra violent dude who you are better off without,\u201d and maybe he is actually violent and those weren\u2019t actually jokes like he said they were, but even if that was the case, I just can\u2019t shake off these stupid feelings. \n\nOur relationship was perfect while it lasted, I would say. We supported each other, had fun with each other, and most importantly, loved each other more than we had loved anyone else. I have never bonded so deeply with someone else as I did with him, and that\u2019s probably the reason why I can\u2019t get over him. He\u2019s the only one thus far who has been able to hold a deep conversation with me, and who has shared my passion for scientific or philosophical topics. He\u2019s the only one I have ever felt who was truly on my level. A kindred spirit, or a soulmate, if we want to take it so far.\n\nSo I\u2019ve lost a soulmate, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so painful to deal with these feelings. I know that there isn\u2019t a \u201cthe one,\u201d and that I will most certainly love again (because I AM quite young and have a long way ahead of me), but hell, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that I will completely get over this, does it? It simply means that I may need to just learn to deal with this grief, because that\u2019s what it is; I\u2019m mourning the death of a relationship, and at a certain degree, of the person. \n\nWell, at the end of the day, this is a learning experience. A very painful learning experience, that\u2019s for sure, but sometimes the hardest lessons are the ones which are most valuable. I will survive, and I will emerge from this a stronger, more mature person. \n\nI will survive."

It's fun to do that hypothetical, but IMHO that sidesteps the main purpose of Toji/Maki character designs in the whole story. They were never designed to be epic sorcerers or adept at cursed spirit exorcisms. without cursed energy they were failures in the Jujutsu world and were therefore shunned.\n\nWhat Toji and Maki were born for, story wise, almost their (inevitable) raisin detre: being sorcerer killers. Both Toji and Maki would get wrecked by special grade curses, but they could hold their own against even the top sorcerers. Every single fight where Maki and Toji have truly shone has been about killing other humans.\n\nMaki's rise to prominence in the JJK storyline is happening deliberately at the same time the overall plot has moved completely away from exorcising curses to dueling against malevolent sorcerers."

I just started watching anime and death note was the first show I watched a couple of weeks ago (which I also loved). When I went looking online for anime similar to death note all I got was the worst recommendations. I haven\u2019t finished full metal alchemist yet but I\u2019m on the third season and I\u2019m not loving it. It\u2019s just a little too immature for me, and feels very cartoonish. Too much fantasy and action, and very little depth. Despite it having none of the interesting themes of death note, it was the one that was recommended to me the most.\n\nThankfully, I somehow found Erased although it was barely recommended. Something about it was so impressive. The dialogue felt.. just really well written compared to these other anime\u2019s I\u2019ve tried watching (full metal, code geass, etc) The characters actually had depth, the story was deep and meaningful, it wasn\u2019t childish and the plot kept me on the edge of my seat.\n\nAre there any anime\u2019s similar to Erased? I don\u2019t mean time travel related, which seems to be the main answer when people have asked this same question. I mean an anime that isn\u2019t childish or has over exaggerated/ over complicated plots/characters. An anime where the dialogue is natural and well-written, with a plot that is deep and meaningful. Not action based."

Get good (not as an insult or to berate you, you genuinely just aren't playing good enough  to break past silver, no wonder you hate it).\n2. Toughen your skin, people are naturally going to be assholes when they know nobody knows who they actually are. There's mute and avoid buttons for a reason.\n3.

A leak seems to me like it would need air more frequently than that. Obviously I'll keep an eye on it, but do you think it might be a leak to get fixed?

I have certainly known other autistic folks who are borderline hoarders and/or have bad hygiene, but I also know plenty if NT folks who are similar. \n\nI can\u2019t deal with it. If I\u2019m somewhere cluttered I get lots of anxiety. If I\u2019m somewhere dirty, with dust everywhere and animal hair all over the furniture, it makes my skin crawl.

So much to gain from making your love happy. \n\nBut that's not really taught to boys in society. Which is sad for them and their partners. Theres so much sex ed that people need to be taught. There are still a lot of guys out there that will care about sexually satisfying your needs, dont settle for anything less. I feel like they're in the minority but having a partner receptive to good communication is all you really need to fix said problems. I wish you luck :)",

He wakes once or twice before we get up so hopefully I can resettle him in his bed and then sneak back out but I'm sure I'll end up sleeping in the king single for a few nights as well. \n\nNever would have thought I'd have shared a bed with my kids for this long. Don't regret a single minute of it."

To me, it maybe answers how you like to write/your process. But on top of that, your message could be interpreted too many ways, so it doesn\u2019t communicate an idea of you as a musician.\n\n\nDo YOU feel like you\u2019re rearranging rocks when you compose, or does the sound have the VIBE of rearranging rocks? Like subtle details and barely noticeable changes? Is your music more like soundscapes than songs? By arcane, do you mean it\u2019s not easy to interpret?  Like that there is no obvious \u201cpurpose\u201d or \u201csound\u201d because it\u2019s not tied to typical symbols or meanings? Or is it \u201cmystical\u201d feeling, like meditation music? Or #2, does it sound medieval or prehistoric? \n\n\nI just don\u2019t think your reply communicates a clear idea of what music you make. Now that\u2019s ok, some people communicate that way and don\u2019t mind the ambiguity. But if you generally do want people to understand and reply, try to give more clarity. If your music doesn\u2019t fit a specific genre, say that so they know how to interpret what comes next. Clarify whether you\u2019re describing the sound, vibe, process, or message. Or just say what you want the result of listening to be. Like, do you want people to experience something profound? Do you want them to relate to it? Do you want them to cry? smile? relax? If it\u2019s something hard to describe, say it\u2019s hard to describe or put into words, that you just have to hear! That\u2019s my main advice. If it\u2019s something meaningful to you, you don\u2019t have to totally change the way you talk about it, there will be someone out there who gets it exactly as you said it. But if you want to connect with more people, generally, you need to provide more clarity and use references they can actually build on to understand.",

It wasn\u2019t really a curse but I\u2019ve been carrying suppress anger and grief my entire life that has become dissociation, about these people and finally felt I want to release it in some kind of ceremonial way. I immediately felt some kind of brief relief from my dissociation, like my true personality came back for at least a little bit. Then I see a post on art or some subreddit here with the rose cross but had no idea what it was, just thought it looked pretty. I just met a witch friend online and she mentioned this name, and it sounded odd at first but I looked up their website, and I was a taken aback because I see the rose cross on there. So I think that this secret society could be calling me intuitively but I don\u2019t know anything about it. Any witches here have suggestions on how to find information for myself and if I can trust this or not? Sorry if I\u2019m not asking the right way, fairly amateur on this sub but just trying to get enlightened. Thank you!"

                "body": "Hello y\u2019all,\n\nI found this subreddit super helpful while studying and wanted to give back with some tips. My diag was 152 (Jun 2019), my first LSAT was 167 (Jun 2020), and my retake was 178 (Aug 2020). Hope this helps!\n\n**Favorite Prep Materials**\n\nI tried a bunch of different books, but these helped me the most:\n\nI took a Blueprint course to acquaint myself with the test, since the initial learning curve is big. It was great for helping me learn the basics of each section! You could also self-study (would take longer) or take another course with high reviews.\u00a0\n\nFor LG, **7Sage** and **Powerscore LG Bible** were amazing. This was originally my weakest section, but Powerscore LG Bible helped me become solid on the fundamentals and develop an intuition for setting up games. 7Sage explained every single game so well; definitely worth the investment!\n\nLG advice \u2013 I bombed this section in June 2020. LG is a big hit or miss for me\u2026it\u2019s either -0 or like -6/7. What helped me on my retake was\u00a0**taking time to read each stimulus/rule carefully.**\u00a0A misunderstood rule leads to wrong/missed inference, which basically ruins the whole game LOL. So I recommend investing upfront in the diagram, finding inferences, and reading carefully! It\u2019s 100% worth it.\n\nFor LR, I highly recommend\u00a0**The Loophole**, especially if you want to improve your reading speed on stimuli or want to learn exactly what to do with each question type! Helped me breakthrough in LR.\n\nFor RC,\u00a0**Reddit** and **Manhattan Prep RC** were great.\u00a0\n\nRC advice \u2013 I recommend just looking for the main point,\u00a0location (of topics), and\u00a0different perspectives when reading a passage. Use Control-F on the test, and force yourself to find text evidence for each right answer. If there\u2019s no evidence, it\u2019s wrong. Some ppl be saying you have to read a lot to improve (I didn\u2019t really), but I think changing what you look for in a passage is key.\u00a0\n\n**General Prep / Retake Advice**\n\nIt took me a long time to feel well-versed with the test, so make sure you allot enough time to study for it! I was planning to study for 3 months, but I plateaued at 169 for \\~5 months. However, breakthroughs will happen! Take the test only when you feel ready since there\u2019s a retake limit.\n\nOn my 1st LSAT, I was nervous and freaked out on LG. I also burned out from studying \\~4 hours/day in the weeks prior, so my PT scores kept decreasing, and my LSAT score reflected the decrease. Mentally, I think I took it too seriously \u2013 since I had spent many waking hours on the test, the stakes seemed very high.\n\nI had 2 months before retaking the LSAT, and I basically followed this post:\u00a0https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/hje1li/how\\_i\\_got\\_a\\_180\\_on\\_juneflex\\_please\\_dont\\_push/\n\nTo reiterate its basic themes, I highly recommend **going slow, showing love to yourself,** and **valuing quality over quantity.** I did 1 section & blind review (1 hr) for 4 days a week, wrote takeaways on flashcards on the 5th day, and took a PT on the 6th day. I hadn\u2019t done blind review before, but it was so helpful. All in all, I went from studying 20 hrs a week -> 8 hrs a week and improved in PTs and retake.\n\nI recommend doing things that'll help your physical & mental wellbeing, and things that'll make you feel calm before PTs/the test. During my 1st take, I cleared out an entire week just so that I could focus on LSAT. This backfired because I thought about the LSAT all the time and was stressed. For my 2nd take, I lived life normally and scheduled calls with friends, watched BTS, etc. I also incorporated prayer, meditation, and exercise into my life to help my mental state. I knew I would do better on the LSAT in a calm state, so I tried treating it like a normal PT. You\u2019re allowed to wait before pressing \u201cBegin\u201d on Section 1, so I recommend taking deep breaths & feeling ready before pressing it.\u00a0\n\nThat was long. Feel free to ask any questions and good luck everyone! :)\u00a0"

I feel like I'm missing out on something big, and the thought of me creating something that I can really be proud of is there. I've tried different endeavours but I'm just not there. Although I'm not skilled enough I've done dancing for 3-4 years where I believe I have created some identity around it. I have this huge creative itch that needs to be scratched. The thought of pursing dancing or something artistic has always been a dream of mine since I could leave a level of impact in people's life. I know that I wont be the best dancer which is obvious given the fact that there are kids training from the age of 4. But I'm currently 18 and in the next 7-8 years believe I can create something meaningful. \nBut I'm afraid. \nI don't know what my future will entail. I'm worried about financial stability and not having the feeling of getting control over myself and my situation. From the bullying that I've received from my highschool I've internalized some shame or hatred around it, that I'm just cringe. When someone asks me what it is that I want to do after highschool I always tell them 'other' than a dance choreographer because I'm afraid of what they will say or think. \nThen the other problem is that it feels really awkward to ask my parents my financial support, although according to them they are willing to support me in whatever I do. ( They still suggest I do college because it's hard to make a career/get paid). I think about what I could do. As long as I get paid enough money to pay for my living wants. I could be paid slightly below the average pay and I'll still work for 8-10 hours on this (could be an overestimation of my ability since I've never tried). \nI want to try different things such as cinematography but I'm never there fully. There is always this fear of not pursuing dancing because I feel like I'll be miserable without it. I haven't danced for a while because   of this fear. I've never fallen in love with a conceptual process so badly before. It's not the physical aspect that drives me. But looking at my physical skill it was never that good. Now I'm at a stage questioning whether I truly liked dancing or just driven by wanting to do something meaningful or the fear of missing out. How would you respond to my situation? What am I experiencing that I haven't fully understood? How should I overcome this? These are the same questions I ask myself but find it incredibly difficult to get answer to. How can I move on if at all?"

She didn't look like a man, she had masculine qualities, but I wasn't attracted to her sexually, it was purely energetic and a crush on her vibe. Towards the end of the crush, I did start to become attracted to her physically, but I left the job that I was working at and that went away. In many ways, it was similar to the crushes I've had on men. I tend to be attracted to androgyny in people, all of the men that I am attracted to have quite a bit of feminine qualities.

With the age of the internet, it's easy to get into the mode of self-diagnosis, whether it be for physical or mental illness. But, I feel emotionally struck by this, it's not a fun thing or something that feels relatable, it strikes me to the core and I don't want it to. I don't want this to be the reality, but it resonates so much more than social anxiety disorder ever did. I'm not saying that a feeling is an indicator of the truth, but I've read a lot about it and continuously have tried to think of ways in which I may not, but it fits so well. Beyond on the symptoms, I've dung into the roots, the commo thought patterns, behaviors, etc. It's not something I feel will pull me down or become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because as painful as it's been to learn about, it's something I feel refreshed by, in having language to explain my experiences and perception of myself. I thought I was self aware before, but I had a lot of false beliefs and I also have a tendency to detach from my unhealthy and hurtful behaviors."

I'm only 24 years old, it makes me feel very insecure and I'm afraid it's only gonna keep getting worse. I'm seeing a doctor, but the last time I saw him, I told him I have health anxiety relating to another issue, and I didn't bring up the hair loss, cause I just assumed it was due to stress and nutrition issues cause I have IBS. But, I don't think that anymore, only that it is a contributing factor. I'm less anxious and stressed that I was in college and there are people with way worse anxiety than me who don't have this problem. I just hope he doesn't think it's due to anxiety. I'm going to show him pictures of what it used to look like so he knows I'm not exaggerating, but even just by the appearance alone, it doesn't look like a normal amount of thinness for even those with thin hair.\n\n In the meantime, I'm during various things like taking certain supplements, being very gentle with it, etc. I have always washed it every 3 days in lukewarm water, which I'm continuing to do. I'm not gonna dye for a long time though, last time was in October, and it got even worse since then. But, I only dye my hair like once a year, compared to when I was in high school and in my first year of college, which was 2 sometimes 3x a year, maintaining black using box dye. The texture isn't as wavy as it used to be either, it's quite straight, even though I use curly hair products, cause I live with my parents and my mom has curly hair, and they don't contain harsh chemicals. Are there are any good oils or products that help maintain hair health? I don't use anything but shampoo and conditioner. I used castor oil in 2021, but it took so much conditioner to get of my hair, and I would still sometimes feel it in my hair after showering. I didn't want to do it often enough for that reason, so I never saw the potential benefits of it."

He was sincere and it felt so natural to talk to him. But, everything was ruined when my dream took off into an unrealistic direction in which he was no longer himself, he aged 20 years, but then at one point he was only 17 and way too young for me, and then at one point he was a giant and wanted a girl who was taller. At one point, he was transferred to an alternative dimension in the Nightmare Before Christmas world, in which I followed and became Sally and he was Jack, but I didn't want to be stuck there. It was all a distraction from anything going anywhere, beyond the usual dream shenanigans, it felt like my fears took over and decided to create problems to mess with any potential for an actual romance. It did mimic real life, in that I can have a good encounter with someone, but never repeat that again, fearing getting close to someone."

For two whole weeks I was great, life was amazing, I felt so healthy, but a few days ago, a post-Covid symptom appeared: Phantosmia. Basically it\u2019s where your body picks a scent and that is all you can smell and taste for an extended period of time. Granted, I never lost my smell, just this. Now which smell did I get? Beachy Waves? Earthy Lavender? NOPE! I wouldn\u2019t be writing this if it was a Yankee Candle-type smell. It\u2019s Shepard\u2019s Pie. All I smell is Shepard\u2019s pie. That\u2019s meat and potatoes in my nostrils at all times. And, even worse, since smell has a lot to do with taste, whatever I eat tasted like the food mixed with Shepard\u2019s Pie. Water is literally meat flavored. Ok, enough with the complaining I know, but I\u2019m honestly really fascinated by this. The fact that the smell in my nose is Shepard\u2019s Pie is insane.

I hop in the shower, just as always. I did the usually, body wash, legs, done; but, because of aforementioned idiocy, I decided to wash the bottoms of my feet. What could go wrong? I stood on one foot, and washed the other. Everything went perfect, peachy, hunky-dory, whatever you wanna call it. That was, until, I moved on to the second foot. Jeez, I don\u2019t even know what I did, but my washed foot was on the part of the bath without a mat, so when I went to wash the second foot, I slipped. I felt the weight of me come down, and I bumped my head against the side of the tub, while seeing a flash of green in my eyes. My dad came rushing in (I was in a towel at this point), and called my mom to come home. Due to the current COVID situation, I couldn\u2019t go to any medical professionals, but my mom, being a nurse, said I most likely have a minor concussion. Fun. Craziest part of the story? I don\u2019t remember where I hit. I thought it was my jaw but I had a bump on my temple. Moral of the story, SIT DOWN WHEN YOU WASH YOUR FEET!\n\n\ntl;dr, I washed the bottoms of my feet in the shower, fell, and now have a minor concussion."

I think I've seen a browser extension for keeping unsubmitted form data, but that was several years ago and I never tried it. I think it was called something like \"Lazarus form recovery\"?\n\n> Old Reddit works but I need a dark background because of my chronic migraine\n\nThe \"Dark Reader\" add-on usually does pretty well at dark mode for arbitrary websites. It should be available on all/most Gecko-based (Firefox, etc) and Blink-based (Chrome/Chromium, Edge, Opera, etc) browsers, at least on \"computer\"/\"desktop\"/\"laptop\"; for mobile (Android, at least), Firefox may be the only option. \n\n>I know the ideal is to possibly make into (US) law certain things for online behavior but there are still the nations that you can't keep out that are deliberately not just breaking the rules and taking advantage\n\nA national (US) law would apply to all sites/platforms that wish to do business in the US, which is almost everything in English also a lot of sites in significant minority languages (Spanish, French, \u2026). Then consider sites and platforms that refuse to recognize US law. I hear that some countries (UK and Australia, IIRC) have laws requiring ISPs to block domain names of such sites at the DNS level, meaning anyone who tries to go to the site will at minimum need to be tech savvy enough to change their DNS settings, which is at least enough to keep out the most ignorant / intellectually-lazy recruitment targets that extremists aim for. \n\n>And another problem with that is \"here\" is inside the house. The US has become extremely corrupted by greed and by politicians looking after their own self interest well above that of the citizens.\n\nIn theory, that's what progressive taxation is for\u2026\n\n>And this whole \"taxes are bad\" thing,\n\nAlso \"money is speech\" and \"corporations are people\" extending [1A protections to \u2026 billionaires anonymously funding super-PACs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC) to spread propaganda that supports [zero-sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) or worse policies. \n\n>(and yes this is relevant bear with me here). \n\n>And the brainwashing extends to making words that conflict with that like \"social justice warrior\" or \"woke\" as a pejorative. Think about how stupid that is, that accepting people as they are or wanting accountability for corporations who are poisoning the environment or hurting citizens be accountable in a climate crisis as a pejorative? I mean yeah chasing clout is obnoxious but every movement needs spokes people. \n\nYep! That's why any effective person or group with publicly is subject to extra attacks. Just look at the ridiculous amount of effort that's gone into insulting Greta Thunberg. \n\n>The internet has made being kind and good a bad thing. We need to stop catering to the mindset of teenage bullies.\n\nAgreed, but good luck enforcing \u2026",

That's no excuse for keeping the status quo here. Even US-centric legislation applied only to US-based companies would apply to Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and likely others. If effective legislation is possible, then enacting it here will still cut out a significant fraction of stochastic terrorism. \n\n>The thing is though even if it's law, there's simply no way to enforce it since it's so easy to get past any barrier. \n\nIt'll never be perfect, even if every country was in full agreement.

It looks like content isn't very well monitored in general, which hints at a lack of staffing on Reddit's content moderation team. This is probably a general cost tradeoff for Reddit, since human thought for moderating content is much more expensive than servers for hosting it. \n\n>Personally \"social justice warrior\" is only derogatory to edgy edgeboys with low self esteem. We should be caring about social issues. Only fascists and far right could manipulate people into thinking that is a bad thing. Free speech warrior does seem pretty cringe though.\n\nI've read that SJW *used to* mean someone who makes symbolic empty gestures for clout while doing nothing about (or sometimes even worsening) the problems they claim to care about. Since then it's been used by said edgelords to mean anyone who cares, no matter how sincerely, because caring about shit is apparently somehow wrong to them. Similarly, caring about free speech is also good, but if someone's response to nonviolent self expression (e.g., \"we're queer and we're here\" or anything else associated with the currently fashionable scapegoat that fascists are blaming shit on) is to say \"[scapegoat demographic] shouldn't feel safe\" or otherwise inciting/glorifying/normalizing violence; then they don't really care so much about free speech, no matter how many times they say those words as their justification.",

I mean that's obviously above my pay grade and not something I'm an expert in and there's no easy answer for. I don't think they do enough. In r/help there often people asking for help that a sub has opened up of revenge pron or otherwise images of someone posted without permission and they are asking what to do since the admins haven't been helping. I think they need to rein it in more. If it were up to me I'd eliminate porn, not out of prudishness or \"what somebody think of the children\" (both common straw men about that topic) but that it sets a precedent of negative behavior and abuse and entitlement to vulnerable people (aka useful idiots).\n\nReddit [already prohibits involuntary pornography](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513411) and has [a page for how to report it](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513951-What-should-I-do-if-someone-has-shared-or-threatened-to-share-intimate-images-of-me-or-somebody-I-know-). I disagree about banning *all* porn, but that's beside the point, which is about how to extend whatever moderation ideal into enforceable law. \n\nMy point is: How would the federal government make a law (subject to the First Amendment) that forces Reddit (or any other social media site) to moderate better? How would you legally make it so that if a platform \"hosts speech that leads to violence\" then it's \"held responsible\"? Or do you suggest doing so via non-governmental means, like social pressure, negative publicity and boycotts?",

                "body": "Commenting on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/furgonomics/comments/satwap/how_would_winter_clothing_work_for_large_tailed/) on r/furgonomics, I figure that tail warmers would be a thing for large-tailed species, and the warmers would likely attach to pants / coats\u00b9 to stay snug and warm at the base. The problem is *how* should they attach?\n\nIRL, the most common inter-garment compatibility concern is probably if a belt fits through the loops on some pants, and that's almost never an issue if you don't have particularly wide belts. So compatibility is trivial, and the only standardization is an informal \"belt loops are wider than belts\". Everything else seems to be about tucking and layering, which yields even more trivial compatibility.\n\nTails are much more complex to design for, especially large tails. Given that the tail's base goes right between the butt cheeks, modesty dictates that pants (and underwear) must already be designed around tails. (I think there's a thread about that on one of these subs.) So it makes sense that pants would also be designed to accommodate tail warmers, such as by having attachment points for the warmers.\n\nThe problem is how to use the best fastener possible while ensuring compatibility with the tail warmer that's meant to attach there. Things like velcro and belt loops are easily compatible, but respectively less rugged and more awkward when attaching to another garment. Instead, I think snaps are the ideal fastener for attaching a tail warmer to one's pants.\n\nHowever, snaps IRL are almost universally for use *within* a given garment instead of *between* and connecting garments which could be made by different companies. Thus there would need to be some standardization so a typical anthro will find that their tail warmers work with their pants.\n\nPersonally, for example, I'd standardize the snaps as follows:\n\n- Placement: Place one snap at the top, and other snaps evenly spaced around, having a total of 7 snaps.\n- Size: Define a baseline \"0\" size and multiply diameter by integer powers of sqrt(2) to define other sizes. So a size \"+1\" snap is twice as wide as \"-1\" and \"+5\" is 2^2.5 times wider than \"0\". (Leave exact labelling to the marketing people; it's the physical size that matters.) Have proportional tail cross section circumference sizes, so snaps are proportional. Extra rugged clothes might go up on snap size (e.g., a \"-2 rugged\" or \"-2/-1\" size uses -1 size snaps for a -2 size tail) and lighter/fancier may go down (e.g., \"-2 light\" = \"-2/-3\" and \"+5 light\" = \"+5/+4\"), but most clothes would have similar snap/circumference proportions.\n- Gender: The pants use \"male\" snaps (protruding) facing outward and the tail warmers use \"female\" snaps (concave) facing inward.\n\nAny given anthro would mostly stick to a given size, so things would just fit together. Half and quarter sizes would be more form fitting for those who wish to go out of their way, but integer sizes would be close enough for most uses.\n\nThe problem is my standardization has several kinda arbitrary features, so someone else could easily make an incompatible standard. For example, a \"metric\" size 0 could be 1cm snap diameter while \"imperial\" is 1in. Then to make a new metric garment fit an old imperial garment, you'd need to go `log_s(2.54) = log(2.54) / log(s) \u2248 2.69` sizes up, where `s = sqrt(2) = 2^0.5`. With standard sizes, the closest would be going up to the nearest quarter size, so 2.75 sizes higher; but that's still off by about 2.2%. With half sizes, you'd go only 2.5 higher, but that's a 7% error!\n\nIgnoring the nontrivial combinatorics of other ways for standards to disagree, this may already be too much for cross-system snap compatibility. At the very least, the 2.2% error is probably enough to make the snaps fit noticeably worse.\n\n\u00b9 ^(A trenchcoat, for example, could split near the base of the tail and wrap around. This would cover the tail-specific part of pants and would this require its own tail warmer connections if the coat doesn't go over that too. For simplicity, I use pants as the garment the tail warmer attaches to. Similarly, I'm ignoring other garment-garment attachment possibilities, like wing covers attaching to vests.)\n\n#\n\nHow would *you* try standardizing connections between tail warmers and winter pants / coats? Different fastener types? Multiple snap sizes on the same garment? Different clothing design entirely?"

They're just humans but more \"fantastical\". That works for Tolkien's theme of the passing of the magical past, fading into an age of humans, but I'm not sure how well that same idea can be captured when you have elven characters that need to share the same amount of spotlight as any human characters. The level caps for elves from earlier editions sort of are able to reinforce that theme, but they're not exactly inline with the design of 5e and take a lot player buy-in.",

Is there something else I'm missing?\n\nEDIT: To clarify: yes, I know I can just remove Elves.

I never gave them attitude and always accepted their calls. I followed all the rules under my mother's roof and called my father every night before bed so he wouldn't cry (I wish this was an exaggeration. It's not).\n\nI get along with my siblings decently enough. But we just don't have any similar interests. My brothers are both very \"macho:\" sports and cars and women. Not to be \"that nerdy guy\" but I've always preferred to be indoors doing techie nerd things and rarely raise my voice the way they do.\n\nHonestly... my family stresses me out. They're loud and proud of it. They're all good people but they've never respected my boundaries and I'm really just sick of it. There is also a rocky history of physical/verbal abuse with my parents that has left me with some mental health issues and a larger therapy bill that I'll admit.\n\nMy father sent me a long email guilt-tripping me today. He told me that family should always come first. That I was being a snob and didn't respect my family. I do respect my family. I love my family I just don't... like any of them. Not as people. But I guess that's not the norm and I feel like crap for it now. Not sure if he's being a drama queen again or if I'm actually in the wrong this time.\n\nSo...

Every year--without fail--I have a huge display: colored flood lights, animatronics, projections, fog, etc. I've always had a, 'if you build it, they will come' mentality. I even give out full size candy bars, vampire fangs, spider rings and light up bracelets. I have the biggest display and best treats in the neighborhood by far, and that's not conceit: most other folks just flip their lights on and maybe carve a pumpkin.\n\nGuys, this year I had maybe 6 trick-or-treaters. Which is honestly more than I've gotten previous years, but it's 7:30p on Halloween night and I haven't seen a kid in nearly an hour. Granted, I'm happy to sit outside in costume on a beautiful October night sipping tea in my graveyard, but it's such a bummer to put in so much effort and have no kids come around to enjoy it.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this? What do you do? Has anyone been able to turn it around, or have any tips?  I don't want to give up, but it's so deflating."

They play a full caster class and really have a hard time understanding spellcasting in particular. I was trying to help them level their character recently, and in figuring out how many new spells they could know, showed them the table in the PHB.\n\nI tried explaining it a few times, walked them through how to read the table and after 10-15 minutes of this, they got frustrated and gave up. They let other party members make big character decisions for them, and don't understand what they've got in their arsenal at any given moment. Obviously, this really negatively effects gameplay, because when asked what their character does in combat, it takes a very long time and suggestions/offers of help just frustrate them. So by the end of the session, it's usually just, 'yeah, whatever, I do that'. I'm a more 'flavor over mechanics' person in general, but they don't have much of that either: they let other players completely make their character and don't seem to have a good understanding of who their character is, which makes roleplay flat as well.\n\nIt's a bummer because this campaign was their idea in the first place. The DM is aware, and tries to give them opportunities to use their skills, but they don't even know what they are, so they miss a lot of them. This also leads to our That Guy jumping in and doing everything, because we're trying to give them time to solve the problem, and he takes advantage of that. We are several sessions in and they still don't understand class level vs. casting level; prepared vs known spells; spell slots, etc. They do a little better with other things, but still struggle mightily with very basic concepts (like AC and HP, and using ability modifiers).\n\nShould we encourage them to take levels in a martial class, since that seems to be what they understand/like best? Keep trying? Have the DM have a side conversation about understanding their character's abilities?\n\nThis post was partially spurred by another thread here, talking about how hard it is to run a game where someone doesn't know their character. Our DM is great (but brand new to it), so I'd love to hear how you'd handle this at your table."

Self-loathing is detrimental and so difficult to escape.\n\nWhere did it all go wrong? Probably when I had the gall to attend college in London, England, instead of here in my \"home country\" of the US. Boy they do NOT like it if you went somewhere else unless it was bloody Oxford (it wasn't). \n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, of course I had to go and be stupid and fall in love with some Dutch charmer who convinced me we would be together forever so why don't you move to the Netherlands after graduation? OKAY SURE. So I went and did that. Got a Master's Degree in the Netherlands because why not, but that was stupid because now I have a degree from some other \"foreign country\" which American companies are distrustful of. Unless it's Oxford.\n\nSo. MA obtained. How useless it is. Suddenly I am \"overqualified\" for things I was applying for but still \"underqualified\" due to lack of experience because, oh yeah, I was one of those LAZY idiots who didn't do internships because, you know, \"I'll just go with the flow, whatever, it'll all work out. I'm in love, nothing else matters.\" I hate me.\n\nSuddenly I move back to the US because my visa runs out. Get a job quickly as a temp. Something stable that could possibly become permanent, so of course I try and figure out a way to ruin it. How? Oh, well, the love of my life gets this wonderful job so he can support us both so why don't I come back over and stay with him on a relationship visa? OKAY SURE.\n\nMove to NL. Great. This is great. I get to pursue my dream of authorship and work on my book(s) and travel and be in love and wow I'm in Europe, isn't life grand?\n\nTwo years later. \"Love of my life\" no longer finds me to be the love of his and can't take the responsibility of a relationship visa anymore and would rather schtup his 20 year old intern because I guess, at 26, I was suddenly too old for his boyish sensibilities. He claimed he wanted to be \"free\" to explore all the opportunities of his blossoming career without having to take anyone else into consideration. But I'm thinking it was mostly just the intern.\n\nBack to the US. To North Carolina, where my sister is, because there will be less competition than California, I thought. Precious 26 year old me forgot that North Carolina has like a million universities within 10 miles of each other so the graduate competition is fierce.\n\nSo here I am. A pathetic 27 year old with less than one year of proper work experience who's been living in NC for six months and cannot find a job. Six months of applying and I can't even snag myself a retail job. \n\nI hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself. I don't know what the hell I'm going to do or how I'm going to get out of this. I was supposed to be more than this by now. I am nothing and it hurts.\n\nMoral of the story: DON'T DO IT. DO NOT FOLLOW YOUR HEART. Your heart is stupid and it will lie to you. Ignore the fluffy love stuff the media throws out at you. The love you have with your SO is not unique and will most likely not stand the test of time. Let it be a piece of you, not all of you.\n\nMake something of yourself. Early. Don't fall prey to love traps. Hold on tight to your ambition.\n\nNever, never, NEVER put yourself in the position of being dependent on someone else. Especially if he's tall, charismatic and too handsome for his own good. Such a specimen cannot be trusted.\n\n\nSo much regret. I don't know how I will get out of this. Online job applications filter me out, emails to HR are most likely deleted, and any I send in the mail are chucked in the trash, I'm sure. \n\nI am sad. I am broken. I did everything wrong in the eyes of society in terms of education and work experience... which is all that matters in order to solidify a place in said society. \n\nAt least I have my cat. "

Waking up is painful. In real life I'm doing okay, but those dreams reopen wounds I'm trying to heal. \n\nWhat's weirder is that during the entire time we were together, I never had a good dream about us. All my dreams with him in them had to do with him rejecting me, cheating on me, and in one peculiar instance wrapping me in a sail and tossing me overboard. He was never cruel to me in real life, by the way, and the break up is amicable. \n\nIs there any way to stop this?

Caffeine or meds calm my mind too but in a sense that it sharpens my attention and executive functions. Smoking though makes me heady and sort of less physically present if that makes sense, when i take a step it feels like half floating, my movements feel hazy etc. This feeling is the strongest when you first start smoking or when you drop it for a while and also slightly for the first cigarette in the morning then fades away as u smoke more durung the day bc hours past during sleep. The thing is u get used it over time and smoking was nothing more than a fidget for me for the past months with no physical effect present. With ritalin, it all came back suddenly and it happens every time. Im not quite sure anout the neurochemistry behind this, but it sure feels different than other stimulants.",

These don\u2019t effect mechanics, just for cosmetic reasons like a farmer origined spell caster can cast Magic Missile that look like chickens floating. Google \u201cmagic theme table tasha\u201d for a better understanding. Lets build a d100 table for these kinds of magic themes:\n\n## d100 Magic Themes (100/100)\n\n1. Various kinds of snakes and serpent patterns accompanied by a hissing sound.\n\n2. Skulls, skeletons, gravestones, gargoyles and ravens with dark gray and violet colors accompanied by a scent of decay.\n\n3. Faces of personas from all ages, races, genders and backgrounds with a fading scream sound.\n\n4. Axes, logs, carved wood, dry leaves or charcoal and ash accompanied by the scent of freshly cut wood or smoke.\n\n5. Bees... everywhere. Stings, honey, beeswax, honeycomb with yellow and black colors accompanied by a sweet sweet smell.\n\n6. Duck themed: spells with sounds are always quacks and all spells look a bit duck shaped. /u/ArcaneSpellbook\n\n7. For a bard\u2019s interpretation: hard rock laser show. /u/ArcaneSpellbook\n\n8. A chaotic messy theme with lots of clashing colors and harsh sounds. /u/ArcaneSpellbook\n\n9. Symbiotic oozes of various colours and forms appears and turns into desired spells of yours.\n\n10. Bubbles. The bubbles can assemble to create things, things disappear in a myriad of bubbles, circle around your target for non-damage spells, popping bubbles for AOE. /u/IkaTheFox\n\n11. Around a single monochromatic animal. Choose a colour and an animal. Using your magic makes tiny versions of that animal appearing around you, gather around your target, or assemble to create new things. Everything dispels by bursting into these little monochromatic animals. They can even make soft sounds or chimes when moving. /u/IkaTheFox\n \n12. Thin smoke and fog that does not obscure vision. Typically in the form of spirals, waves, balls or vaguely straight lines. /u/IkaTheFox\n\n13. Negative. The spells just make the world behind them look like it's negative. /u/SevenHassall\n\n14. Candy land. Everything is sticky sweet. Ropes of licorice. Cotton Candy fog. Syrup goo on the floor. Fireballs flavored with cinnamon (atomic fireballs). Everything is candy. Willy Wonka style. /u/PutridMeatPuppet\n\n15. Offerings: Scattered across your body are offerings to different spirits of the land. With a short phrase, you toss an offering into the air, where a small spirit manifests and catches it. It glows brightly as it consumes the offering, then dashes to the spell target to create the effect. The spirit itself may let out an excited yelp. /u/CoolNerdStuff\n\n16. Glass spheres. Every spell starts as a glass sphere being palmed, juggled, thrown, rolled or shattered. /u/wyverndarkblood\n\n17. Orbital Crystals: All magic is cast from crystals that float near you. Spells cast look a lot like a bullet hell game. You can even flavor the projectiles to be crystal themed. /u/Random_Jojo\n\n18. Blades. From daggers to greatswords, falchions to scimitars, bastardswords to fruit knives accompanied by metallic slashing sounds.\n\n19. Traveler. Horses, carts, horseshoes, bags, boots and anything related to traveling with the noise of a cart and the excitement of traveling.\n\n20. Blood. Bloody shapes ranging from shades of red accompanied by the sharp scent of iron.\n\n21. A hammer and an anvil forging, iron and lava colors with the sound of the hammer.\n\n22. Fireworks. Everything whistles and fizzles, ending in a shower of colorful sparks. /u/bardicly-inclined\n\n23. Holographic spell screen that is scrolled to pick a spell and makes a notification sound when a spell is casted.\n\n24. Spellslinger smoking pipe: puff smoke for illusions, conjuration, divinations Deep breath for fire spells as the herbs embers. /u/Ghepip\n\n25. Fisherman that uses a fishing rod as his quarterstaff/spell focus, everything is either mist, fog, water, waves. Conjuration could be sea creatures. /u/Ghepip\n\n26. Farmer where everything is what his favorite pet/animal was associated with. /u/Ghepip\n\n27. Bard, but he is more into poems and not music. So his magic manifests as the sentences of his poems Healing spells would be the literal sentences of love letters that sew together the slashing wound or surround bludgeon/piercing wounds. /u/Ghepip\n\n28. Shadow sorcerer, where the source of the magic isn't you, but the nearest shadow. The bigger spell the bigger shadow. The shadows could temporary warp away and become the spell, and then return shortly after. /u/Ghepip\n\n29. Breathing practices and controlling the blood flow by that, various inhaling and exhaling techniques accompanied by a bunch of yoga moves.\n\n30. You have a sketchbook and bunch of colorful pencils, you draw the effect of the spell you want to cast and becomes real as you draw.\n\n31. Climate, weather, earth, flora and fauna of a the caster's honetown inspires the appearence of the spells.\n\n32. One certain color related to caster's appearence dominates the spells.\n\n33. Your spells effect the minds of others, anything you cast has no external visual effect but mentally effect the target.\n\n34. **Mandala\u2019s** that radiate/grow in size and complexity as the spells are cast at higher levels (Magic Missle May form multiple small Mandala\u2019s along the arm or palm that launches like a tiny Artillery shot; Come of Cold could make a Mandala that sprouts from the palm and rotates as it expands and trust from blue to white- once white it projects the cold; Mage Hand could form a Mandala at the caster\u2019s wrist and turn their whole hand purple, the way they move that hand controls the Mage Hand\u2019s movements). /u/FlynnXa\n\n35. **Fungal Growths/Spores** that emanate the desired effect (Acid Bolt conjures a Acidic Mushroom that gets slingshotted at the target by pulling and releasing its stalk; Witch Bolt conjures Staticly Charger Mushrooms on the Targets Limbs that shock them each turn). /u/FlynnXa\n\n36. **Book Casting** so that you could just throw the book at them, read the words from the page which become the projectiles to hit, maybe the words lift from the page and onto a person\u2019s body to enhance or heal them. /u/FlynnXa\n\n37. **Food** so that cauldrons of sips pour spells down overhead, or flaming cookies are flung like disks, and a bread sword gets conjured up to slay a foe. /u/FlynnXa\n\n38. **Mirrors** could be used to shoot spells from their surface, conjure forth entities by using heir reflections, act as shields/barriers, and dispel other spells or more. /u/FlynnXa\n\n39. **Fabrics** could me used to literally weave the spell into its desired form, or to shape enchantments, cursed scarves or knitted bandages that magically heal. /u/FlynnXa\n\n40. **Paint** could be hastily splattered on a spare piece of parchment in the image of the spell and then burned or presented to cast the spell its resembles. /u/FlynnXa\n\n41. Mathematical equations written in the air, numbers, symbols, calculations unique to each spell accompanied by a constant chalk on the blackboard sound.\n\n42.

Opposites - you become warmer when you cast an ice spell, aggressive if you cast a friendship spell, etc. /u/amintowords\n\n44. Elaborate gestures - to cast a spell the player and hence the character has to mime what happens. This could be three flicks of the finger for a magic missile, or a slow wavy dance for a fog related spell. /u/amintowords\n\n45. The red glowing energy of the spell originates from the ground at the caster\u2019s feet, flows up through the body, then emanates from the caster\u2019s hands. Dirt, dust clouds, or small rocks are left behind after a spell ends. The caster\u2019s hands are caked in dirt after casting a spell. /u/SayethWeAll\n\n46. Minerals and types of stone (ores, gems, ect.) that act as a foci for spells based on the materials characteristics.  For example, hematite for rusting grasp, pyrite for enchantments made to deceive, cinnabar for poison based spells, micas for glitterstorm or heat resistance, or galena for spells that make things denser. /u/supersnes1\n\n47. Spellcraft cards where the hand being played dictates the spell and its potency.  Practitioners experienced in this style eventually learn to stack the deck in their favor. /u/supersnes1\n\n48. Scents (perfumes, flowers, cooking food,  brimstone, refuse, oral, ect.) accompany and drive the spells. /u/supersnes1\n\n49. Puppets (string, finger, sock, ect.)  are made to enact a scene or conduct the verbal and somatic components of the spell. /u/supersnes1\n\n50. The Big One. Whether you're a human with a huge crystal ball or a gnome with a normal one, you gotta carry that thing above your head in two hands. You have it up to cast spells and it glows very dramatically. /u/TheMightyFishBus\n\n51. Thinking With Portals. You use magic portals to essentially summon the effects of your spells from other planes, rather than casting them traditionally. 'Well your honour, technically I didn't cast fireball. I just opened up a rift in space time that a fireball *happed* to come out of.'. /u/TheMightyFishBus\n\n52. Spells are flavored to essentially be a kobold inventor\u2019s attacks. Dancing lights are fireflies kept in a jar, poison spray is a skunk in a cage, absorb elements is catching the attack in an iron pot. Fabricate is a bunch of ants working really fast, blur is a flower that makes those who smell it see double, and jump is just makeshift spring boots. /u/bao-and-boba\n\n53. Perform tribal kobold dances and recite ancient draconic poetry and hymns and the magic takes effect. /u/bao-and-boba\n\n54. Barbarian Rage.

This NPC was a plain Elven Rogue, black clothes, daggers etc. I didnt overplanned him bc he was supposed to be a one time NPC.\n\n Second session, i gave my player a main goal that requires months of travel and until she reaches that point many adventure will happen. Suddenly she asked this NPC to come with her for backup, i was very happily surprised that she thought of this, it felt like she is learning the game and she is eager. Also we are just me and her playing so i thought an NPC with her side would be helpful. So NPC said sure why not where are we going.\n\n First and foremost i dont have anything cool for this NPC yet, he is nothing special and since i didnt have that kind of preparation i cant roleplay him. I will create a rogue like i am creating a character for myself but I wonder your rogue NPCs or how would you handle that kind of situation? \n\nTL;DR: How would you turn a plain Elven rogue NPC who has black clothes and throws daggers, into the greatest travel companion for your only player?"

What are some effects of poison as a psychedelic substance?\n\n On the internet it just says it is bitter and kind of similar to almond but think about it when someone drinks alcohol for the first time it is just bitter, burning... But as you get used to it you can taste the different aromas of different kind of alcoholic beverages.\n\nTL;DR: So how would poison taste like for a \"poisonaholic\" Yuan Ti and how it affect the body?

If you're directly cropping other people's artwork into your work flow, and your client picks a sketch that has someone else's art directly in it, what do you do?

But your client asked for that specific composition, and wants you to make it look like the \"sketch\" that you compiled. This comes into a precarious territory in my opinion. Thumbnail value sketches are supposed to be quick and minimal but still get the gist of what the composition is going to be. Using other people's fully rendered art for this step is setting yourself up to plagiarize either accidentally or purposely. I find it disingenuous at its best, and plagiarism at its worst. If I, or anyone did this at my art school for our preliminary sketches even, they would consider disciplinary action because plagiarism at any level in the art world is no joke.",

I've literally been able to train an Iguana so I figured, hey cats are more intelligent, maybe they are trainable? Well I learned the truth the hard way.\n\nI adopted two adult cats back in February. They don't have a mean bone in their body but I really learned the definition of an opportunistic pet now. One is special needs and wears multiple articles of clothing to prevent him from eating his own skin off. My other cat is just extremely food motivated. Well, now the other one learned that behavior and they are both existing purely for food. They eat all my plants everyday, open my cabinets and pull all the food out and eat it while we are sleeping, and will even DIVE US for whatever we are eating. I work from home and I have to monitor them every day, and they are just always getting into shit, and my ADHD makes it so hard to get back to work. Our sink has to be spotless or they will overturn and lick every dish. They puke exclusively on carpet only. \n\nAnd the worst part -- NO PUNISHMENTS WORK. Positive or negative reinforcement is useless. I've tried spray bottle, scruffing and saying a firm NO, even putting them in bathroom time out. Even giving them positive affirmation after listening to \"no\" just trains them to do bad things for my attention. They have toys everywhere, I give them playtime. They have premium food and probably eat more than they should. They have no reason to be causing havoc, but it doesn't matter because it seems cats do not need a reason. They just do.\n\nMy cat loving friends all think that if you don't love your cats like a child, you are a bad person. And I love them, but like a parent would still love their child that they regret. I'll never take them to a shelter or give them away, my guilt will not permit me to. So I will be caring them for the next 15 years or so. But if I knew this was going to happen I would have just gotten a dog or another reptile. \n\nIf you guys have any tips, I'm all ears. I have just exhausted the internet resources available and they all conclude: cats will keep doing what they want so adjust your own behavior. Guess it means I have to give up all my human luxuries for animals that only view me as a source of sustenance they can manipulate.\n\nI'm happy to have found this community, I would be verbally annihilated anywhere else for expressing my struggles with these cats."

In the beginning, you'll get many things wrong and you'll be subject to the **Dunning-Kruger Effect** many many times. You'll think you have figured everything out, then suddenly realize you haven't even gotten to the basics. It's perfectly normal. **Keep going** OP, until you know everything inside out. You'll eventually get there. Especially, even though it's possible to make a website by using only Html, CSS and javascript, ain't nobody got time for that. We use javascript frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, etc. that make the job so much easier and practical. Each has its own pros and cons. I'd recommend you learn the basics about some of them after learning some Javascript (There is a very resourceful and funny youtube channel called '**Fireship**'. You won't understand the videos at the beginning but at least you'll have a good laugh). Until then, play around with some Html.  Good Luck! So go with -> **1. Html 2. CSS 3. Javascript 4. Some Framework**",

                "body": "In the past two years, my self-esteem skyrocketed WITHOUT me reaching all my goals (yet).\n\n(I am 24 years old.)\n\nI have to add to this, I do think I have a naturally beautiful face so that helps, but even a beautiful face is not always enough if you do NOT take proper care of yourself.\n\n*(Another reason why I love Dita Von Teese! She has an arguably average face, but people perceive her as this otherworldy bombshell because of all the magic she creates with makeup, styling, and taking care of herself.)*\n\nSo this is how I basically went from feeling ignored and insecure to feeling like an actual lite version of a bombshell. I receive compliments over compliments and men try to get with me or ask me out. And keep in mind, I am NOT ideal yet:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Hair:** I grew my hair out and take good care of it. I added some highlights to it (e-girl inspired). My hair was my biggest failo as I had bleachdamanged it and went from hip-length to a ratty chin-length cut. It has been growing for the past 2 years, and it legitimately helped me.\n* **Body/Style:** I figured out my Kibbe bodytype and essence. I am a Romantic with an Ingenue face, so I stick to clothing that flatters my body and essence. There were times where a chubby hourglass-shaped girl like me was trying to copy Bella Hadid, who is the complete opposite of me--very tall and skinny. I still have some weight to lose, but I started to learn how to dress for my body. For example, I am not at an ideal weight for my height, but I have feminine curves and a smaller waist, so I wear tailored dresses in summer that flatter my shape.\n* **Skin:** I started taking better care of my skin, going in for a monthly facial. Sure, I do not have a perfect beauty routine (yet), but I remove my makeup properly, I use enough moisturiser, I exfoliate, put on sunscreen, and so forth.\n* **Nails:** I get my nails done monthly. Be it acrylic nails or Shellac when my nails need a break--it makes me feel feminine and groomed. Also, do not forget a good pedicure, especially in summer! If you do not wanna spend loads of money, just watch YouTube tutorials and do it at home. It is really not that hard.\n* **Tan:** I embrace my ethnic side and my natural colour palette. For example, I know I look very good when I am tanned because I am skin type 4, so I spend a lot of time at the beach when I can (with proper protection) and make sure I have a healthy tan. But if you are a naturally very pale person, in my opinion, you should try to embrace it because it probably suits you the best. Great example: Dita Von Teese. Likewise, I have seen girls who are between pale and tan, and they look great with a slight glow! Then, there are girls who are dark all year around, and vibrant colours like fuchsia flatter them beautifully! Just figure out what suits you the best, and use that to your advantage!\n* **Makeup:** I finally am confident enough to do the makeup I like and incooperate it in my daily routine. Sure, I cannot and do not want to always do my super fancy festival/rave/date makeup, but my everyday makeup does not have to be compromised because of it. I still like to wear fake lashes or just mascara, use blush, some contour, lipstick and so forth, but I generally tend to skip the eyeliner, the glitter, the gems, and heavy foundation, and I just use some CC cream and concealer. Yet, my makeup is complimented and an eyecatcher without feeling SUPER heavy on my face. Depending on what you like (very minimal makeup, clean girl looks, e-girl styles, etc.), play with that and try to find out what your everyday makeup look should be.\n* **Teeth:** I take care of my teeth. I used to have braces as a kid, so my teeth is mostly straight. I brush them every day and use floss, I get a professional dental cleaning done, and I get it bleached. My teeth is not as perfect as the teeth of a celebrity with veeners, sure, but I take care of it, and it makes me feel good.\n* **Body hair:** Honestly, I suffer from having lots of body hair, so I do a lot of different things. Some hairs I get waxed, some I shave off, and I also get **laser** on different parts of my body to remove them forever (this is the best one you can do, honestly).\n* **Weight/Health/Exercise:** Something I still struggle with because I have still some weight to lose. But I take inspiration from my fit friends and partner, and I even invested in a FitBit, which keeps me on track. It is really easy to fall into a toxic mindset when it comes to dieting, so my best advice is to honestly put your health first and then looks second. From experience, even when my body does not look how I want it to be, I feel the best when I eat healthy without depriving myself of things and eat in moderation and stay active. Personally, I like to calorie-count to lose weight, but I know it is triggering for some, so I think it is on you to know what is best for you! Being healthy makes you prettier!\n* **Brows/Freckles/Lash Extensions + Lift:** Since I have naturally bushy brows and an Ingenue face, I just shape them and do the Korean eyebrows style on me because it suits my face the best. But I know girls who benefitted from getting their eyebrows tattooed (in a realistic way, not the trashy way lol). Maybe that can help some. I also like to do faux-freckles or add beautymarks sometimes. It makes your face more dynamic! And lastly, I was never a fan of lash extensions (I usually use fake lashes), but I know some women who LOVE it for looksmaxxing. Same with an eyelash lift or soap brows. Be not afraid to try it out if you think it could help you. It was not for me, but I felt like I should add this.\n* **Bonus - Lip Fillers:** This is not JUST softmaxxing, but I get lip fillers, and they honestly suit my face, and my partner and other people love it on me. And I obviously love it too. It kind of adds a sensual effect to my face because I have big eyes, rounder/softer features, and now I have full lips (I had somewhat full lips, to begin with, tho). So my actual advice here is to look at your features and determine. Maybe you do not need lip fillers, but you show signs of aging, and it would be smart to get fillers or botox somewhere else. But a warning! Do not OVERDO it, honestly. Filler migrates to other parts of your face, and the overfilled look distracts from your beauty.\n\nLastly, I have some hardmaxxing surgery for my body coming up (and I might post about it if you guys are interested)."

Maybe put it under your pillow and sleep on it (l do this with my tarot cards too) or just keep it on your person during the day. Or when your at home relaxing or meditating, hold it in your hands and let your energy flow through it. There are many different ways choose something that \"feels \" right to you.\n\nIf you work with someone/something (a higher power of some sort)  ask them to help you in your pendulum work, if you want undefined guidance ask \" the universe\"",

(If that's cool with all of you\ud83e\udd27)\n\nI'm the typical reverse Christian. I was born into Christianity (polish/german household) I went to church and always found it boring, but did it anyway. \n\nI learned about the religion but was always questioning it. I tried praying but it didn't work for me. \n\nThen one day in school (I was like 12) we learned about Satan in passing (they didn't really talk about the whole \"hell\" and \"sin\" thing)\n\nI became obsessed with the topic and did my own research. I came to sympathise with \"Satan\"\n\nAnd since praying to God didn't work I went like \"well let's try Satan then\" and talked and prayed to him, and he delivered.\n\nI thought I must be a Satanist, but didn't fully agree with the rules of the \"Church of Satan\". Later one I slid into energy work/witchcraft and  everything seemed to be connected somehow.\n\nThen I stopped praying to him because I wasn't sure if that was \" the right thing to do\" and now I'm slowly learning about the different types of \"Satanism\" and wanting to reconnect.\n\nMy question is, do you people think I might be a luziferian? Are we allowed to call Lucifer \"Satan\" or is there a distinct differentiation between them?\n\nAnd should I be wrong, can you point me in the right direction?\n\nThank you for reading, this turned out longer then I thought it would be!\n\nAlso thank you in advance, from what I read you all seem to be very welcoming and helpful \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: fixed a spelling mistake"

                "body": "This feeling shall pass, like all feelings do. It might take a long while, and it might linger. But in due time you will feel that the understanding you\u2019ve gained about the fragility of life and how it is affected by our choices will make you more carefree than you have ever been before. It\u2019s tough, I know. The severity to life itself, the weight that we must continually carry, day after day... feels borderline cruel. But only through that pain, through that realisation can I now make more deliberate choices than ever before. Now I choose to either be an adult and toughen up or let the kid in me run wild and free. Never feel guilty for feeling childlike. Ever notice the happiest people are the ones who seem to balance responsibility and liberty in their actions effortlessly? It\u2019s a lesson we all have to learn eventually. We do need both if we ever wish to feel like fulfilled individuals. Events like losing a parent accelerate that process of finding out the adult part. It, however, can also open many doors to manifesting a true sense of childlike wonder, for that too is becoming an adult! Realising that life\u2019s too short to be an adult all of the time, maybe we only need to be when the circumstances call for it. Other times we can be like children, making decisions without feeling the immediate weight of the consequences. And don\u2019t you dare feel guilty for doing so! We are only human, after all. \n\nRemember that the way to healing is found by truly making an effort, every single day, to feel what you feel. Thinking about what you feel might help, but only trough feeling what we feel can we truly let go. Talking might help, a walk in nature too. Be kind to yourself and take care \u2764\ufe0f\n\nSending love your way (from a 23 year old who feels your pain)",

I hear a lot that you have to stop searching to find and if you (for example) like athletic women you should (for example!) do something like go climbing regularly.

Yes, some other queens are super fierce and seem to be heavy-hitters in every challenge and category (*cough cough* Sasha Colby *cough cough*). But it\u2019s really up to the fan favorites every time, and some viewers really seem to lack objectivity. When it\u2019s the fan favorites that are top worthy but not the best in a challenge, you are all yelling if she doesn\u2019t win, and when a queen who does really good and win but is not really liked by the fandom, you are all yelling as well that\u2019s it\u2019s unfair, always placing the fan favorites first.\n\nAura is receiving A LOT of hate. The queens don\u2019t have that much screentime (barely not sometimes) and they are surely already super sad with that. Aura won, and honestly she kinda deserved it, and she must be so upset at home watching this, seeing how everyone discredits her and what she did\u2026",

But it's different. Erika was not involved in any pivotal plot points that they had to show up until that point, and while they could've gave her some random scenes of camp life, that wouldn't have been essential to her gameplay arc. Instead, they started to develop her story with the Episode 4 challenge throwing debacle, which was plot relevant but easily could've been skipped over. \n\nWhile a winner can get zero confessionals in an episode, if the winner is not shown when they are relevant to the plot and a key part of a vote, such as Lydia was in Episode 3, they have no chance at winning. Erika's edit is not comparable to Lydia's in any way shape or form-when she was involved in any vote, her name was either mentioned and edited as a strategic mastermind to develop her \"secret lion\" storyline and in each vote she was a part of (which all happened to be post-merge), she got atleast a couple of confessionals that showed that \\*she\\* was in control. In Lydia's near vote out, she didn't even get to say anything, nor was her character developed in anyway by the near vote out. \n\nThere are a few reasons why confessionals are aired: 1) for entertainment value (OTT energy, heroism, villainy, humor), 2) impressive gameplay or strategy/plot relevance, 3) to develop storylines, most prominently the winner. \n\nMoreover, Ika is \\*NOT\\* out of contention simply because they were invisible for one episode. There was no plot relevancy to Ika in this episode. They are not going to shoe-in a random camp life confessional of an Ika winner and take away valuable screen time from a VERY intense tribal. \n\nUsing this model, we can properly hypothesize the greatest chances of winning are: **Omar, Hai** \n\nNext, we have our more UTR winner contenders: **Romeo, Drea, Lindsay**\n\nOther contestants that are not ruled out yet with consistent perspective but is probably just attributed to plot relevant points/OTT energy: **Jonathan, Maryanne, Mike, Tori**\n\nWho is definitely NOT winning: **Chanelle, Rocksroy, Lydia**"

It's gotten to the point where I can't really look up any symptoms without freaking out, or thinking I might have something when it's just anxiety/panic. A few weeks ago I had a numbness all along my right side of my body and thought I might have a stroke until my husband told me that it's the left side of my body that would be affected. Well, I think my brain was like \"Oh? I got the wrong side? Alright, let's do the other one to mess with you!\" and now my left side is feeling numb. My anxiety often manifests as numbness across my body, cold, tingles, etc, so logically I know it's most likely my anxiety but it is still freaking me out.

I tired to correct him multiple times saying \u201cboobs aren\u2019t filled with milk 24/7\u201d and he wouldn\u2019t listen lmao.\n\nI thought the whole thing was over but before we left to go home I pushing myself up on this low wall cos I was bored. Then friend A said \u201cmaybe it\u2019s a good thing your mum doesn\u2019t want u at my house\u201d (reference to past convo). I asked \u201cwtf why?\u201d \n\nThen he pointed at my boobs saying \u201ccos you\u2019re positioned like that and in a milkshake shirt\u201d \n\nI jumped down and probably mumbled something like \u201cfor fucks sake\u201d idk.\n\n\nLater tonight friend B called me \u2018Milkshake girl\u2019 in a chat him, friend A and I r in. I was like ff really? And he said \u201clol sry\u201d and I told him \u201clmao jk it\u2019s fine ( I just didn\u2019t want to make a scene), but seriously I don\u2019t want my nickname to be a boob joke\u201d\n\nThey thought it was funny, pinned the message, and told me that when I\u2019m sad I can look at it,  i said \u201cwhat, so I can feel sad and strange?\u201d\n\nFriend A called me salty af and they both made another joke and proceeded to show friend C the message.\n\n\n\nI just want to know if I\u2019m overreacting or is this just normal guy behaviour. I really don\u2019t like fights or making a scene but I\u2019m going to be uncomfortable if they bring it up again. Ik if I say stop, a whole ordeal might come up and they\u2019ll prolly mention how offended I was over it in later convos.\n\nEdit: friend B started up the jokes again, I privately DMed him saying \u201cenough with the dumb shit\u201d he said \u201cNo\u201d but after a going back and forward a bit I told him that \u201cIk it\u2019s a joke, but I said enough\u201d and it was over. Friend A seems over it, so I\u2019m not gonna ask him about it."

I've calculated my total projected self-employed gross income to be somewhere in the ballpark of $7,500-$8,000 USD if the projects are finished by December and I don't receive any more projects, which currently I don't think I will. After deductions for equipment and other business expenses, the net income is around $6,500 USD. On the IRS instructions sheet ([https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf)) it's saying that if I'm filing as Single and my income is less than  $9,875, then the tax is 10%? I think? (I can never decipher these things) Which means I owe $650 this year, split into two I should send $325? Does this sound right? I was expecting a bigger number.  \n\n\nAnyone more seasoned have advice? I was thinking about hiring someone to help me but I'm not sure the cost would be worth it considering how low my income is"

The only pills I don\u2019t take are the inert iron supplements during the 4th week.  \nI\u2019m not sexually active, I take them for hormonal regulation reasons only.  \nThis month has been weird. I don\u2019t usually have a lot of discharge on the pills but starting from the beginning of month\u2019s pack (from Sunday January 29) I\u2019ve had a lot more. Like, I need to wear a pantyliner now when I didn\u2019t need to before.  \nIt\u2019s not an infection. No smell, no pain, no itching. It\u2019s semi-opaque milky white-yellow and has a sort of jello texture to the touch (but less viscous). It\u2019s normal discharge, there\u2019s just quite a lot more of it than I usually have. I have no clue why.  \nHowever, when I wiped yesterday there was blood on the TP. Still bleeding today, a little bit heavier. My period is almost a week early.  \n\nAnyone know what this could mean hormonally? It feels like these are related somehow because they\u2019re both odd. Has this happened to you before?  \nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything medically wrong with me, I\u2019m not a hypochondriac.

[picture displaying routes](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/410171827705479169/1013553098356170832/IMG_8518.jpg)  \n- the attacking teams only have one real objective: get the most turf inked. getting the ultra signal helps with that and gives them clout, but it\u2019s ultimately to secure more ink. they will *still* get more baseline clout than the defending team even if they don\u2019t bother getting the ultra signal. the defending team has two objectives that cannot happen at the same time: inking the most turf AND ferociously guarding the ultra signal. \n- you can argue that you can split the defending team into 2 players watching the ultra signal and 2 players inking turf, but it\u2019s not uncommon in splatoon for two players to be splatted at a time, ESPECIALLY when 4 others players are headed for the center. also reefslider exists and can, has, and will splat the defending team in the tiny little center. if those two players holding the center are splatted, which will inevitably happen, it all falls apart and the match is essentially over.  \n- as the defending team, you cannot match with randos and expect to win tricolor battles. you need to bring your A-game every single time and be highly coordinated. even a lot of teams of four who were in calls coordinating were losing.  \n- even experienced rank X players on team scissors were getting bodied, so it\u2019s not a skill issue.  \n- as it turns out, mixing turf war and ranked mode isn\u2019t really a good idea.  \n- from a commenter: \u201cthe ultra signal sprinklers could not be turned off once activated, and the ultra signal could be launched way too easily. one reef slider wipes out the defenders, and the ultra signal is captured before you have even respawned. then the sprinkler activates, and you can maybe, just barely, keep up with its ink output if you have a roller... until you run out of ink, and then have to retreat and do it all over again... i worked with another roller, and we were barely able to hold a portion of one side just against the sprinkler.\u201d\n- this is minor but while the rock and paper got shiver and frye talking to them during battle, scissors got nothing. just silence.\n\nif i think of anything more i\u2019ll add it but this is a rundown of why team scissors were getting bombed. also i\u2019m just outlining these issues in one place to compare to if anything changes in the future which it hopefully will.  \n\nhaving 4 players isn\u2019t the advantage it sounds like on paper because you have to split the work of defending the ultra signal and getting the most turf, and those two players holding the signal are inevitably going to be splatted by the 4 offensive players because\u2026 it\u2019s splatoon and that happens especially when players are concentrated in one tiny area. therefore, people will say \u201cokay, then have 3 players defending the signal and 1 turfing\u201d but realize that 1 player alone can\u2019t handle defending from both sides of the map at once.  \n\ni know tricolor battles are meant to put the winning team at a disadvantage but this is frankly overkill imo. team scissors at halftime was only winning by 1% (if that) so it didn\u2019t really feel like it was even necessary because all the teams were roughly tied. all it did was drag a roughly tied team down into the grave.  \n\ni know some individuals may have had fun, but the *consensus* is that team scissors players did not have fun in the tricolor battles, and there\u2019s a good reason why. what makes something addicting and rewarding is having a chance. that\u2019s why people gamble. i can\u2019t remember the name for it, but in psychology there is a term for the sweet spot where the chance ratio of something happening are super rewarding to the brain.  \nthere was no \u201cwe may win this time!\u201d to keep me going on team scissors. it just felt like \u201cwe\u2019re gonna lose again what\u2019s even the point\u201d, which isn\u2019t conducive to a happy playerbase nor addicting you to splatfests. and certainly not for 6 hours on one of the worst stages for a tricolor battle.  \n\n**edit:** keep in mind wrote this as a blurred general picture, not for the individual rare instances of the defending team pulling through because those are outliers tbh. the overwhelming majority of them are losses, and that\u2019s honestly not fair since it doesn\u2019t feel like your team can be redeemed if you\u2019re in first place at halftime. like you just know your team already lost because of how advantaged the offensive teams are in tricolor battles and that defeats the fun. hence, why people are calling them unbalanced."

I am a creative, logical problem solver but still unsure if this would be a good career match for me.\n\nCan anyone provide their insight to someone who doesn't know a lot about the field of environmental engineering? Would it be a major struggle to pass schooling for environmental engineering for someone who has difficulty with math? \n\nAny information or insight is appreciated. Thank you!"

Well, fear not, because I\u2019m very excited to be sharing this with you all. \n\nFor anyone who doesn\u2019t know, or has seen the video yet, INFJ Joyce Meng from the YT Channel \u201cTypeTalks\u201d INFJ Creator of the popular MBTI-Related Website \u201cPsychologyJunkie\u201d Susan Storm have both teamed up together to create an all-encompassing virtual mentorship program & community specifically designed and aligned for the INFJ Personality Type. \n\n- Joyce\u2019s YT Channel: \u201cTypeTalks\u201d: https://youtube.com/c/JoyceMeng22\n\n- Susan Storm from PsychologyJunkie: https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2015/07/23/about\n\n- PsychologyJunkie Website: https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/\n\n- Video of Joyce & Susan Talking about the Mentorship Program: https://youtu.be/hrf5YfNkfmw\n\n- Link to the Mentorship Program Website: https://psychology-junkie.lpages.co/infj-inspired/\n\nTaken straight from the Website\u2019s Main Page, we have their statement of purpose as to what they personally wanted to accomplish with this endeavor:\n\n\u201cINFJ Inspired Mentorship & Community Program\n\nBuilding a community of empowered INFJs\n\nINFJ Inspired is an intimate, year-long virtual mentorship program designed for changemaker INFJs who are fed up with feeling misunderstood and are ready to use their talents to embark on a more fulfilling life. It's for INFJs who refuse to settle for isolation, overwhelm, and the judgment that plagues many with this personality type. This program is about getting raw, authentic, and connected with other INFJs who are looking for connection, understanding, and personal growth.\u201d\n\nOur Village is for you if...\n* You feel the loss of community deep in your soul. You know you're not meant to be living in isolation or feeling like a fish out of water everywhere you go. But everyone is so distracted by devices, pressures, and \"fitting in\" that you've found yourself on the outskirts somewhere.\n\n* You see your role as an INFJ as a sacred, world-changing calling. You recognize the essential, visionary, humanity-healing value of your abilities but often wonder how to use your gifts or whether you're doing enough.\n\n* You want to understand yourself in a deeper way. You want to make the switch from being self-critical to self-compassionate. You want to understand how your mind works, and where your strengths and weaknesses lie so that you can live a fuller more self-aware life. And you want other INFJs to share with along the way!\n\n* You crave an unconventional level of success. You care about meaning more than material wealth, wellness of mind and body, the richness of your personal connections, and a purpose involving something bigger than what's happening on social media.\n\n* You want to live with consciousness and intention, yet often feel overwhelmed by demands, outside pressures, and the unrealistic standards this world seems to require of you.\n\n* You're committed to personal growth but realize that there's only so far you can go without the help and support of other like-minded friends and mentors on similar journeys.\n\n* You're tired of saying no to yourself, and have finally given yourself permission to examine and meet your needs, fulfill your dreams, and invest in the realization of your potential.\n\n* You need an outlet for your passion. Whether you want to finally write that novel you've been dreaming of, become an activist for a cause that matters to you, or start your own business, you need a safe and supportive community where you can show up and be heard, encouraged, and motivated.\n\n* You want life to slow down. You feel life passing you by more quickly every day, and you find yourself feeling disconnected from the natural world and the things that give you clarity, peace, and a sense of connection. You want to work with others (and a mentor) on rebuilding your connection to nature, stillness, and tranquility.\n\n* You want to understand your relationships more fully. You realize your family or relationship dynamics need some TLC but you want to figure out more about dealing with conflict, co-dependency, criticism, and communication (sometimes with people who are very different from you).\n\n\nWhat to Expect...\n\nOver the course of a year, beginning the first week in January 2022, you can expect to feel encouraged, supported, empowered, respected, seen, heard, and inspired. This will happen in the following ways...\n\n* INFJ Circles - Three Zoom calls per month (36 sessions per year!). Please plan to commit to at least two of three calls per month in order to support the purpose of the group, get the most out of this program, and find the friendships you crave.\n\n* Group Coaching - During our INFJ circles Susan Storm and Joyce Meng, both MBTI\u00ae certified practitioners and Enneagram coaches, will facilitate sessions that can gently guide you into a deeper understanding of yourself, your relationships, and the things that will revive and nourish your soul.\n\n* Optional access to a private INFJ Inspired Facebook group. This gives you the opportunity to further nourish your relationships with other INFJs and ask questions or get support from Susan and Joyce.\n\n* Printable guides, exercises, and tracking tools to keep you engaged, motivated, and increasingly self-aware. \n\n* Monthly printable planners with inspiring quotes specifically for INFJs for each day of the year.\n\n* Special rates on additional 1:1 coaching with Susan or Joyce to further support your process.\n\nEach month we will focus on a different theme designed to support you in not only thriving, but going after your dreams, and building friendships and connections with others. By the end of our year together, you'll wonder how you ever managed without the support and compassion of your new mentorship group.\nSome topics we'll explore include...\n\n* A deep-dive into your cognitive functions as an INFJ (understanding your mental hardware)\n\n* Guiding you through your Enneagram type (and the opportunity to take the RHETI\u00ae official Enneagram test, cost included in mentorship price).\n\n* Ego/Soul differentiation + Understanding your light and your shadow\n\n* Compassionate self-care and self-parenting\n\n* Claiming and nourishing our needs and desires\n\n* Exploring the good and bad stories that impact our lives\n\n* Creativity and career empowerment\n\n* Getting in touch with the natural world\n\n* Physical wellness and refreshment\n\n* Finding mental clarity in a world filled with distractions\n\n* Healing the wounds in our history\n\n* Exploring our relationships and how to improve them\n\n* Reflections on a year of growth and friendship-building\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSo please, for all you new members new to this community, to those who are seasoned veterans of this community, please take ample opportunity to seize this moment if you feel like this is for you. \n\nLet me know what you guys think!\n\nThanks! And best to you all. \u2764\ufe0f"

Radagon and Rennala's children hardly really react with one another, unless you count Ranni and her step brother and shadow Blaidd. However, Rykard and Ranni have some kind of relationship atleast before Rykard allowed himself to be devoured as we know that they plotted in the night of the black knives and it appears Rykard may have took the blame for it, earning him his title of Lord of Blasphemy. And since Radahn is a member of the golden order so he wouldn't of liked that very much, although Rykard still seems to care about his younger brother as he has his portrait hung in his manor.   \n\n\nHowever, Radahn and Ranni... It is very obvious that Ranni is the odd one out among the 3 children as she is way closer to her mother than Rykard or Radahn, but as we know Radahn and Ranni both became highly skilled sorcerers. And knowing this, Radahn put the stars arrest. But for what reason? The fate of astrologers is based upon the stars and reading the stars allows one to see their fate. So why would Radahn stop them? It's suggested to save Selia. And now that the stars have stopped, so has the fate of the astrologers and their destinies are halted. And it is once Radahn dies that fate is continued and Nokron is opened which is used to proceed Ranni's quest.  \n\n\nIs Ranni so callous and ambitious to not care that in order to meet her goal Radahn must die, or does she not like him for whatever reason? Coz damn. The dinner table conversations between Rykard, Ranni, Radahn and Blaidd must've been rough after she realised that he must die lol..."

But who is the fourth child? Blaidd. As we know, Blaidd is the shadow to Ranni and to quote Iji \"Blaidd is Lady Ranni's stepbrother, Ranni's mother, Queen Rennala, approved of him, and they played like siblings from childhood.\"  This goes to show that the fourth cradle possibly belongs to Blaidd as he was treated as a stepbrother and Queen Rennala knew and approved of him, so it wouldn't be a stretch to say he slept in the same chamber as his stepsiblings."

Thanks for reading, have a great day! :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5pk4dgpbabk71.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=842225ec338a5270406d448fcb3653642502852f"

About mom setting you up - i think you may give it a shot. Attraction is definitely built overtime and in relationships its much more important to find chemistry with the person (you can say \u201cclick\u201d). What i can suggest  is either finding people in your church (or a new church) its easier when you have someone who aligns with your values. You can also make a post at r/Christianr4r or r/Christiandating just be careful and look out for red flags, as always. I understand if you dont wanna go to dating apps but if you want to find a parter there are actions to take. Be active but not desperate, and im sure you will find someone you like.",

(So many characters have a death grip on me y'all it's not funny) but I'm curious about how cookies populate themselves.   \n\n\nThere's the first method, the witches made them and they ran away after gaining sentience. Ok, got that. Makes sense.   \n\n\nThen you had the Hollyberry story, where Holly had a son, who married and they had twins. Who we see as babies... who then grew up. So cookies can reproduce? (And age!) They have genetics, cause the twins take looks after their parents. Alright.  \n\n\nBut then, you have Strawberry Crepe, who said he was in a cryoincubator and woke up after the Vanilla kingdom was abandoned. So... is the incubator where the baby is developed? Do cookies get pregnant or do they just splice their DNA, pop it in a makeshift oven and bake the baby?   \n\n\nDo cookies need two parents then or is that a luxury? Almond cookie has a daughter (Walnut, in Ovenbreak) but there's no mention of a mom. Similarly, Holly had her son, but there's no mention of a father. Same with Dark Cacao. Alchemist and Vampire cookie are siblings cause they were baked in the same batch, and Princess and Tiger Lily are twins cause...they were baked in the same batch/their mom was pregnant? I'm so confused!   \n\n\nAre cookies with no parents straight from the godly oven? We see in the White Lily and Vanilla flashbacks that they were trying to play god, so it's implied that cookies can make other cookies, they just shouldn't. But do they now that the war is in a standstill? Is there an industry where cookies just combine ingredients and bam! You got a baby! Is that how the berry houses preserved themselves?  \n\nToo many cookies have mentioned their familial ties for me to look past this now, **where are the cookies coming from???**"

The sanctuary typically takes 6 days to reach Level 20, so with more alliances, we can hit it even sooner. And because we are so cosy, you can be assured that every vote counts, a lot. Members are more likely to get the dinos they voted for, and if they don't, we have Request spots specially for alliances to request a dino they want!\n\nIf you would like more information and/or to join us, just comment here or drop me a PM!"

Let me explain you why promiscuity doesn't work.\n\nWhen there's love involved (real love, that love does not allow multiple partners), there's higher values involved. There's companionship and faith in the other person - the knowledge that you can depend on them when all hell breaks loose.\n\nWhen love is cheapened, when one of it's highest expressions (sex) can be engaged in freely and without shame - each of the partners becomes replaceable. A hunt for the better catch ensues. Neither of the partners will trust one another or put any hope in them staying around through thick and thin. If they want to keep them they need to live in stress of constantly being reevaluated. A spouse is no longer your friend, your helper, your support - they becomes your assessor, ready to leave you if you ever so slightly fall short of her standards or if she catches the interest of someone who can do the things you can't. People stop treating one another as human beings - they start seeing themselves as tools for gratification. Eventually a generation of narcissists and psychopaths emerges and we're at that threshold, unless we're already well past it (I might've spend too much time in my ivory tower). And then - civilization dies. It dies slowly but surely because it's foundational cell, a family, no longer serves it's purposes, far from it, it cannot even last long enough to rear a new generation.\"\n\nWe're killing civilisation, guys.

I had a very bad bout of PMDD in January, as well as a period that went on for weeks, and went to a gynaecologist, who got me on Yaz. Yaz was good in regulating menstrual cramps, but didn't help my PMDD at all. The symptoms seemed to have decreased in severity, but somehow became spread over the whole month. I would have depressive symptoms on days or weeks when i wasn't supposed to have PMS. And this month it was just as bad as before again, so the gynaecologist switched to Yasmin - i only started on it a few days ago - and also prescribed Prozac for me to take a fortnight before my period.\n\nI haven't tried Prozac yet since it isn't time, but i realise that even yesterday, when my period should have already ended, the PMDD still hadn't gone away. Even today, i'm still feeling the brain fog, general depressive feeling and lack of interest in anything, and i'm worried because it's supposed to be over. I'm not sure if what i have is actually dysthymia, or Yasmin is making my symptoms worse and prolonged.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this?

One of the many ridiculous upsetting thoughts i get is jealousy that randomly arises when my boyfriend is with one of my metamours - usually when i'm feeling kinda bored and lonely at the same time. I get upset imagining that he's away having fun with them while i'm sitting here with mood swings and some stomach discomfort from PMS. I get sulky that i don't get any attention. Sometimes i reach a point where i even start rethinking whether i'm cut out for polyamory, which i know is *definitely* absurd because at every other time i'm perfectly fine with it. Besides, i'm not even mono myself so i'm being hypocritical, i know that. \n\nEven when not having PMS, i generally don't feel compersion, but i definitely do get by on a more neutral mood, and am supportive and happy enough that my boyfriend loves and cares for his partners. I've managed to hold back on any kind of outbursts towards him even when i'm irrationally moody, and just calmly explain that PMS makes me insecure and would he give me a bit more reassurance when we're together again? And he has learnt that reassurance is really all that i need. And often, after some sleep, i wake up feeling fine again.\n\nHowever, it's really just those few hours when he's away with his other partner and unable to message me, and before i fall asleep, that are somehow extremely agonising. Is anyone here a victim of PMS, or anything similar as well? Just hoping for people to commiserate with, and share coping strategies if any.

So i wanted to share that this sub has helped me for the better, and also helped me to articulate feelings and insecurities i never knew i had, and to not feel guilty about establishing my boundaries and needs. Polyamory can be a lot of work and effort maintaining 2 relationships, and boy did i encounter a whole lot of issues i never expected to have, but i'm really happy to have been given the chance to work on them, and i see a pretty good long-term future for myself now. \n\nI don't think i'm able to articulate my comments and advice in the same way many members here do, and i don't have as much experience as you guys do and have my own issues to work on still, so i probably wouldn't comment a lot, but please know that you have a silent fan here.

Being a parent sounds like torture. I get that people feel a sense of accomplishment from raising another person, but that person is going to essentially ruin your life. You become a shell of your former self for 6-7 years while they're completely dependant on you, them when they become slightly more independent you still have to help them with homework and spend your days carting them to and from school and activities. The first time you'll get some respite is when they're teenagers who want nothing to do with you and probably hate your guts. Then they grow up and have kids and you become a babysitter. I know it's not all bad and there must be a lot of joyful moments sprinkled throughout, but there's nothing in this world that could make me want to give up my life for it. I'm so thankful that my sister is desperate to have kids so I can be a fun aunt and experience those rewarding moments then send them back home when things get difficult.",

It's a raglan, so you're gonna have to crochet this top-down and switch to a bauble stitch for the sleeves (which will require some math to make sure you get the right amount of baubles per row). Even if you wanted to do a faux raglan and just sew the sleeves on you'd have to be comfortable doing increases/decreases, and although it's not super hard to do it just adds another layer of difficulty. The bauble stitch also requires good tension, which can be really difficult even for intermediate crocheters. \n\n\nI think if you tweak this it's definitely doable. My suggestion would be to ditch the raglan design and just do a 4-panel sewn sweater. Basically all you'll need are two big double crochet rectangles for the body with a bit of a scoop for the neckline and two long rectangles with the bauble stitch that you'll sew into tubes for the arms. The sleeve are probably what's gonna give you the most trouble, so start out with the body first. If the baubles aren't turning out the way you want you can always do an easier fun stitch (shell stitch, alpine stitch, etc) to get a similar effect",

I did 2 consultations with him in the past 2 years (first time I ended up not being able to afford the surgery), and now all that's left to do is finalize everything. My eye bags are something that's bothered me my entire life and I know it's only gonna look worse as I age so I wanna get it done now that I have a bit of extra money. At the same time I'm terrified that something might happen. I have really bad health anxiety and all I can think about is what if something goes wrong? I'll be going abroad to the US to get it done and I'm scared of that already, plus all the complications that could pop up. I asked the surgeon if there are any complications that could happen and he said none, which I know a lot of people consider a big red flag but again he has so many good reviews and before/afters plus he's written journal articles on the procedure I'm getting so I didn't really think it was a big deal. \n\n\nWhat are your guys' thoughts? I really want to get it done and literally every other surgeon I've talked to has recommended things that are proven not to work for genetic festoons (fillers, lower bleph) or has suggested something completely out of left field (under-eye lipo, a \"mystery cocktail\" of stuff injected into them, etc) so this guy is the only one who seems to know what he's talking about"

Tenya Iida's character is a teachers pet JOCK! he is ATHLETIC and CHRISTAN. A man like Tenya Iida COULD NOT BE A GAMER because he would be way too focused on studies, working out and prayer to the Lord and savior Jesus!! And even if he DID find the free time to play a game, his aforementioned love of Christ would push him away from toxic online games like fortnight!! Now you could argue that Tenya Iida would play phone \"games\" but those are hardly games, they aren't challenging and don't involve any skill which is what qualifies a REAL GAMER. Minecraft is not a real game btw so \ud83d\ude44 or Roblox! Tenya Iida is just not cut out for REAL GAMES like COD or GTA, Detroit Become Human- He couldn't play those games!! Honestly the more I think about it the ANGRIER I get just delete the whole post, Tenya would never do this, he would never listen to Victory Royale OR the original song!! Tenya. Is. NOt. AN. \"EPIC\".FORTNIGHT. GAMER!! Please stop, your making us real Tenya Iida fans look like fools in the eyes of K\u014dhei Horikoshi and Studio Bones with this concannon content!!"

So occasionally we sit down and do some of the lessons. He still only knows m, s, a, \u0113, t, d\u2026. I think that\u2019s it. We repeat them quite a bit. But he\u2019s so excited and he cries every time we stop. \n\nIf you have a toddler excited about reading\u2026 yeah it\u2019s a great book. Do better than me, and offer it daily, instead of sighing to yourself whenever he hefts the book over to you. I really gotta work on that. -_-",

I am looking for something scenic, warm, cheap & suitable for intermediate cyclists. As I'll be on the road with friends prior to doing the trip I won't be bringing a bike with me so have been toying with the option of buying a second hand bike in Passau (or renting) and going to Vienna. \n\nI chose this initially because I'd be doing it alone as a woman (safe, well travelled route) and a first timer (easy). One thing I'm wondering about is availability of accommodation on this route, campsites seem to be there but relatively sparse, guesthouses and hostels seem fully booked by now and I don't want to pay for a tour - would there be accom available in stops along the way? If so how expensive would it be. I'm not opposed to camping but I won't have the equipment with me from travelling beforehand either so would have to buy before setting off.  \n\nCan anyone recommend other routes on the Eurovelo preferably where one could simply roll into towns along the way and find cheap hostels or guesthouses? Preferably ending in a big city so that I can sell and fly out again. Sorry for the rambling!:)"

I was on a quest from 13-20: find the socks that really say who you are to the world. Who I was was always changing, it was a confusing time - and filled with socks!\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago I went to Primark after work because I needed socks. I *needed* socks. I needed, specifically, ankle socks for running. Primark had about 7 different styles of running socks all in various colours. Arch support, microfibre, extra padding, neon colours, black, white, extra short cut! \n\nI think I spent about 25 minutes at the sock section, picking up and discarding socks because they were 'too jazzy' or wouldn't support my arches. I was actually *frustrated* at the amount of choice for the first time ever! I eventually settled on plain arch support running socks with breathable technology and one subtle colour stripe per pair. I didn't even look over at the fun socks or long socks. They're not practical enough for me anymore :( \n\nAnyone have any bitter moments like this where you realise time is marching on and you're now not who you used to be?!"

(I feel kinda stupid asking this after having grinded so much & precisely choreographed whole sections of every floor... ^(\"))\n\nTeam 1:   \n**Razor** (DPS)   \n**Qiqi** (Healer, Freeze + Superconduct for Razor)   \n**Mona** (Support, Freeze + Electro-Charge)   \n**Fischl/Baal** (Electro Resonance + Energy Recharge;\n\nI've read that Baal is the same as Fischl but better on multiple targets & since I have her C2 which sounds insane on paper, I kinda switched Fischl for Baal.\n\nI used to have Bennett in this team but decided to put him with Hu Tao's team for the pyro resonance & do Bennett ult, then Mona ult (vaporize + buff from Bennett), then Fischl ult (electro charge + buff from Bennett & Mona).   \nI've also had Jean instead of Qiqi/Bennett for a while but I kinda think Anemo is lame as an element..   \nPlus, since Razor is all abt physical damage I think having Qiqi's Frost Herald on him during his ult is super nice for the extra Superconduct. Sometimes I freeze stuff with Qiqi & Mona,  which is nice, but I don't rly focus on that...\n\nTeam 2:   \n**Hu Tao** (DPS)   \n**Bennett** (Healer, Pyro Resonance)   \n**Ningguang** (Sub DPS)   \n**Zhongli** (Shield, Geo Resonance)\n\nThe idea here is to capitalize on Pyro & Geo resonance (+25% ATK & +15% **DMG** & shield strength!) & after Hu Tao's skill times out (& increases the rest of the team's Crit Rate) I always do the following:\n\n1. Bennett's ult\n2. Ningguang's screen\n3. Zhongli's shield (after walking through the screen)\n4. Zhongli's ult\n5. Ningguang ult (after walking through the screen)\n6. Ningguang charged attack (C6)\n7. another Ningguang screen\n8. back to Hu Tao Super high elemental dmg, should be especially strong against the Ruin machine type enemies on 12-3... idk\n\nIf I tryhard like a madman, I can get 34 but some claim to be completely F2P & clear it with ease, so what's my blatant mistake?",

Additionally to their normal effect, that is. (The normal effect is just 1.5x dmg for Pyro on Hydro (Vaporize) or Cryo on Pyro & 2x dmg for Hydro on Pyro (Vaporize) & Pyro on Cryo (Melt), like, ice trumps fire, water trumps fire, but fire can still evaporate water & ice can still extinguish fire :P)\n\nMaybe **instead of Yoimiya** u could go for **Bennett** or **Thoma** as support but Bennett's ult on Hu Tao is a bit awkward since it heals u over 50%, idk abt Thoma but if u have someone C6 u should capitalize on that imo.  \nA fire Sub DPS/Support is essential in my opinion cuz the resonance (25% extra ATK) just for having 2 fire chars is very good.\n\n**Sucrose** for the **4 piece Viridescent Venerer** pyro debuff, should be insane on Hu Tao, especially if u pull everyone with her ult & then u can spam charge attack on Hu Tao & hit them all (ofc u can't pull Ruin Guards etc, but for the other floors).  \n**Instead of Sucrose** u could use **Jean** if Hu Tao's heal isn't enough for u but the Anemo/Swirl frequency will be much lower & idk if 4 piece VV on Jean is worth it (I have 2 glad, 2 maiden on her, cuz I have her in a team w/ Xiao)  \n\n\nSecond team could be **Eula, Diona, Fischl, Xiangling.**\n\n**Eula** is a very good DPS according to the internet, **Diona** just cuz u have her C6 & u need *some* healer.   \n**Rosaria** is a good Sub DPS/Cryo Character in general (just a bit weird to build) but I don't think u can make it w/o a healer... \\^\\^\"\n\n**Xiangling** is strong in general & she's very good at applying pyro, which, again, will give u good Pyro reactions (plus, iirc, her passive gives u that 10% extra ATK chili :P) \n\nIdk if u could use **Beidou** ***instead*** **of Fischl** cuz I love Fischl & don't think anyone (except Baal maybe) can replace her as a energy recharge battery & the fact that u just place Oz & switch out makes her a very nice additional dmg source. Beidou on the other hand is just strong & with Beidou's ult Eula can increase her physical dmg through Superconduct. Eula should be focussing on physical dmg anyway, so it's a nice synergy, I think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(All that on the assumption, that u don't wanna spend much time on leveling ur chars that r still on low levels.)",

He is supposed to be a stay at home dad and he stays up to ungodly hours and is not awake for the children until halfway through the day at times. He's stumbling and falling around the house, blaring music, and desperately keeping ME awake to the early hours even though I have to go to work in the morning.\n\nHe IS much more friendly and receptive of the children after he's started drinking, and he is VERY affectionate towards me, even though his touch is starting to feel like razor blades due to our disconnect. That is until I suggest him not buying more alcohol (he doesn't work and were struggling financially) and he LOSES HIS MIND. Screaming at me about how I do nothing for him emotionally or around the house. \n\nHe insists that he's going to do what he's going to do. But I really try to get to bed as fast as I can to prevent having to interact with him. It makes me feel terrible as a wife, but it's pushing me so far away. I don't know how to deal with this. Do I say anything? How do I bring it? What things do i avoid saying to prevent a potential blowup?"

It was small progress but it was something. \n     Then she was back, but she wasn't talking about it at all, wearing a loose cardigan to conceal the newly gained weight. I knew it was weird, but if she made it this far! So I followed her everywhere including here and hoped that positivity was all she needed. \n     Recently however, I've been noticing many posts on here that go beyond frustration.\n They are of genuine disappointment with her recent behavior. Of course I'm not talking about the people who pointlessly try to argue with her about her condition online, but actual concerns that have been shot down on her streams, and it's beginning to become hopeless. \nIt's almost beginning to seem like she only gained the weight to get people off of her back. \nA lot of you have pointed out that other people suffering from ED may look to her for 'thinspo'\n I can't speak for this. I really don't want to believe that is happening. It seems unbelievable anybody would want to be that thin. I recovered from eating disorder in highschool, and then I thought she looked crazy, but sometimes I do like the way her clothing fits her. I think her waist looks elegant sometimes. That's crazy right?! \nTo sum it up, I've been seeing some despariging things about her, and I can't prove them wrong. Hope she recovers, but I can't follow her anymore. The only way to reach out to her is follow her downward, and that's the only thing I won't do."

You have 4 stats from what i remember, attack power, money, manpower and something else. You can choose one of these stats to boost every turn and/or declare war. The map is set on an X-Y axis, with Y being time of the Empire and X being territory controlled by the Empire. There are a plethora of empires from Rome to Yamato, and all the civilizations have their own well drawn avatar. When you fight another country/empire, it becomes a Pokemon style game with health and AP and such. When you defeat someone, you can take land. There is also a mechanic where you can go searching for rulers and you use your rulers as weapons to increase health and attack power?"

                "body": "Context :\nI have a long time friend that I really like for everything she made for me since our 6 years relationship. Like she helped me in the hardest mental moments, she offered me to move to her mother's house with her when my parents kicked me out, in brief she's a real friend and I care very much about her.\n\nTwo years ago (I was living with her and her mother), I told her that I needed to move to a big city for my studies, that I planned everything financially and where to move and stuff like that if she wanted to follow me, and she did.\n\nI found a good apartment next to the metro, the grocery store, the city hall, parks for her dog etc etc.. I negociated with the agency to put her name in the lease even if they didn't wanted to at all at first, I also negociated the rent and water/energy bill to be fixed at a good price for both of us, so inflation and energy crisis would not be a problem. She's trading on stocks market and she's doing great, so even if she's not rich, she has a good quality of life compared to other people living next to us.\n\nFor the money talks, I pay for everything and at the end of the month we split the bit in half (even if she consumes products way more expansive but ok). So internet, rent and charges, groceries... Everything is split in two.\n\nNow she often need to move back to her hometown for around two weeks sometimes to do stuff, then she comes back in our apartment. Totally fine for me, she does her things I do mine.\n\nIn the end of last year, she stayed 3 months in her hometown. As I said it's fine for me, even if I felt a little bit alone without her (I live with her for 3 years now).\n\nToday, when we did the accounts of what we owed to each other and I asked her to pay for the energy bills, she told me that she don't have to pay because she wasn't there for 3 months. So I started to explain totally obvious things like \"if we travel in another city or country for 2 mounth, we still have to pay the rent and bills\" and other things like that and now she's telling me that I want to scam her.\n\nThat's really not what I want. I like living with her because of the good dynamic we have that keeps me away from my problems when I need to, and a lot of other reasons but it would be too long to make an enumeration. I plan to stay in this city for at least 3 years and I prefer living with her than another person (normal she's one of my closest friends).\n\nNow I don't know how to make her understand that what I'm doing is fair. Or maybe it isn't ?? I need you to tell me that's why I'm here.\n\nIf you need details or have some questions, feel free to ask !\n\n\nTLDR : My friend who lives with me stayed at her mom's for 3 months refused to pay for the electricity bill (that has its price fixed every mounth) when she was out our apartment. AITA for telling her to pay even if she wasn't there ?"

Kieran and Lauren went to Greychapel 2 days later on the 28th. They went again the next night on the 29th. 2 or 3 days later they went to the circus, so it would have been the 31st or the new year already. all That shit with Sake and Sandman happened, one week later Lauren went Kieran\u2019s apartment were he told her about the witness for Chows case. Several days passed before the new year. I\u2019m working on a post for this rn, i\u2019ll have a bunch of screenshot evidence in it.",

He\u2019s funny, charming and sexy. B. He has a traumatic past. Everyone loves a trauma victim. And C. He\u2019s the deuteragonist and Lauren\u2019s love interest. the simple truth is that people empathize more with characters they know, and it certainly helps that the authors are writing him as a protagonist. What if another person in Kierans position who we didn\u2019t know killed him, hm? We, as fans of Kieran, would hate that person. The reason we\u2019re able to forgive Kierans actions so easily is because we don\u2019t know and love any of his victims.\n\nYes, Kieran was forced to become an assassin and it wasn\u2019t his choice, but he still killed god knows how many innocent people. \u201che has more kills than anyone else in the PS combined\u201c apparently, and if that\u2019s true, he basically ***is*** the PS. What\u2019s even the point of making him an enemy of the Phantom Scythe if the majority of their kills are by his hand? He once killed so many people at a time that the streets literally ran red with blood, remember?\n\nThis also might seem somewhat more forgivable if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he\u2019s justifying his actions with the exact same excuse that the P.S. uses for theirs- sacrifice a few for the good of the many. And let\u2019s not forget who the greatest enemy is; the aristocracy. The reason the P.S. formed in the first place was to take them down, and as they put it, \u201cbecoming monsters to fight the bigger monsters, for our monarchs have been killing more people than we ever could.\u201d Kieran\u2018s not just killing innocent people to destroy a group that\u2019s causing more deaths than him; he\u2019s killing innocent people to stop a group that\u2019s trying to stop the people who are causing the most deaths. Even if he succeeded in destroying the P.S., there\u2019s still the monarchy. And while there are people like Dakan trying to bring change, there are more people who want things to stay the same. If Dakan\u2019s efforts were successful, the P.S. wouldn\u2019t exist in the first place. Besides, its essentially confirmed that his main motive isn\u2019t making the world a better place- it\u2019s revenge. As horrible as the P.S. is, in a way this actually makes them seem better than Kieran.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, we can also look at it from a more logical perspective. If someone killed a bunch of people and then went on a path of righteousness, do their past actions matter anymore? Nothing that they did can be undone, but they can change the future, and maybe for the better if given the chance. And even if not, they might at least be able to find their own happiness. If they don\u2019t hurt anyone in doing so, wouldn\u2019t that be a good thing? if they\u2019re not hurting anyone any more, would having them face justice for their crimes really be justice, or just revenge? Hurting them won\u2019t undo the harm they\u2019ve done, it will just cause more harm. The thing is that because of our memories, a lot of people have trouble letting go of the past. It can also seem like a betrayal to the persons victims, which is where the more spiritual part comes in.\n\nI\u2019m an atheist, and therefor believe that it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens after a person dies, since theyre, well, dead. They\u2019ll never know and it could never affect them in any way. However, despite trying to view these situations with this logic, I\u2019ve always had an extremely hard time letting go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love Kieran too and I want so badly to be able to forgive him but this has just been causing me a major ethical dilemma as well as a lot of anxiety and I wanna know what you guys think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsorry if this is confusing! Im really bad with words and have always struggled to get my thoughts across to other people. It\u2019s also probably very messy and repetitive, I do that a lot, sorry! Also, sorry for the kind of snarky beginning, my antisocial neurodiverse brain has a hard time reading others, I dont give you guys enough credit\ud83d\ude05"

On top of that, it\u2019s a reminder of how completely alone he is in the world. He accepted a long time ago that no one could ever care about the PH, and the fact that his birthday happens to be on Valentine\u2019s Day always felt like some sort of sick joke to him. He walks into the office expecting it to be a crappy day, only to be startled half to death by his friends wishing him a happy birthday, with a cake baked (probably by Lila) just for him. He does a double take of his surroundings, and once he finally processes the situation, swallows back the lump in his throat and smiles wider than he can ever remember having done on his birthday. He looks around at his friends and thinks to himself; \u2018maybe things could be different now.\u2019"

And THREE BLOOD MOONS?? One of which was on the SAME NIGHT as one of the fucking Destroyer fights???\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've had barely any chances at all to progress because every time I use one of my spelunker potions to go looking for ores it hits 8:30 PM and I get the god damn \"You feel vibrations from deep below...\" message. Every fucking time.\n\nNot to mention, as soon as I entered hardmode, the game decided it would be a \\*fantastic\\* idea to spawn the new corruption RIGHT NEXT TO MY JUNGLE. It's already spread so deep underground that my chances to salvage it are practically next to nothing.\n\nI'm tempted to start a new world with this character and blaze through all the pre-hardmode stuff. I don't think this jungle is salvageable at all which will be a massive issue when the time comes to fight Plantera (if I even get to at all because this game loves spawning that god damn robot worm every other night just to fuck with me).\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with this game now."

My opinion was that living your life while solely taking into account finances is a depressing way to live.

I ate my second full course meal of the day. And still didint feel full. I went to physical therapy. Got more food from chick fil a.Ate it and still don\u2019t feel full. and then took a bath and went to bed at the 24. That was at 7 pm. It is now 5 am and i still feel high. When will it end? Everything feels numb like i feel slightly itchy but when i go to scratch it\u2019s like nothing there idk how to explain it. My sense of taste feels dull also. But fr when is it gonna be over?"

He has never bitten a dog before but in the recent months he\u2019s become aggressive in the fact that he will chase, pin, and snarl in a dogs face for no apparent reason. It\u2019s never any of the dogs we know and he actually plays the best with one of the regular small dogs. \n\nI\u2019ve identified two situations in which he becomes aggressive. The first is when a small dog starts running really fast he\u2019ll start barking at it and chase it till he catches it and then pins it on its back and snarls. \n\nThe second situation is when another dog tries to sniff him and he\u2019ll just snap and pin and snarl. \n\ni\u2019ve become very perceptive to his body language and can tell when he\u2019s about to snap so now i can stop him before it happens. But idk why it happens. We got him neutered 3 weeks ago and he\u2019s calmed down a little  but it still happens. My biggest fear is that he won\u2019t be able to play at the park anymore .\n\n[dog](https://imgur.com/a/UXhxQiP)"

Even with the discount, the amount of debt is beyond what I can afford to pay. \n\nShould I try to negotiate the offer for a steeper discount? Since them caving 50% is already quite considerable and probably indicates that they just want it paid and over with.\n\nOr, should I just ignore it and let them keep chasing me for it?

As an idea, it sounds great. In reality, not so much. \n\nEspecially when most of everything else is going, how you want it to go or even better than you expected from life. You question are you being petty, are you being selfish, is there just something wrong with you? How much am I willing to make my life and the lives of others uncomfortable over this issue? Financially, is this even a viable path? Is the trade-off worth it? For every story you hear about those who pulled the trigger and don't regret it, there is another one that wished they had done something different, tried harder, stuck it out a bit longer or just plain regret the fallout. \n\nThat's the final point. Seeing the fallout of other relationships that have gone that way. The divorce, the custody of the kids, the splitting of assets, the alimony, the child support, the loss of friends and family, the change of living situation. The list goes on and on but if you think about it, it never really so easy or simple to just do it and in some cases it's not the best thing to do, despite the sentiment you will see expressed by many.",

For me personally, even after resolving most of our issues and having regular sex now I still feel anxiety about initiating and often won't because of it. I know it's 95% me at this point, but after it being such a source of pain for a time, it may be a while before I get over my aversion to initiating. \n\nEven in a place like this at times, HLs are shamed for trying to initiate with their partner, expressing the importance of sex in their lives, expressing how the lack of sex makes them feel, their feelings are minimized and invalidated, treated as deviants and even at times it's implied they are the equivalent of sex offenders. The blame is often put on them despite the context given, suggesting otherwise. \n\nThe lack of sex is so much easier and faster to fix than healing sex aversion and rejection trauma. Wanting to be desired is pretty universal, and for most, it's the root of the issue. There is nothing better than being able to express your desire to your partner and it being reciprocated enthusiastically. At some point, it may be a good idea to talk about it and try to restore that trust, help them feel it's safe to initiate,  and start building a positive atmosphere around the idea of initiating. It's as much if a roadblock to recovery as anything else. Takes a lot of patience. Good luck.",

Even on non advice posts. \n\nI wouldn't say LLs are taking over. I do think many HLs just found this isn't as safe of a place to vent or even seek advice as it once was from their perspective. It's gets old really fast to have your feelings dismissed or be told that expressing those feelings makes you a sexual assailant. The vocal minority just ebbs and flows here.

How will I be graded? What subjects can I study? Yk, the basic stuff lol.\n\nSecond, would taking it be right for my situation?  \nQuick rundown of what exactly \"my situation\" is:  I rlly want to study abroad (from the Philippines btw), so I've been looking at the country specific admission requirements for some unis that I'm interested in. Problem is, a lot of these unis don't accept a Filipino HS diploma on its own and often require students to complete an \"alternative qualification\" or take a foundation year (and yes we don't have AP programs here ://). I don't rlly want to take a foundation year, and Ig the IB counts as an \"alternative qualification\" so here I am. I've also looked into the AP Capstone Program, but afaik there's only 1 school in the Philippines that offers it and I'd rather not move all the way to another province for it (there's one school that offers IB where I live so no need to move :DD). I also applied for a scholarship that will allow me to study in Singapore (who's HS diploma is accepted for direct entry), but there's a good chance I won't be shortlisted for it :// I'm also a bit hesitant to have to leave the school that I've studied in for abt a decade now, but if doing so gets me closer to going abroad, then so be it. \n\nIg that's all I have for now :> If there are some things that I haven't rlly made clear pls feel free to ask :)) Rlly looking forward to ur responses r/IBO :DD thanks in advance \uff08\\*\uff3e-\uff3e\\*\uff09"

I'm open to all genres and styles so that I can see what I like (and what I don't like) and I'll be able to narrow down what exactly my taste in books is.\n\nIdk if this is even relevant to what I'm asking for, but here are the few books that I've already read:\n\n\\- The Little Prince (Antoine De Saint Exupery)\n\n\\- The Alchemist (Paulo Coelho)\n\n\\- The Catcher in the Rye (J.D Salinger)\n\n\\- No Longer Human (Dazai Osamu)\n\n\\- Sherlock Holmes (all 4 novels and 56 short stories, Arthur Conan Doyle)\n\n\\- The Iliad and Odyssey (Homer)\n\nI'll try to check out everyone's replies when I wake up :> Thanks in advance \uff08\\*\uff3e-\uff3e\\*\uff09"

By that time I was so late that I couldn't shower or eat and still showed up late for work. \n\nI had a chill weekend and went to bed on time last night. It's so frustrating because I really try so hard to stick to my routines just so I can get up in the morning and I don't even know where this is coming from. My whole body hurts and I feel like a zombie. I'm not even depressed imo. Is this a common thing? Any ideas how to deal with it?"

Throughout our kindergarten and elementary school years, he used to have a crush on me and we were just really good friends. I don't think I ever returned his feelings, I mean it was just a little childhood crush. It was a genuinely good friendship, like I get nostalgic when I think about it. Our dads were also childhood friends and our houses are literally 2 minutes away from one another.\n\nThere was a period of time, we were about 12-13, when he began to distance himself from me. I have no idea what the reason was, I just know that he stopped talking to me and I did nothing about it. I used to invite him to my birthday parties and he used to come even though we weren't talking, but then I stopped inviting him for a reason I don't remember.\n\nWe both used to like basketball and we played for our school's team. Occasionally, he would explain to me how to do certain moves in basketball, since he was much better at it. \n Then we played against each other and pretty much the only interactions these past few years were formal and through basketball.\n\nI regret not doing anything about our friendship, I just let it disappear. I even have dreams about him sometimes, he just seems to look at me and walk by me without saying a word. What's bugging me the most is the fact that I don't know the reason why he just left me. I don't recall any problems, we never had any fights and idk. I don't think I miss him, but i don't even know how I feel about him tbh. \n\nAny advice ? I don't know what I should do. It's as if I want to become friends with him again but I don't want to reach out first. Are we ever going to return to each other's lives ? I wonder if he ever thinks about me like I think about him."

Do I sense a fallacy?\n\n**Composition Fallacy**:\n\n>The fallacy of composition is an informal fallacy that arises when one infers that something is true of the whole from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole. A trivial example might be: \"This tire is made of rubber, therefore the vehicle of which it is a part is also made of rubber.\"\n\nYou knew Gamers must be pretty tame. Especially since anti-g@mers like Vlad the Impaler would find that childs play.\n\nIf your squeamish to the atrocities of anti-g@mers I suggest you stop reading. \n\n>No one was immune to Vlad's attentions. His victims included women and children, peasants and great lords, ambassadors from foreign powers and merchant\n\n>He was a fan of various forms of torture including disemboweling and rectal and facial impalement. Vlad the Impaler tortured thousands while he ate and drunk among the corpses. He impaled every person in the city of Amlas -- 20,000 men, women and children. Vlad often ordered people to be skinned, boiled, decapitated, blinded, strangled, hanged, burned, roasted, hacked, nailed, buried alive, stabbed, etc. He also liked to cut off noses, ears, sexual organs and limbs. But his favorite method was impalement on stakes, hence the surname \"Tepes\" which means \"The Impaler\" in the Romanian language. \n\n>Maidens who lost their virginity, adulterous wives and unchaste widows were all targets of Vlad's cruelty. Such women often had their sexual organs cut out or their breasts cut off. They were also often impaled through the vagina on red-hot stakes that were forced through the body until they emerged from the mouth. One report tells of the execution of an unfaithful wife. Vlad had the woman's breasts cut off, then she was skinned and impaled in a square in Tirgoviste with her skin lying on a nearby table. \n\n>He also looked upon the poor, vagrants and beggars as thieves. Consequently, he invited all the poor and sick of Wallachia to his princely court in Tirgoviste for a great feast. After the guests ate and drank, Dracula ordered the hall boarded up and set on fire. No one survived.\n\nYeah Anti-g@mers are wicked devils.....",

Please give us one, that makes warmind cells created by us inmune to any other guardian.\n\nAlternatively, make all warmind cells inmune to players who don't have any warmind cell mods equipped.

                "body": "I know Bungie cut the idea of pinnacle weapons in flavor of ritual weapons. These are just ideas I had. Just to clarify. \n\nVanguard:\n\n \"Epilogue\" Suros rocket launcher. (Void)\n\n Intrinsic: \"Suros Cluster Frame\". Upon detonation, rockets create cluster explosions. It's perks should focus on velocity and reload. \n\nMain perk: \"Ongoing\". Reload after a multikill to increase the number of clusters and cluster bomb damage. Max 5. Lasts until next rocket is fired.\n\nAll vanguard pinnacle weapons shared the same idea: kill as many red-bar enemies as possible, as fast as possible. Vanguard weapons are for crowd control (except maybe Wendigo, but even that with blinding grenades). This weapon would do just that. Plus it's a heavy, where ammo is not as plentiful.\n\nRequirements (in any strike): rocket launcher kills (1000-1500?), Hero or higher Nightfall: The Ordeal completions (30).\n\nGambit:\n\n\"Hand it over\" suros slug shotgun. (Kinetic, projectile). It has a scope, or some kind of sights that zoom. \n\nIntrinsic: \"Suros Explosive Slugs\". Fires explosive slugs that stick to enemies. Hold (reload) to detonate all fired slugs. It's perks should focus on range and stability; and Grave Robber. \n\nMain perk: \"Rangeseeker\". Aiming down sights with this weapon increases it's effective range and projectile speed. Slugs do increased explosive damage based on the distance they travelled, when detonated. \n\nGambit pinnacle weapons have to do a little bit of everything: boss damage, crowd control and reliability vs. Guardians. I feel that these weapons *were* the most balanced out of all pinnacle weapons (Breakneck is in ruins...). This weapon delivers more damage that a normal slug shotgun, and it can do that damage at a range (via it's perk, it does even more at range!). The slug itself does less damage that a normal slug, but more when you add the explosion. In pvp, you'd still need to get a headshot, which at close range just outright kills the enemy. At longer ranges, precision hits are much harder to hit (because this is a projectile weapon), but if you land one and detonate, it kills a guardian. Bodyshots + detonation does not kill in pvp (it leaves them with enough health that anything kills them in 1 shot), unless you have some damage buff.\n\nRequirements (in gambit or prime): 300 shotgun kills, reach Gambit rank Fabled, 50 shotgun guardian kills, 150 blockers defeated. \n\nCrucible:\n\n(I couldn't come up with a name) Suros auto rifle (energy, solar).\n\nIntrinsic: \"Suros Adaptive Frame.\" Reliable, firm grip. Firing increases stability and range over time. Perks should give this weapon handling; also High Impact Reserves.\n\nMain perk: \"Tricky Elements\". This weapon's elemetal damage always matches the elemental shield of and enemy, and the element of an enemy guardian in its super. Breaking a shield with this weapon temporally increases this weapon's rate of fire, stability, handling and range. \n\nCrucible weapons are the hardest to balance. Weapons that gain damage are just gonna be generally better in any activity that others (*the victims of The Recluse screaming in the distance...*). This weapon is a duel weapon, but is does not gurantee a win; you still have to land your shots and break your opponent's shield. The idea behind this, is that if you are using this weapon, and manage to break your opponents' shield, the higher RoF (and unchanged damage, much like Redrix's weapons) lets you get ahead of your opponent. The perk should only last for a few seconds, but can be refreshed after another shield break. It turns the weapon from a 600 rpm to a 900 rpm without damage loss, also giving it a huge stability, handling and range bonus. High Impact Reserves just increases your damage naturally, since you'll be using some ammo to break the shield.\n\nThe matching elements part of the perk means, that although it deals solar damage, it works every time in \"match game\" modified activities and gets the damage bonus vs. enemy supers. But it only gains bonus damage when solar burn is active.\n\nRequirements (in the crucible): 500 energy weapon kills, 50 auto rifle medals (I don't know the name of it...), earn 2500 Glory in total, reach Valor rank Mythic. \n\nBonus score on the energy weapon kills and medals in Iron Banner and in the Survival playlist. (2x-3x)\n\nAnd, if by any chance there will be pinnacle weapons in the future, please be bounties or pursuits, NOT Triumphs. Or make triumphs trackable when getting your ghost out."

Can you use Absorb Elements to protect yourself from damage caused by a creature with Limited Magic Immunity? Can they pass through a Wall of Force? Do they ignore Leomund's Tiny Hut when targeting a creature inside it? Are they immune to all effects you create through a Haste action? Can you counterspell their spells? Can they ignore Hit Points you regain through a healing spell? What about Temporary Hit Points? Can you still be frightened by them if under Heroism? Does a weapon under the Magic Weapon spell count as a normal weapon? Can you apply the d4s from Bless to attacks against them and saving throws caused by them? Can you use the Extra Attack granted by Tenser's Transformation/Tasha's Otherworldly Guise against them? Do spells that allow you to use a different ability for attacks, like Tasha's Otherworldy Guise or Shillelagh, work? Do they ignore Circle Of Power when casting spells? Do they ignore AC bonuses from spells? What about a Plate Armor created through Fabricate? What about half-cover provided by Fizban's Platinum Shield? Are they still able to make an opportunity attack if you're under Kinetic Jaunt/Zephyr Strike/Ashardalon's Stride? Can you get advantage against them with True Strike? Do they ignore a Polymorphed creature's new statblock? Do they pass through pbstacles created by the Creation spell? Does a Continual Flame not provide light to them? Does Snare or Glyph of Warding go off when they touch it? Can they target creatures inside a Rope Trick spell? Do they ignore Death Ward or Sanctuary?

Unless you're willing to accept the in-game consequences.\nGenerally, anything in the spell description is fair game unless you want to abuse it.

                "body": "Ok, I had an extremely fun idea for a concept. Everyone is familiar with the ridiculous \"Small race mounted on Centaur\" shenanigan, but I thought of a way to further optimize it.\n\nWe have 2 PCs here: a Custom Race Fighter and a Centaur Monk/Cleric. Of course, this build would probably be used at its full potential on some level 20 one-shot, but it's still extremely fun.\n\nLet's start with PC 1, we'll call him Cowleen. Cowleen starts as a Custom Race (small size, preferably with darkvision) Fighter, and we take the Mounted Combatant feat. The feat is a must both thematically and mechanically, and we don't want our Monk friend to die until we get our hands on a certain legendary magic item. We take the Wildspacer background for Tough. We use Point buy to get STR 15/DEX 10/CON 15/WIS 14, and use our racial bonus to get to STR 17.\nAs we level up, we take the Cavalier subclass (obviously), the Defense fighting style (generic, but honestly the only option that actually matters), and the following Feats (not necessarily in order): Aberrant Dragonmark (Green-Flame Blade + Silvery Barbs), Warcaster, Piercer (STR), Dual Wielder, Magic Initiate (Wizard: Booming Blade + Silvery Barbs/Find Familiar) and +4 STR from ASIs.\nThe items we use are Belt of Dwarvenkin (to max out CON), Belt of Storm Giant Strength, Animated Shield, +3 Full Plate, +3 Rapier and Lance. Of course, if Belt of Storm Giant Strenght is there, we can dump STR if we wish so and focus on DEX/INT/WIS/CHA, but these will only matter for saves and initiative and we'll have a ton of options for saves so maxing STR anyway is just for the sake of simplicity or if you for some reason can't get any Belt of Giant Strength.\nWith this, our ability scores are STR 29/DEX 10/CON 20/INT 8/WIS 14/CHA 8. While dual wielding a Lance and a Rapier (which are both great for Piercer mounted Cavalier), and with our animated shield active, we have an AC of 25, and if we're worried about crits we still have a massive pool of 260+ Hit Points and Silvery Barbs (which are particularly useful due to the Cavalier's infinite-ish reactions). Our Silvery Barbs also recharges on a short rest, so it's always reliable.\n\nSince we're small, we can mount a Centaur, and they also have the right physiology for it. Also, with Mounted Combatant, our Centaur friend is immune to attacks as long as we're mounting them as we can just redirect the attack to ourselves (which is why they can mostly dump CON and still charge with us on their back), but we need health for that too (which is why Tough and a maxed CON early are necessary).\n\nNow let's look at PC 2, Irina. She starts as a Centaur (obviously), with a Point Buy array of STR 9/ DEX 15/INT 12/WIS 15/CHA 12. We dump CON because we mostly don't need to care about taking damage. We use our racial bonuses for +2 WIS and +1 DEX. Saves are an issue, however, so we go Astral Self Monk 19/Peace Cleric 1. Background doesn't really matter but Wildspacer is again good for Tough (not that we'll need it).\nFor Feats, we take: Mobile, Skill Expert (whatever/Athletics/WIS), Crusher (STR), and for ASIs +2 DEX and +2 WIS. For magic items, we take Ioun Stone of Agility (to max out DEX), Gloves of Soul Catching (duh), Dragonhide Belt (stunning strike and more Ki are always good), Horseshoes of Speed, and Saddle of the Cavalier (so our Small Cavalier doesn't fall). The small bonuses to our other ability scores are for carry capacity (STR, though not really necessary) and so we have decent Saves for most stuff.\nWith this, our ability scores are STR 10/DEX 20/CON 20/INT 12/WIS 20/CHA 12. Our defensive capabilities are mostly redundant due to an AC of 20, 240+ Hit Points, good saves, Evasion, Reflect Missiles, Mounted Combatant, Sanctuary, Bless, Emboldening Bond, Monk's invisibility, Gloves of Soul Catching's lifesteal, having Cowleen add 1d6 to our AC and give us resistance to all damage, and Saddle of the Cavalier. Even when not being mounted (aka never), we're effectively invincible.\nOur basic mobility is insane (110 feet of waking speed, we can ignore our negative equine build as Monks can walk vertically).\nOur spells don't really matter other than Bless, but Guidance is always good and even at lvl 1 clerics have a decent spell list to select from. You might like to cast Sanctuary on Cowleen on a pinch, maybe.\n\nNow, to the actual demonstration.\n\nThis build works insanely well against single enemies, but let's consider a situation where Cowleen is mounted on Irina and they're surrounded by 7 enemies.\nLet's assume our prep time (or just running around with our massive movement while buffing ourselves, really) allows us to have up Bless, Monk's invisibility, Emboldening Bond, and our Awakened Astral Body (shouldn't be that hard tbh) up by the time we actually engage in battle. With that, we have a +1d4 for grapple checks and +2d4 for attack rolls and saving throws, and Irina's attacks have advantage (and we do too if the enemies are smaller than her). We won't account for the very likely crits that will happen as we have such an insane amount of attacks.\nNotice that the Cavalier subclass works wonders by using forced movement, be it their own or the enemy's. I assume the way their features are worded is not RAI and likely an overlook, but who cares about RAI.\n\nIrina likely gets a good initiative, while Cowleen's likely last. Exactly what we want.\nIrina charges from at least 30 feet away into the 7 mooks and makes a single attack with her astral arms with stunning strike against Mook 1, which likely will get stunned. 3d10+5 force damage. She then attacks with her hooves, 1d10+5 bludgeoning + 2d10 force damage, and with Crusher she moves Mook 1 to the only unnocupied space here. Since forced movement works for us, we get an opportunity attack. With Warcaster, we can use our Rapier to cast a CON-based Green-Flame Blade instead of the opportunity attack. We get 3d8 fire + 1d8+12 piercing damage (and we can use Piercer to reroll if we roll low), and we can deal 3d8+5 fire damage to the nearby Mook 2. Simultaneously, we mark Mook 1, who now not only can't hit Irina, but has disadvantage to hit anyone but us (so no ranged attacks, haha). Also, since Cowleen moved 10 feet with Irina (technically forced movement, but again, RAW Cavalier doesn't care about that), we can simultaneously knock Mook 1 prone, which they won't be able to resist as they're stunned.\nIrina is only attacking with her Astral Self arms, so she can make 2 more attacks. She then grapples Mook 1, making them unable to stand up, and may try to attack, shove or grapple another enemy. All using Wisdom, so we don't need to worry about our low STR.\nIn one turn, ignoring additional sources of damage, we dealt at least 4d8+6d10+22 damage to Mook 1, which is now stunned, grappled and prone, and dealt an additional 3d8+5 to Mook 2. Beautiful.\nIrina ends her turn pretty satisfied. Mook 2, terrified by seeing Mook 1 get destroyed by Cowleen and apparently their invisible mount, tries to escape.\nExcept they don't. Cowleen hits them with their Rapier, dealing an additional 1d8+12 piercing damage and reducing their speed to 0. Or they can use Warcaster to deal an immediate 7d8 thunder damage in addition to the damage of the Rapier by casting Booming Blade. Either way, Mook 2 is shitting themselves by now, either being unable to escape or completely crushed by Booming Blade (and Irina hasn't even used her own opportunity attack). They might try to use the Disengage action, but they won't go far before dying. If they're within 10 feet, Cowleen's Lance will turn them into swiss cheese. And that is if Irina didn't grapple them first on her turn.\n\nMook 3 takes their turn. They're furious that we attacked their friends, and tries to hit the invisible horsewoman. They fail. If they somehow get through al the insane layers of protection Irina has, however, you can redirect the attack to you. Which will, obviously, miss. Mook 3 changes positions around to try to get a better angle for attacking... and Cowleen gets another free opportunity attack. Yet another Green-Flame Blade can be cast, dealing 3d8 fire + 1d8+9 piercing damage, and another 3d8+5 fire damage to Mook 1 or another nearby.\n\nRinse and repeat until Cowleen's turn comes.\nTime for Action Surge. Cue 8 attacks of 1d8+12 piercing damage each, at least one of which can has its damage rerolled with Piercer. You've got a +15+2d4 to hit, no way you're missing unless you're unlucky enough to roll a 1. And that's if you don't have advantage, which you can easily get through your familiar or if you used Silvery Barbs earlier. If you're worried about your Familiar, Sanctuary + disadvantage at marked enemy should be enough for you not to worry.\n\nNow, please tell me how stupid this is and why a ton of stuff I mentioned isn't RAW."

I figured she'd go away soon, so instead of saying anything and scaring the shit out of the poor girl I decided to wait.\n\nWell, my bag, with all my stuff, is still in a chair on the classroom, but the owner is nowhere to be seen.

Upon casting the spell in its altered form, however, you take 1d10 necrotic damage that cannot be prevented or reduced.\n\n\nTransmuter's Blood\n> Starting at level 6, you learn how to alter your spells with Transmutation magic by using your blood as a catalyst. \n\n> While your Mage Armor - Blood Armor is active and you're missing at least one Hit Point, you can make an special melee weapon attack: Blood Blade. It counts as a magic martial weapon attack which you're proficient with, uses your Intelligence modifier for attack and damage rolls, and deals 1d8 slashing damage on a hit. \n\n> You also learn the Booming Blade or Green-Flame Blade cantrip (your choice when you acquire this feature). It doesn't count against your known cantrips. You can make a Blood Blade attack as the attack required for the casting, and ignore the material components when you cast it this way. \n\n> Finally, the Ashardalon's Stride spell is added to your Spellbook, and is always prepared and doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare. When you cast it on its minimum level, you can choose to cast an altered form of the spell instead, as described below. \n\n> \u2022 Ashardalon's Stride - Oxygen Burner: The spell doesn't require concentration when you cast it this way, and can dismiss it as a bonus action. When the spell ends, however, you suffer one level of Exhaustion. If you don't need to breathe, or are unable to breathe for more than one round, the spell immediately ends.\n\n\nNecromancer's Blood\n> At level 10, your research on the arcane arts of Sangromancy deepens even further, now allowing you to understand the use of Sangromancy magic for Necromancy spells. \n\n> The Life Transference and Vampiric Touch spells are added to your Spellbook, and they're always prepared and don't count against the number of spells you can prepare. When you cast them on their minimum level, you can choose to cast an altered form of the spell instead, as described below. \n\n> \u2022 Vampiric Touch - Parasitic Blade (1/long rest): Immediately after hitting a creature with an attack of your Blood Blade, you can use your reaction to cast the spell, fusing it with your Blood Blade. The triggering hit with your Blood Blade, as well as any further attacks you make with it while maintaining concentration on the spell, also count as the melee spell attack required by the spell, and add the spell's damage on a hit (but no more than once per round). Healing acquired this way will always leave you with at least 1 missing Hit Point.\n> \u2022 Life Transference - Blood Transfusion (1/long rest): Immediately after hitting a creature with an attack of your Blood Blade, you can use your reaction to cast the spell. The creature is the source of the spell, instead of yourself.\n\n\nArcane Ascension\n> At 14th level, your dedication to Sangromancy has pushed your body past any normal limits of mortal endurance, and you now fully understand how the Stiphano family molded their arcane power.\nYour current and maximum Constitution score increase by 2. \n\n> You add your Intelligence modifier to your Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell, and add your Constitution modifier to Intelligence checks for or against spells (like Dispel Magic, Maze or Telekinesis) and Intelligence saving throws."

                "body": " \n\nThe Blood Mage has learned to turn their flesh, and even their own life force, into fuel for their spells. Due to the physically taxing nature of Blood Magic, a wizard looking to practice this art must undergo multiple rituals, which physically alters the way they think about and cast spells. This school of magic is closely tied to the Necromancy school, but focuses on redirecting the way necromantic magic afffects the blood within a creature's boy, rather than their life force.\n\n#### Blood Weapon\n\n>At level 2, when choosing this subclass, you learn to link your blood to the magic flow of the Weave.  \nYou can use a bonus action to spend one Wizard Hit Die and create a blade made with your blood in one of your free hands, your Blood Weapon. It counts as a magic simple weapon which you are proficient with, deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit, and uses your Intelligence modifier for attack and damage rolls.  \nThe weapon can also be used as an spellcasting focus for your Wizard spells.  \nThe weapon lasts for a number of turns equal to your Constitution modifier + your Intelligence modifier, and dissapears if you go unconscious or create another Blood Weapon.  \nThe damage of your Blood Weapon increases to 1d8 at level 6, 1d10 at level 10, and 1d12 at level 14.  \nYou also adquire proficiency in Constitution saving throws, and the Tough feat (if your table doesn't use the Feat optional rules, consider it as a plain increase in 2 Hit Points per level).\n\n#### Blood Armor\n\n>Also at level 2, you undergo necromantic rituals that allow your body to whistand the immense toll this branch of magic will have on it.  \nWhile you're not wearing armor or using a shield, are conscious, and are not under the effects of the Mage Armor or Barkskin spells, your AC equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your Intelligence modifier.  \nUndead, constructs and creatures with no blood cannot benefit from this feature.\n\n#### Exanguinate\n\n>At level 6, your continued ritualistic efforts have yielded results in manipulating your own blood and others'. You learn the Life Transference and Vampiric Touch spells, which are always prepared and don't count against the number of spells you can prepare.  \nWhen you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with an attack of your Blood Weapon, you can use a reaction to cast an altered form of the spells:  \n\u2022 Vampiric Touch: the triggering hit, as well as subsequent attacks of the spell while you maintain concentration, can be done as part of a weapon attack with your Blood Weapon (but no more than once per turn).  \n\u2022\u00a0Life Transference: You can force the creature to be the origin of the spell, instead of yourself. The spell fails and the spell slot and use of the ability are wasted if the creature is an undead, construct, or doesn't have blood.  \nWhen casted this way, the\u00a0spell is casted on their lowest level and spends a level 3 spell slot, as normal. Once you cast the altered form of one of these spells, you cannot use it again for that spell until you complete a long rest.\n\n#### Magic Blood\n\n>Starting from level 10, your research allows you to understand how to use your blood as a catalyst to empower your magic effects.  \nYou add your Intelligence modifier to your Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell, and add your Constitution modifier to your Intelligence (Arcana) and normal Intelligence checks.  \nYou also learn the Booming Blade or Green-Flame Blade cantrip (your choice). When you use your Blood Weapon to cast them, you ignore the cost of the material components.  \nIf your Blood Armor is active while holding your Blood Weapon, you gain a bonus of +2 to your AC.  \nFinally, you can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn, and you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks, provided any weapon attacks you make within this action are done with your Blood Weapon.\n\n#### Weave Veins\n\n>At 14th level, your dedication to blood magic has pushed your body past any normal limits of mortal endurance. The very essence of the Weave flows through your veins.  \nYour current and maximum Constitution score increase by 2.  \nOnce before a long rest, you can attempt to concentrate in two spells simultaneouly, provided both spells are of the 5th level or lower, aren't multiple castings of the same spell, and are of the same school.  \nWhen you cast the second spell, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, with DC equal to 16 + the combined level of the spells. On a success, you take 2d4 psychic and 2d4 necrotic damage, which cannot be prevented or reduced, and ignores temporary hit points; then you must succeed on a saving throw to maintain concentration, with DC equal to 8 + the damage taken. On a success, you can maintain concentration on both spells.  \nIf you fail the initial concentration saving throw, lose concentration, or one of the spells ends, both spells end, and you suffer one level of Exhaustion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFollowing a few tips I got on the initial concept for the subclass, I rebuilt it to not have permanent drawbacks anymore (the initial concept for the Blood Armor feature had permanent continuous damage during battle, for example). Since I was told the subclass offered too little (especially with the drawbacks), I tried making it more powerful."

I'm sitting on the toilet for hours with wave after wave of intense pain in my lower back, paired with some cramping in my abdomen. I'm also pooping out EVERYTHING in my system. I am talking 5.5 hours of pooping. \n\nI have my OBGYN appointment but the waves of pain are continuing. (Lol, it was contractions!) But no more poop is coming out. So what do I do? Give myself an enema \ud83e\udd74 I wait and wait and...no more poop comes out. Now I'm freaking out cuz I gave myself an enema and nothing comes out. \n\nGo to doc appointment. Get a membrane sweep. I'm 4cm dilated. Immediately I feel more intense cramping. What do I do? Go home \ud83e\udd74 (thankfully husband was driving) \n\nMy husband convinces me that I'm having contractions, but deep down I still think it's the enema causing pain. \n\nContractions range from 4-6 mins apart, so we go to the hospital. They confirm it's labor. I'm 6cm dilated. I power through labor for 6 more hours until all of a sudden BAM. \n\nSomeone is stabbing my lower back. The throbbing back pain was bad before, albeit tolerable, but now my spine is being pulled from my back. Nurse explains that baby has dropped down further and is sunny side up. We try counter pressure (doubled with heat packs I'd been using) but it barely helps. \n\nOn hour 15, I get the epidural. Immediate relief. But, it slows down contractions. 7 hours later, baby is born. \n\nAll the positions I prepped for were useless because they were meant for abdominal pains, not immeasurable back pain. \n\nLabor doesn't always go as planned. Mine didn't. I didn't expect to shit myself for half the day, or to get an epidural (I'm so glad I did, bless modern medicine). If you have back pain that's miles ahead of the contractions, you may be in back labor. Plan accordingly."

I know that means nothing really, but it doesn't help my psyche. \n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone has experiences delivering at Sinai and can share them (hopefully positive, haha) \n\nThanks!"

While most people didn't use the registry, most people didn't get me any outfits! \n\nI'm shocked! I had a shower with 25 ladies there and only FOUR got me baby outfits. I was also expecting a lot of baby blankets because I hear that a lot on this sub. Only got one! But I got a whole pile of swaddles and enough bath materials to last until the kid is 18. \n\nI've purposely been holding off on buying any clothing for the baby because I figured I'd get a boatload full at the shower. Nope. Now I get to have some fun at Target lol! \n\n(Not complaining. I just think it's funny. I'm guessing if I were having a girl maybe there might have been more outfits? Who knows)\n\nEDIT: I am NOT complaining. I had a wonderful shower and am very grateful for each and every gift I received. I just thought it was funny/different than I expected."

Now, Jester Confit does not start a chain so I'm confused about whether the effect of special summoning itself is considered an \"activated effect\" and would therefore trigger Pacifis or not.\nThe thing is, Tenyi cards do the exact same thing and they're even worded the same way but differently from Jester Confit they do start a chain so there's no doubt about those. Also they have an activation requirement while Jester Confit does not. Please send help\ud83e\udd72"

It\u2019s because people don\u2019t know very much about it that they are afraid and it\u2019s because people don\u2019t know they have it that it gets passed on.

And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment. And turn to All\u0101h in repentance, all of you, O believers, that you might succeed.\"",

It doesn't help that last year around the holidays I went through an extremely emotionally trying experience, so maybe I just associate Christmas with that now? I don't know. And another thing that really bothers me is that I have always hated how materialistic Christmas tends to be, and people try to act like it's this amazing time where people come together and everything is happy and joyful. I've gotten to point where now, whenever a Christmas song comes on the radio I immediately change the station. If someone is humming a Christmas song I leave the room. I watched It's A Wonderful Life again the other day, and I absolutely love that movie, but it stirred up so many sad memories and feelings I didn't want to think about. I was watching it with a bunch of other people (don't worry it was covid safe), so I was struggling the whole time just to NOT cry. After it was over I didn't say by to a single person I just went up to my room and cried on my pillow. And I hate how emotional I've been lately because I tend to focus a lot on logic and feelings are almost never logical...\n\nWell that's all. I'm not asking for help, because I already have help from other sources, but I was just feeling sad right now and wanted to write it down if that makes any sense."

But let's look at it from a different perspective. \n\nLoki, whilst being a prankster, wasn't really evil. He was friends with Odin, Tyr, Freya and Thor. He was also the father of Fenrir. Odin hated Fenrir and killed him, which had no real valid reason. This is more than enough for Loki to hate Odin, but also the fact that everyone was still good with Odin makes Lokis hate even more understandable. He was betrayed by all of his friends and wants revenge. \n\nWhen Loki took over Basim, he only saw Eivor as Odin and no one else, it only makes sense that he wants vengeance for his son. He isn't evil, he just loved his son and hated betrayal. Lokis actions can be justified from this. I don't think Basim/Loki is evil, just an antagonist to Eivor. I'm excited to see how he is in the next game, maybe we'll even see a mental battle between Loki and Basim. \n\nAlso side note, this may be completely impossible but might as well throw it in. Fenrir is known for swallowing a sun. Desmond absorbed a solar flare. Is there any link here?"

I have 180h on the game right now and I still think I will continue to play it for a while\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTier A:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYakuza 6, so I don't think this game is really much appreciated by the community but to me it did everything right, we don't have to play anyone else than Kiryu but I think it suits the story and show how he has only one option to get out, bringing peace to the orphanage and all the peoples he knows, the Dragon engine is really showing here and we get to see it as it's peak I feel, only things I didn't like that was Oroshima as little to offer in content for mini games other than the fishing one that is really fun if you are in this kind of stuff, some events are really coming out of nowhere and just give a factor of urgency that is really above other games in the series\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYakuza og, this game has really aged and is hard to play without \"mods\" as it's 4/3 aspect ratio and Kiryu feels like a truck to control, however the story and craziness of Japan is very well represented especially for the time\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYakuza Kiwami 1&2, so I group them as they are really similar on how the gamplay is and also how the different factions are presented, their story are really different tho and on this side, I feel 1 has a lot more to offer, Nishikiyama arc is really depressing and I wish it would have ended differently but we don't always get what we want if life and I think that's one of the point of the entire series that I will come back to later, otherwise the mini games are great, the Dragon engine is fun to play with and see enemies ragdolling but there is some issue I think where you can get soft locked by miniguns foes that will just stun lock you and the use of weapon is the easiest way to skip combat (now that I think of it's also present in Y0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYakuza 2 (og), so I didn't finish this one but finished the Kiwami version of it, I feel that even if the game bring more of the good stuff we had in the first one the story kind of lost itself into becoming too convoluted for it's on good, it's not bad by any mean but since we have the Kiwami version now I would recommend to go that way instead\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYakuza 3, sadly this game didn't got a true Kiwami edition but the remaster is fine enough, I enjoyed this game a lot even if it's far from perfect, I know a lot of people don't like the orphanage arc but to me it really consolidates on who Kiryu is and why he is making the choices that he does. Okinawa is a nice change of location and overall all the side characters and the story is really good  \n\n\nTier C:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYakuza 5, to me this game was almost perfect, I enjoyed every part of the story, every mini game, every activities until the end of the Tatsuo Shinada arc (also btw, where has this dude gone? Why?) but after that the ending get really too much, dragging and dragging it made me want to skip dialogues and I think it's an indication that it's not good righting at least to me\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTier D:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYakuza 4, this is the only game of the series (other than Y2 og) that I couldn't finish, half way trough I just quit and watched the story on Youtube, the game wasn't bad by any means but it didn't bring enough to be a new game I feel, the story was convoluted for no reason and the villains where boring at best, I checked the videos of the story to be sure to not miss anything for Y5 but even that was meh\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis complete story really resonate with me as at it's core it's a story about orphans trying to survive and do good even if the context they are placed in make them do terrible things or having to choose between the worst of two evils, I think Yakuza 0 nails it the best and that we can see how the direction of the series is going to change from this game onwards, I find it really sad that the voice actor and model from Judgment is preventing the game to come on PC for BS reasons and I hope to play it one day, I think the part I enjoy the most about all theses games is how they presents rejects of society and make us feel for them, they are not the best but they try to do their best and that's what matters, the part I liked the least are the grindy part, it's just not for me so I don't know if I will feel brave enough to 100% one of theses games, overall I would give this series a big recommendation to play like a 95/100 for anyone as when you start to dig into it it's not just about Japan or anything it's about people and that's also why I put 7 in S tier, their isn't that much RPG other than Persona that is going to put rpg element in an IRL setting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPhew this was a long review, I hope you enjoyed reading it, plz feel free to disagree as I really want to post this to have different pov anyway if you read all that thx a lot and stay safe everyone and I can't wait for Y8!"

And to tell you honestly all of the stoic teachings I barely learned before just got thrown out the window. \n\nI love her too much for me not to succumb feeling extreme misery from her slow decline and to her eventual death even though I understand that all living things will end one day and nothing is forever in this physical realm. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is it's ok to let the waves of grief crash into you. It will settle down sooner or later. For me I'm still at the stage where the strong waves crashes over me again and again and I wont try to fight it anymore. Like instead of being against the strong gust of wind I'll sway with it instead. And maybe this could be the most stoic thing I can do. \n\nAnd I just try to remember that at least her last moments here wasn't as sudden and tragic. She left peacefully without any more pain and suffering. \n\nShe wasn't hit by a car or got attacked by other animals. She didn't get poisoned or drowned etc... \nShe didn't die too young or too old. \n\nShe at least gave me time to prepare. Even though the pain of losing her is unbearable most times. But I still consider myself lucky that she returned the way she returned and that she gave me 13 wonderful, joyous years of her life with me.",

I dunno if I can give an effective tip/advice for you but probably you just have to let the grief flow within you. If you need to cry, just cry. Let the waves of grief crashes over you so it will eventually wash away the sorrow you feel at the moment, bit by bit. It takes time but the waves will subside and starts to calm down.

She just got pickier with her food and the meds are supposed to stimulate her appetite but it's getting really hard to feed her. The vet just said that I should force her to eat her medicated canned food, tried that and she just spits it out, tried mixing it with her more fav dog food but she can tell and still won't eat it and now she doesn't want to eat her fav canned food anymore. It's getting really frustrating and she needs to eat so she can take her meds. I tried feeding her a bit of boiled chicken liver and she likes that a lot but the vet insist I shouldn't give human food to her so I'm in my wits end here.\n\nAside from all that it just breaks my heart seeing her like this. She has never had any major sickness until now and I think it's making me really, extremely anxious dealing with it. She also brings the only joy I have in this house. I've been really depress lately and I'm living with a bunch of miserable people as well. She's basically my only hope of getting me out a bit of the darkness and now she's not feeling well. I cry every single night. I always feel like my chest is gonna burst open with worry. \n\nI also have to acknowledge that's she's getting old as well and I might have to mentally prepare myself for when she's not here anymore. But I can't even handle the mere thought of this. \n\nHow do/did you deal with all this?? I need to know if someone in here had experienced or experiencing the same situation? \n\nAnd thank you in advance!"

I can't help but cry my eyes out all the time coz the sadness is so visceral and overwhelms me too much. Lalo pag na papakinggan ko mga kanta ng Beach House, Ewan ko ba there's just something about their songs that would make me feel extreme sadness without fail. I guess I'm on that point in my life na sobrang nag sisink in na saken that every present moment will be a past memory one day and that it would never happen again in my lifetime. When I think about this sobrang naiiyak ako especially regarding love ones like my parents and baby girl(pet) they are not getting any younger and there would be a day na they too would become a past memory. Every good,bad,beautiful and ugly things in my life right now will soon past and fade away and the thought of these simply overwhelms me to my core. And I feel like prng hnd ko sya kakayanin and the anxiety and paranoia that accompany these thoughts aren't helping at all as it could happen any day now. I'm trying to handle this by also being aware na I will too cease to exist, that every single one of my thoughts,memories and consciousness will just be simply gone one day so none of these really matters in the end. Pero ang problema kse dto is kung ano ba ang mauuna. Anyways I guess I can't articulate myself well enough here pero un nga I just want to get these off my chest lalo wla ako masabihan dto at sana mabawasan nmn kht papano by conveying my emotions into words, ayw ko dn ma judge by having these \"killjoy\" thoughts ngayun holiday season samen.

                "body": " I just kinda want to rant and vent and also have some advice on how not to be affected when people think having huge legs on a girl is abysmal. \n\nMy family, most especially my older sisters will give me shit about having large legs for my body type all the time in diff. stages of my life. They aren't the only one who notices how huge my legs are actually, other people too as well but my family ofcors will have the guts to shame me for it. My 2nd oldest sister would tease me about how I look like I have Elephantiasis on my legs and she's the worst to insult me coz she has the slimmest body type among us and doesn't get that fat often.  the eldest one isn't so direct but she also thinks that huge legs are ugly, she's actually the bulkier than all of us and even have larger legs than mine but that doesn't stop her to make me feel like shit about it too. \n\nI have tolerated my own sisters bringing me down all my life about how I look. Having huge legs isn't the only one they tried so hard to make me feel bad about but also for having a huge nose and dark skin. But that deserves another post of its own on how worst it is. What triggered me to finally get this off my chest was the event that took place earlier. So me, mom and oldest sister were eating on this restaurant. My sister took a picture of me in there and after that we went to another store and I asked her if I could see the picture she took and I noticed that she didn't include my legs, and you know what her answer was?? Instead of just simply admitting that's she's shit in taking pictures, she wants to act as my saviour saying that she doesn't want to include  my huge legs in the picture, implying that it's not pretty to look at. And I was like are you fucking kidding me!!??? I then proceeded to tell her that I am proud of my legs and that I'm not ashamed of it. She then just meekly laughed it off. I was just so out of words that she herself shares the same trait as I for having huge, fat, legs and it's even bigger than mine but still shame me for it. How does a person do that??? I'm just so honestly disturbed by this. \n\nAt this point I just surrender to the fact that my own blood will be also the very people that will tear my already endangered and flimsy self-esteem apart with no mercy. This is such a classic case of that saying \"the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\". Idc if it's actually that or not but in my experience I can surely attest that was actually the genuine truth. \n\nI've experienced other people who I didn't share a womb with actually make me feel better with having huge legs. Like one of my classmates was complaining about how she has huge legs and I joined her with her complaint then what she said shocked me. She said that it actually fits me and it's not something I should change about myself. And that's just one example. \n\nI dunno ofcourse other people will feel more cautious to be more brutally Frank with strangers than their own family. But i guess there's also truth on how others can see something on you that they think will make you feel bad and tease you for it like with bullying or an offhand comment and not once I experienced others saw and made my huge legs as ammo for themselves to feel better and turn it against me for the sole purpose of hurting me. Not once. But i dunno why its such an issue in our society that even your own family will give you flack about it for just simply existing with legs that just happens to be huge."

                "body": "The reason of such suggestion comes from my personal experience in ranked and ranked practice, I feel like there is something wrong with how people play as vigilante due to current meta. Almost no one wants to shoot and risk, and it's very hard to scumread since there are 3 RT roles. I've seen a lot of games where vigilante doesn't want to risk shooting someone, even if there are 4 town members dead on day 3, where the game becomes 5 vs 6 (5 town members+4 mafia, NE and NK (SK in such case), they can vote jailor that revealed himself day 1 and hang him, but that rarely happens for some reason) and at the same time it still unknown who is actually RT here. Jailor sometimes might be useless if he is really bad player or it's just hard for him to process results or scumreading by himself. \n\nSo I suggest next: \n\nver 1.0 - Ability to read mafia chat at night permanently, except the nights when vigilante gets jailed. \n\nThat sounds pretty OP for me. So I don't recommend this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nver 1.1 - Ability to read mafia chat at upcoming night by pressing sun icon on day. Can be only used once \\[or maybe twice, but if there are 2-3 vigs in a match, it might be very problematic for mafia\\]. If vigilante gets jailed on upcoming night, he won't be able to read mafia chat, but doesn't lose count of available usage of reading mafia chat at night \\[or simply saying: he can press on sun icon again\\].\n\n!!-- I feel like this is the best option for vigilante, mafia never knows when vigilante wants to listen to them. --!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nver 1.2 - exactly like 1.1, except vigilante won't be able to shoot at night while he listens to mafia, but if he gets controlled by witch, he will still shoot second target. \n\nThis one doesn't seem for me game-changing, especially in late game. So I can't recommend this rework version either. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you think vigilante needs ability to read mafia chat at night? Does it ruin concept of his Town Killing nature, and so he doesn't need ability that comes from Town Investigative? How influencial reading mafia chat can be (Please do not compare this to spy's ability reading mafia chat that was long time ago, since those were really different times) ? Should this rework come together with retributionist rework, or you think it could be changed right now?\n\nPersonally I think mafia and vigilante both get benefits from this: smart mafia can fool vigilante by typing in their chat false info and nonsence, and so by that they can influence vig to shoot wrong person; a smart vigilante can correctly scumread and finally be able to get orientation of who's very likely to be evil and who's likely to be town, AND a smart mafioso that claimed vig can also type wrong information for town of what he read from mafia chat. Vigilante players maybe finally will stop being so passive by keeping those 3 bullets until late game comes.  \n\nShare your own suggestions and thoughts on this rework."
