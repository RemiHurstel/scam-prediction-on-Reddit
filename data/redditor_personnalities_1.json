However they did tel me that while they believe it all, they don\u2019t actually practice it, they told me in their own words exactly, that they enjoy their sin and don\u2019t see an issue with it following their urges and ignoring the God they believe exists. What\u2019s the reasoning? You believe in God, and believe that deliberately sinning will offend him, you acknowledge this and continue to do it. This isn\u2019t a \u201cthis guy sins he sucks\u201d it\u2019s a \u201cwhy\u201d thing. \nI don\u2019t want to rag on him, I just can\u2019t comprehend why you would deliberately try to offend the God you believe in, and believe your urges are above what God wants for you."

                "body": "A lot of people have far more interesting stories than this but after seeing a Radio TTS vid i decided to maybe put something up here.\n\nIslam is very... controversial. I wouldn't consider myself an ex-musljm of any sort, but i used to be muslim nonetheless and know how much of an impact it is when you remember your childhood. \n\nI was born and raised Muslim, and the older i got, the more restrictions there would be. Typical ones like dating, wearing decent clothes, etc. \n\nDuring my teenage years i went to a private school where i was memorizing the Quran because i thought it would be a good idea. Little did i know what would come with it. \n\nAround my third year of being in that school, i made online friends due to the limitations of human interaction at school, so i was already in touch with the so-called real world. I didn't have to fit in either, i knee that there would be people that d share the same expressions and mindset as I did somewhere in the world. \n\nI eventually ditched the friends and got into things like the darknet, and that honestly was traumatizing (now I'm desensitized), but not enough to question my faith in God. \n\nI never questioned it. I just never built it. Everytime I tried to build it, it would shatter right in front of me. And it wasn't even because I asked for things and didn't get them. I just saw no point in doing something for someone who brought us here because he was bored. \n\nApparently he was never born and will never die, there is no one like him, and he brought people as a test. What was the purpose of creating people then if you call yourself merciful and yet 80% of mankind go to hell? \n\nI remember this one incident in school where i used to always clean the mosque and one of the teachers told me to do it in the name of reward. I told her, that was never my intention, it's just dirty and the students need a clean place to live. She said that if you don't do it in the name of reward you don't get any reward. And i said good, i didn't do it for the reward. It wouldn't affect me if i got reward or not. That seemed to piss her off, but i didn't think much of it. Now, the more I debate with people about Islam, the more it becomes prominent that the religion has taught us to be selfish human beings who only do things when they are given something in return. \n\nIf you ask God for happiness, you have to worship him and do good deeds in return. Because he wants worship and you want happiness. This sounds healthy but the deeper you dig down, the worse it got. \n\nAlso, there were stories that on the day of judgement, everyone will be so frantic to the point that mothers will forget their kids even exist and abandon them after stealing their rewards. That to me is very absurd and it sounds like \"god\" fetishised people in misery. Otherwise, why would the world always have conflict?\n\nLittle things like these eventually came to me and taught me that as long as you're s decent person, you don't have to be a true believer. Because in islam, nobody knows their a true believer till the end of the world. Like, doesn't that sound like...misleading to you? \n\nAlso, people act like everything is in the quran and hadith, but when you ask scholars, they assess controversial topics/grey areas based on their own opinions. Like homosexuality. My parents have thought for long enough i was in the closet only because i defend the LGBTQ+ community everytime they'd make inhumane remarks. That to me just shows how toxic and blinding this religion is. The fact that my parents, in which one of them doesn't even pray coz they have a narcissistic problem that everyone but they see, says these things about other people who are just trying to live their lives because what, \"god made you for who you are?\" Is that your argument? Who made god then, why is he so indestructible? When you raise questions like these people tend to either get pissed because they're too emotionally invested, or they say that it is beyond our comprehension. \n\nI had s debate with a therapist about Islam VS. atheism where she was defending islam and i was defending atheism. Of course, every side has it's arguments that can get them to win, so i was naturally able to look on both sides, which helped me not be blind sighted by emotions and able to win a debate every single time. After her saying things like \"thinking there is no god coz you have a God Complex is arrogant in my opinion\" i had to say dumb things like \"who said you have to have s god complex, you can just be finding your logical way and end up in this stage as well.\" And how \"religion is a false hope for people who need something to live their lives for and feel as though they have some sort of purpose at the end when in reality, there could be nothing afterward.\" She said things like there were miracles proving that god was real and such but i said things like how would you know of they were real. So many other religions that you believe aren't true have been there before this newfound islam that you know today, you don't know if it actually happened or if someone just made s cult of it and stuff, you know typical arguments. \n\nShe eventually lost the debate but i knew the point that would defeat mine. So i told her frustrated self that i would've ended the debate as her side by saying that \"Islam's first pillar is faith. If you don't have that, you don't have the rest of islam.\" And she just sat there, her face becoming colorless and just looking like she was about to cry. I don't like doing this and putting people through an existential crisis but if they continuously try to challenge me and threaten me that their religion is the best and i suck because I'm too arrogant, that's when I'll bite back, coz they are asking for it. \n\nPeople also tend to personally attack me using my past of islam against me but little do they know that it doesn't affect me at all because i am not as emotionally invested in god or trauma as they are. They also like to believe in god to rain down solutions when it's right in front of them. So how does that make me arrogant?\n\nIdk, in just going here and there coz there are too many things to talk about. So if you have any questions just let me know and I'll get back to anything.\n\n\n(Edit)\nI see the comments now and i could have defended it in a better way only because i am concrete in the fact that i officially do not believe in any religion or God. Before, i wasn't too sure which is why I wasn't prepared for this, and it isn't an excuse but a form of growth as this was my first discussion (or rather \"argument\") on islam."

Specifically the part where they force the enemies out and then remain independent. Aside from the fact that getting armies isn't exactly difficult, someone from a planet is unable to attack orbital ships, which is also why bombarding the planet is such an easy (and well working) option\n\nThis isn't a \"oh the game should be like that\" and more of a \"it kinda sucks that the stories don't fully align with the game\"",

I wasn't super invested in the plot, but I was definitely curious, so I was watching and watching and after a couple episodes of season one, i fell in love. I absolutely loved the ending and I thought Walters death was a little sad, but he's also a murderer, I was just shocked when Skyler figured out he was a drug dealer when he asked about the cell phone, and overall it was just a really Fantastic tv show. My rating for the show has to be a 10/10."

Easy.\" Obviously, this means I will need to open it up. However, when I received it I noticed there is one major problem: the back/battery casing on the 3ds is stuck.\n\nMost of the screws holding it in place are stuck/stripped, and since they're inset into the casing i came to the conclusion that i am going to have to destroy the back casing in order to open the 3ds (yes, i did try every method of getting the screws out before coming to this conclusion). I already ordered a new back casing, but I'm also going to have to replace the stripped screws. Does anyone know where I can buy *just* the replacement screws for the 3ds?\n\nI keep finding listings for 3ds XL screws, but I dont know if any of those will fit a regular old 3ds. The one listing I did find for 3ds screws was like 10 bucks, which i think is a ridiculous price for a few tiny screws. Any help is much, much appreciated."

Does this matter though, because it\u2019s Russia? \n\nAlso what about the negative fall out if Eurovision bans it? \n\nEither way, the people in charge of these decisions lose and it\u2019ll cause a shit storm.

I have a old dell laptop which now runs linux because it ran like crap on windows, a desktop PC with Pop_OS! and a OnePlus 7 pro.\n\nI study engineering (management). I need a device that's light and portable and has a good battery life. I'll have to do some coding in the next years and probably some cad but mainly carrying it around using it to look at my notes.\n\nEver since these new m1 devices have come out my **impression** is that they kinda destroyed the competition at that price point and in the thin and light form factor. I'm looking for any other option because I'm not someone that likes to waste his money, but at the moment it's hard for me to pick a device and go \"that's clearly better than the M1 Air\".\n\nI know the rule of thumb is \"never buy version 1 of anything\", i fully understand it, but I need a laptop now. Thank you for your help!"

One of my Nezha builds, my General Use build, is currently on place 6 regarding rating of all time.\n\n[My General Use build](https://preview.redd.it/luo649pjsac91.jpg?width=1110&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9007477514a1abe3e7bcb5cd1188dbe3a6bfa12f)\n\nTo give a short summary, we run all 3 **Umbral mods** as Nezha can use Health, Armor and Ability Strength very well, we use **Adaptation** to further increase our eHP (effective HP), we use **Transient Fortitude**, **Power Drift** and **Augur Secrets** to increase our Ability Strength further and **Primed Continuity** to counter the negative Ability Duration from Transient Fortitude, giving us some nice quality of life with the now slighty positive Ability Duration (127.5%). **Equilibrium** seems underrated as a lot of builds appear to run Primed Flow, Streamline or even both. With the help of Blazing Chakram we generate a lot of health orbs and energy orbs, meaning we never really run out of energy. Equilibrium also helps with our aura mod **Combat Discipline**, which we run in combination with **Arcane Avenger**. Due to us losing 10 health on every kill with Combat Discipline, we can always pick up health orbs, meaning more energy thanks to Equilibrium. **Arcane Energize** is not needed for this build and can be changed to other arcanes like Arcane Guardian for more armor.\n\n[Here is the full guide](https://overframe.gg/build/188323/nezha-prime/nezha-prime-config-a-general-use-endgame/) if you want to read more.\n\nIf you made it to this point, thanks for reading and I would love to see comments on my build; positive or negative."

I'm a huge fan of Divinity: Original Sin 2.\n\nHere are things I would like to have in the system:\n\nRequirements\n- Fantasy\n- Round based\n- Character levels\n- Races\n- Martial and Caster balance\n- Multiple actions per turn/action points (like PF2e/DOS2)\n- Movement takes actions (unlike 5e)\n- Characters can't simply hide behind high Armor Class or similar (unlike in 5e)\n- Dice\n\nBonus points if\n- Turn based\n- Classes\n- Unused actions increase number of reactions\n- (Some) unused actions can be used in the next turn (like DOS2)\n\nFor people who have experience with 4e and/or PF2e, how well are my wishes expressed in the systems? In general, I'm very much open to other systems that are not 4e or PF2e as well.\n\nThanks a lot for any help!"

I'm doing It mainly for the health benefits since I suffer from PCOS, depression, anxiety and sleeping issues.. When I fast for religious beliefs, I notice I get my periods and I have impeccable sleep! So keto and IF must be the missing gem for me. For the electrolytes mix I can't find them in my country and shipping is extremely expensive, I currently take 300mg Magnesium with some b12 at night. I ordered wheatgrass powder and nutritional yeast, I take 300mg of calcium from cheese what's left now is Potassium.. how much do I need of potassium? and is there another electrolyte I don't know about? please help me"

My parents didn't believe me and would dismiss me, when they'd wake up and I tell them I haven't slept yet, they'd get very mad and my dad would say: \"I'd hit you like men do so you'd sleep\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith time it became physical and I developed a severe depression. While I did low-key get out of the situation, whenever I'm happy it can instantly turn into a 2-3 days mental breakdown when my parents raise their hands or threaten me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCould it be that I have complex PTSD? I'm also always on hypervigileance mode(I thought everyone was like this? It actually surprised me when people wouldn't be aware of their surroundings), dissociative, reclusive, big loner and have anxiety. I don't feel at ease when I'm in the same room as my mom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday my dad was mad at me so he pushed and insulted me and I instantly started crying and my head started hurting. Today, I woke up to just stay in my bed crying. Then my mom and sister came into my room to judge me and tell me I'm being dramatic and I'm just acting, then my mom said; I'll hit you and raised her hand on me and I started crying, my head started hurting a LOT and I had a panic attack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCorporal punishment is a common practice in my country and my family have abused me physically, mentally, sexually and emotionally since I was a kid, my classmates bullied me through primary and middle school so staying on my own was a normal thing. If it's a common punishment and most kids who've experienced it are okay now( my siblings included) then why did it affect me so much? I can't even remember I have memory loss and whenever I try going back to my past my head start hurting and I have a breakdown. I do remember few episodes and that I tried suicide at 8 but like... my parents didn't have a choice either, my mom was ill at the time, my abuse was just me at the wrong time, I was an extremely disciplined and mature kid for my age and never caused any troubles but my mom would hit me for the silliest of reasons, once I asked her if we could write a letter, she made me trip and stepped on me until I couldn't breathe etc...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease help me. idk what's wrong with me."

Dottore should be the next and plot wise they\u2019ll probably make one of his segments the playable one.\n\nFor the not confirmed, Pulcinella has high chances of being confirmed too near Snezhnaya just for his presence in the Teyvat chapter trailer. Capitano if he gets enough hype from the players might become playable confirmed as Mihoyo don\u2019t hesitates with opportunities.\n\nThe least likely are Pierro and Signora. At least I hardly see them playable before the end of the Teyvat chapter.",

When i was 10, my dad, lets call him wilma, left me.\nHe worked at a CD store, and ever since i was born, he hated having a kid. So he left to Europe, and left my mom and me. Being from a sugondese culture, I am able to deal with lots of tough loses. But this was way harder than any other ordeal i had been in. So my mom took me to wendys, my favorite fast food place, while an imagine dragons song was on the radio. This was all during the ligma pandemic, which had already put a huge toll on my mom. Plus, just the stigma of my dad leaving left a mark on me, since i think it was my fault. Anyway, i just wanted to vent since this has been crippling me for a while.\n\nCredit: u/thiagoA1cantara"

On a human scale we seem to have free will, on a scale of physics, it doesn't seem that we have free will. Considering that the debate about free will often comes down to whether or not we should be held morally responsible for our actions (which is a human scale question), I believe that we should stick to the human scale when discussing free will. This leads me to the conclusion that we do in fact have a form of free will. This is a type of compatibalism.\n\nObviously not everyone is going to agree.

However, if you mean general life satisfaction, then probably yes. And it was probably before agriculture or at least urbanisation (about 10,000 years ago). Anatomically modern humans have lived for about 200,000 years and we did not evolve for city life. Most hunter gatherer peoples would have had a strong feeling of meaning and purpose in there lives, something that contemporary people can struggle to achieve, they would have had a strong connection to the world around them, and a sense of their place as part of that world. Yes it is true that the chances of you randomly dying would have been higher, you wouldn't live to be as old, and you wouldn't have access to the luxuries and knowledge we have today, but you would likely have more meaning and sense of connection than many people do today. It is also worth noting that some tribes/bands would have been worse to live in and same with some time periods i.e. the Younger Dryas cold snap. \n\nAlso, something we do have today that no other time period can claim, is our ability to individually change our life circumstances if we don't like them. This can be hard and potentially impossible for some people, as there are many structures and social pressures in the way, but it is something few people in history could do. \n\nSo anyway, it depends how you define a good life, we have many advantages in the modern era, but perhaps archaic humans had more meaning in their lives.",

Furthermore, my partner, who I am traveling with, managed to secure Student Accommodation and so if i cancel my exchange, we will be forced to go long distance in our relationship, which is undesirable for both of us. If anyone has a spare room and is willing to host a foreign student I would be incredibly grateful. I am willing to pay up to 700 euros per month.\n\nA bit about me:\n\nI love hiking, rock climbing, and other outdoor activities, as well as reading and playing music. I am also curious, philosophical, and keen for adventure! I enjoy spending time with housemates and like sharing meals ( I am happy to cook), while also appreciating my own and respecting others alone time.

It\u2019s odd, because it feels so fundamental and I always take it for granted.\n\nA week is shaped like a flattened oval structure. On top is the weekend, Saturday and Sunday, that spiral around tightly into Monday and then eventually into Friday in a clockwise fashion. Weekend on top, week on bottom. Like an uneven clock.\n\nFor months, January at the top left, December at the bottom right. Months are in rows, like a typical calendar. Days are packed inside each month, but are only looked at when considering specific/individual months. There\u2019s like a\u2026 bigger on the inside effect to the representation of days in each month. Like a Tardis, idk. \n\nThe year 0 of Christ\u2019s birth is at the top left, the current century is at the bottom right, like with January and December in a single year. The years in between progress in rows - like with months, only it doesn\u2019t reset at the end of a cycle (because years are tallying/cumulative and only internally cyclical). All years Before Christ (BC) exist on the same row; it\u2019s like only what comes after that is actually organised, naturally.

They like the way she dresses and looks but she doesn't give them what they want so they talk badly about her out of petty revenge. \n\nBetween the general stigma against revealing clothes and scorned parties the poor opinion of her spreads.",

If you keep using conditioner/mousse/any product, *without cleaning your scalp thoroughly*, it can damage your hair.

It should help me write really fast (like glide over the paper). Preferably 0.5mm tip, ink pen (roller), but ballpen would do. \n2. It should be waterproof (and preferably fade-proof). \n\nOptional: If the pen comes with a gripper, then fabulous. But if it doesn't, I will find a way. \n\nHomework I have done till now:\n\n1. My favourite pen is Pilot Tecpoint V5. Till date, nothing has come close to the level of glide this one provides. But the biggest con is that it is **not waterproof**. I looked for the waterproof variant, but couldn't find. If there is one, please please please let me know. \n2. Tried Reynolds Gel Racer, Pentonic Ball Pens, Luxor Gelo One, Faber Castell Liquid Ink Roller Pen, Elkos Orio and other variants, Natraj FluidX, Cello Octane, Uni-ball Eye UB-150, Uni-ball Air variants. Results have been meh. Either the ink is not waterproof or my fingerpads hurt while writing. \n\nMy budget: Maximum price per pen I am willing to splurge is Rs. 100. Lower the better. I need at least 10-15 of these pens, so my budget is constrained. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance! :)"

So, I was hoping to sub out the moisturisers for oils. \n\nPlease suggest me some good oils that don't block pores and how to incorporate them into the routine.

                "body": "Good morning there,\n\n\nI'm looking to design a cover for 90 foot by 65-foot area. My team has put up a spine of scaffolding down the 90-foot centre line and suspended at 28 feet above the deck on four load-bearing scaffold towers.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0We initially looked into a complete pre-constructed structure and roof system that we would place and remove as our concrete slab pours required with our mobile crane. For the practicality of storage and the frequency of application, the team will construct and set a spine with roll-out tarps attached to it.\n\n\n\u00a0Given the size of this apparatus, it's an undertaking to realize the deployment and recovery of the tarps that will create the shelter.\u00a0 Which has fallen to me since everybody else has deemed it \"easy.\"\u00a0\n\n\nI started with tensioned guide wires from the spine to the sidewall to help support the tarp. To recover some of the bowl effects, we were looking at having net bold intention from the spine to the sidewall. That's about all I have for understructure right now.\n\n\n\u00a0The team purchased (6 qty) 40 by 60-foot industrial tarps. Under usual tarp conditions, most people use the tension inside the tarp itself to keep it aloft with corner guidelines; given the span of each compartment, 40 feet by 40 feet, a Supportive understructure is part of the design effort. A suspended snow fence to use as grid is my thought.\n\n\nThe purpose of this rain protection is to cover finished concrete and protects the Pour while placing. We will be placing with pumper truck from a crane boom. Each section of the tarp will have to recover and deploy. Pulling it open with ropes is an apparent first approach. With finished concrete below and no access, there's the risk of either dropping a tarp or the large span of 40 feet being challenging to manage at height.\n\n\n\u00a0So I'm looking for solutions to open and close the tarp compartments. I've considered either the harkyn type system, McGregor folding hatch type system, or Wykeham-Martin wire-style roller.\n\n\nMy work is a commercial construction application, so I do have budget available to me. My budget limits are based on reputation and not so much expense. We're hoping to reuse the system several times, so it needs to be robust. But it can't break the bank either. We have rejected some ideas, such as a permanent scaffold created structure that can be removed and placed with a crane. And we've rejected scaffold Joisting as opposed to the tension cable stays.\n\n\nThe first of 24 applications will be on the 9th of November. We very well may open and close the compartment sections with nothing but guide ropes and wrangle tension. Perhaps a few pulleys.\n\n\nThere's a crew of skilled labour, about seven people, to operate. At times there will be an overhead crane, but there are several use cases where the apparatus will be outside of the crane reach radius.\n\n\n\u00a0Right now, I'm thinking of having a roller furler inside a cradle constructed primarily out of plywood and connected to the spine board on catwalk brackets or possibly scaffold decking. Roller furling drums would be assembled at the ends and middle of the PVC horizontal cable stay for each compartment.\n\n\n\u00a0I'm open to thoughts or suggestions, which is why I wrote it, and I have some rudimentary drawings.\n\n\n\u00a0I mean, I might need a little bit more than luck to get this completed, possibly even some engineer approval, since there will be overhead work.\n\n\n\u00a0Let me know what you think.\n\n\nFeel free to reach out,\u00a0\n\n\n604 704 2504\n\nDirk Becker\u00a0"

So I gave ownership of the process to the duties, rather than to myself personally.   \n\n\nGrammatically incorrect or not, I chose to keep it, and said so - she had already withdrawn at this point and was easily seen to be upset and disturbed that I had not taken her direction.   \n\n\nI offered a not so dissimilar explanation as the above, and was a little incredulous - where i offered to substitute \"duties for My Role\" rendering the sentence acceptable to the judging reading public to whom would have otherwise ejected me from society otherwise.   \n\n\nShe spent the rest of the evening stonewalling physically, and refused to have any of our evening discussion or banter, refused to cuddle when i had politely offered.   \n\n\nI felt like this isn't a first, where she is very easily upset by my non-standard approach.   \n\n\nShe even left a message with me this morning that seemed over the top dramatic to me - and it is really hard to repair feelings if she makes conversation or physical comfort unavailable.   \n\n\n\" That\u2019s not the definition of stonewalling that I know. I\u2019m acting according to my feelings which are very disturbed. Yes, the timing is unfortunate. I think you should apply to the Job anyways. I emailed you the draft of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 from last night anyways. I\u2019m not into how we interacted last night. At all. \"  \n\n\nI've heard that INFJs can be linear in thinking and can have a tendancy to shut down - as this type of reaction is much more than how I would react, what I am asking for is a little clarity or reflection.   \n\n\nHow do you  INFJs deal with your ENTPs?"

                "body": "It's been maybe a month since I started spending significant amount of time studying poker theory and trying to apply them. What I find the most challenging is the fact that this game gives you no feedback in the short term, and so I have no way of evaluating my play & adjusting in real-time. I find myself making millions of decisions every second playing this game, and I have nowhere else but reddit to ask if my decisions are based on sound strategy or not. I'm going to share a hand below where I shoved AKs on turn against an opponent that has been playing just about any two cards (\\~80% range). I lost, and have analyzed it multiple times via Poker Tracker, and would like some feedback on that analysis & my line of thinking.\n\nI play 6 handed NL Hold'em cash games at micro-stakes (0.02/0.05) pretty much exclusively. These tables are mostly filled with calling stations (I regularly see players with VP$IP of over 70-80, with less than 30 PFR), with some rocks (as low as 4/4 VP/PFR), other TAGs and sometimes maniacs (80/80's) sprinkled in. (I understand that these stats aren't golden because I play on Ignition where all players are anonymous; however, I've also heard that VP$IP and PFR converge relatively quickly). So given that I am still very much playing poker on a theoretical basis more than actual experience, I am trying to find the right way to adjust to these player profiles and start crushing these micro-stakes games.\n\nI think I understand preflop action, as it's mostly mathematical and (in my opinion) pretty straightforward. I've been trying to practice my postflop, learning how to make thin value bets by trying to read my opponent's ranges and finding the right bluff-to-value ratio. I find that in general, I am getting better at making weak hands work by bluffing with the right board texture against certain ranges. I get read pretty quickly by the regulars and sometimes end up getting exploited by some LAG players who know what they are doing. (I once faced a player who literally played 90% of their starting hands, and folded < 20% of his hands, and reach showdown with at least 25-30% of those hands - and never lose showdown. Lucky AND good was my takeaway for the night).\n\nHowever, I have noticed that I don't quite know when to stop my aggression strategically. I feel like whenever I stop betting (I used to cbet 100% of the times, and I've been trying to adjust it down to more like 60%) I am telling everyone that I missed the flop, and after 50+ hands I notice people just start raising me left and right. I start bleeding chips, feel pressured, and start shoving more, even sometimes with just a top pair, because I realize that these players are very loose players who are playing even more loose by raising me so often. Yet, even though my play is still generally much tighter than my opponents, I seem to always lose the drawing game.\n\nBelow is a game I had with AKs against J9s on a KT4 rainbow. The villain was a loose calling station with high VP$IP, low PFR and AF/AFq on all streets.\n\n>**0.02/0.05 NL Hold'em (6 handed)**Preflop: Hero is BTN with Ac Kc (3 players)Hero open-raises with 3xBB, *SB folds*, BB calls.  \n>  \n>Flop: (9xBB) Kh Ts 4c (2 players)SB checks, BB bets 4xBB, Hero raises 12xBB. *SB folds*, BB calls.  \n>  \n>Turn: (33xBB) Qh (2 players)BB checks, Hero bets the pot, BB shoves, Hero calls and shoves. BB shows Jd 9d (Straight, king to nine).\n\nAfter replaying the hand multiple times and fiddling with FlopZilla a little bit, I think the main leak was underestimating the check-raise line on the turn with a possible nut straight on the board. However, the reason I shoved with just the top pair is because the villain was a very loose player who plays over 80% of his hands. (Also I felt pretty pot-committed because with my pot-sized bet, I was already investing in half of my stack).\n\nI wonder if the half-pot bet on the flop should've been a tell for some sort of a draw play. I'm blocking the K, and half-pot seems a lot for pairing with T or 4. When he called by raise on the flop, I thought he was just being the usual calling station that he is.\n\nI am struggling with this analysis though mainly because, based on what I can gather from FlopZilla, I was favored against his range (even if I were to be generous and give him about 20% range, my AKs still has 67% equity over his range on the turn) heavily in every street. It was literally either J9s or J9o that have good enough equity to go all-in here. Was I wrong to think that I had enough equity to call this \"bluff\"? (BTW, his stack was about three times mine, but he still shoved the whole stack regardless. Does that reveal any information as opposed to if he betted specifically my stack?)\n\nI wonder if the fact that A's are my outs which would also create a nut straight texture should have made me play more cautiously. What am I missing? Don't all-in on wet boards?"

                "body": "\\> How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n24 M. I've actually been obsessed with MBTI for several years by now. I am pretty certain of my type (which I won't reveal here), but I just wanted to see what other people might think based on my answers. Yes, I'm very bored.\n\nI'd like to think I'm pretty easy-going, but also sometimes I can appear apathetic. I usually get along with most people, but also I'm terrible at keeping lasting relationships because I just don't check in with people often enough. I'm the kind of person who's content with knowing that all my friends are healthy and alive, and don't give two shits about details of their lives. I'm good with strangers, small talk, and all that jazz - I enjoy being in foreign environments where that be from hanging out with an unfamiliar crowd, or traveling abroad solo. I get bored very easily, and I am always in search for something new. In fact, I was planning on leading a nomadic life style until the whole COVID shit hit.\n\nJust ask me in the comments if this isn't sufficient. I suck at describing myself lol\n\n\\> Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nNo. I'm kinda depressed but who isn't these days\n\n\\> Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI was born and raised in Asia, but my family migrated here when I was around 13. My parents are very gentle and somewhat timid; they are sort of like the stereotypical \"nice\" Asians who never speak up. I kinda take that after them and also avoid stirring up shit - like if I see hair in my food, I'd just take it out and keep eating most of the time. My family is also kind of lazy, in terms of just always being late to things and being homebodies. Because my family was never a fan of outdoor activities, I'm not used to going out to play ball or something with my friends either. As a kid I played a ton of PC games, and I still do to this day. After college though, I've become a lot more social and started going out more often than I sit home and play games (until COVID hit, that is).\n\n\\> What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI'm a consultant, so I fly M-TH, weekly. Or used to. I loved it - weekly change in scenery was great, and little perks like free travel to anywhere else in the world on weekends was fabulous. This is part of the reason why I stopped gaming between graduation and COVID - I was always out and about (which is very unlike how I was raised)\n\n\\> If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nIf I can't even text anyone and stuff, I'd get pretty lonely. I get my fix through multiplayer games though. I actually can't play single player games without getting bored within the first hour or less. If I'm completely disconnected from everyone for an entire weekend, I'd be pretty upset.\n\n\\> What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI don't really watch sports, and I'm also pretty bad at it (not athletic at all). Only \"sports\" I play is snowboarding if that counts, which I'm decent at. I suck at team games, so things like soccer, basket ball, etc. are out of the question for me. I also used to be obsessed with table tennis... I recently started learning tennis and long boarding. I'm looking forward to learning how to surf next year, but for now I need to figure out how to swim first lol (and I grew up near the beach... smh)\n\nI do watch esports though. Big fan of starcraft.\n\n\\> How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI have always been a curious person since when I was a very little kid. According to my mom, I'd just keep asking why until she just couldn't take it anymore (although I supposed a lot of kids are like that). I'm not sure if I have more ideas than I can execute because, while I do have trouble doing everything I'd like to do, it mostly stems from my laziness and my inability to follow through with plans unless there is a real consequence to it (and even then, I do everything last minute. It's almost irresistible - I just perform better under pressure lol). Speaking of which, I love being under pressure. Makes me feel alive.\n\nMy ideas are usually things I can make use of/make money off of. I have a ton of business ideas and shit going on in my head, but none of them are actually appealing enough for me to follow through. Well, except for a couple, but I'm just lazy & busy with my current job as well as video games. I have even less time these days because I'm trying to pick up new hobbies as well.\n\n\\> Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nNah. Leadership comes with too much responsibility. I'm not very ambitious - I like to just stay at where it's most comfortable - where I'm making just enough money to do the stuff I want to (e.g. traveling) without having to live paycheck to paycheck. When I am forced into a leadership position though, I do decently well depending on the circumstances. I'd say I show very inconsistent results mostly because 1. I fail to be a good role model and 2. I'm too nice and can't order people around. But if I'm in a team of capable people who already have an established mutual respect, then I can really drive things forward because I am the opposite of indecisive (except for when I'm at a restaurant unfortunately). But then again, anyone could be a good leader in those kind of teams.\n\nMy leadership style is mostly like, I respect you and trust you to do the right thing, so I'll just pilot a set of guidance that we can all discuss and agree on, set a deadline, and let's talk again on that deadline. \n\n\\> Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nEhh depends. Clumsy is not the first word people would use to describe me, but I'm not very coordinated either. I guess I do enjoy working with my hands in the sense that I can't leave it alone (e.g. in school I was that annoying kid who would always try to spin and drop his pen in class)... Also a major reason I like starcraft is because that game requires you to play very fast lol so in some ways I do enjoy working with my hands I supposed. I also used to be obsessed with origami.\n\n\\> Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nLOL no I'm so bad at art. And I can appreciate most, if not all, genres of music. Visual arts though, I have no clue. Especially modern arts. Beats me.\n\n\\> What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nPast memories creep up to me sometimes and hurt my self esteem. I only remember negative things from the past. But also I have a terrible memory - I may remember bits and pieces here and there, but I rarely spend time thinking about them.\n\nIn terms of future, well I have a tattoo that basically says #YOLO so I don't really think much about it. I like to wing things. \n\nSo I guess I mostly focus on the present. I tend to just brush of any premonitions with \"eh I'll deal with it when it's about to kill me\"\n\n\\> How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI am extremely willing to help my friends when they reach out! Sadly, that happens rarely. That said, I get quite easily annoyed if:\n\n\\- They are asking for something very simple - like, when doing it themselves would be faster than explaining to me what they need done\n\n\\- They have been asking for the same thing too often too quickly\n\n\\- They don't properly show appreciation of my time; taking things for granted is a big no no for me\n\nBut in general, helping is just fun!\n\n\\> Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes and people without logical consistency annoys the hell out of me. Like, I don't actually care what you believe in, but the stuff you believe in need to be consistent throughout.\n\n\\> How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nIt's good to have it. But they are not my priority. I'd sometimes take an inefficient route intentionally to learn more about something. And like I mentioned, I'm lazy as fuck so in terms of productivity... yeah\n\n\\> Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI think I tend to be a little manipulative (especially if I'm in a relationship). I've been more aware of this in the past couple years and have been trying to stop doing that. I just do it without thinking; if I'm angry, I get this strong urge to guilt trip the other party, and if I want to hear something specific from someone, I'd sort of manipulate the conversation and their responses until I hear what I want.\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nSnowboarding, driving (aggressively lol), video gaming, weed, music, etc. I like snowboarding because it's exhilarating and makes me feel like I'm one with the mountain. Same deal with driving. Video games have always been a part of my life, and I tend to enjoy fast paced, strategic, and tactical games (but not shooters because I can't fucking aim). Weed, it makes me stop thinking too much and just chill and enjoy the vibe. Music, well idk I just appreciate good music. Also used to do a lot of music up until college\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI learn best on my own, through reading mostly. I can't learn from videos because often times I have a very specific piece of information I'm after. Videos make it difficult for me to locate such information and scroll to that spot. Reading is also easier because I can consume the information at my own pace. It frustrates me when people try to explain something but they talk about shit I already know/that isn't terribly relevant to what I'm trying to learn. It doesn't always have to be concise and to the point, but I also don't have time to listen to a whole ass video.\n\nI hate school. I hate classes. I just wish the teacher would give me all the stuff I need to learn for the semester so I can go home and study them however I like. I had no problem with a class being graded entirely on just the midterm and final. Just don't taking attendance for fuck's sake\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nNo I just wing my life, I could be dead tomorrow for all I know.. also this questionnaire was a mistake, this shit is long\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nProfessionally I want to be able to make enough money to be able to do whatever the fuck I want without being financially constrained (that is not to say I want to be a millionaire, I want just enough money). Personally I just want to be able to whatever the fuck I want until I die\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nOmg I hate bugs. Anything with more than 4 legs. I shriek when I see a fly. Help. It's gross. :<\n\nAlso paranormal shit. I can't watch horror movies. And darkness. Sometimes I run to my bed after turning the lights off... Mind you, I'm 24\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nGood question... happens rarely but when it does, I am very productive, getting shit done, getting results, still not on time but I go to bed feeling accomplished. I feel like a better person, I feel more valuable, and I feel like I actually matter.And I feel optimistic about the future.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nI hate myself, I think that I am worthless. I get in this rut of nobody cares about me and if I died right here only a handful of people would care. I get extremely demotivated and don't get anything done. I go to bed thinking that I have so much shit to do yet I'll just take care of em the next morning.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI do daydream quite a bit, but not because I'm thinking but because I'm just zoning out. I pay attention to details when I do but usually I'm not really looking around unless I have a reason to. Usually if I'm out, I'm with friends, and I don't have a reason to look around. I do notice my surroundings when I'm alone. That's what I like to do when I chill alone.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI just wanna get out tf\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI take as much time as I'm given. If I have a lot of time, I'll constantly second guess myself until the d-day. If I have very little time, I'll just call it and see where it leads.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nOh I'm so bad with emotions. Sometimes I get a mini breakdown from emotion overload (and just cry to my SO. Sorry my ex's)\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nYeah I do it if I don't care about that person and I just want to keep the peace. I'm very good at pandering. If he's someone important to me though I'd probably argue/debate him until we reach a consensus.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI don't break rules because I want to; I just do what makes sense, and I just sometimes happen to break some rules. I don't think authority should be challenged; nor do I think they do know better. If they don't know better, they should be challenged; if they do, then they should be respected and listened to. It's all circumstantial and there is no one size fits all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan y'all type me??? This could be interesting. Please make my time worth it my fingers hurt rn ;c"

I've heard my parents complain to me about this one neighbor for a few years, but I never realized how bad it is until today.\n\nBasically they would host parties until very late at night (2-3 AM) multiple times a week. My mom (who's most affected by this) has knocked on their door several times, but it almost seems like the music is getting louder each time. Considering that it's been a problem since my family moved here 3 years ago, I think it's fair to say that we no longer have the obligation to avoid more confrontational approaches.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a fairly new neighborhood (my family was one of the first households to move in) and the HOA seems useless; no one is working at night, so they can't really shut down these parties. Even the police is unhelpful because they are closed after 11 PM. Even the ones that are supposedly open 24/7 rarely picks up the call.\n\nToday we called 877-ASK-LAPD and asked if they could dispatch an officer to shut the party down. 20 minutes later, an officer called us back, asking if there are any injuries involved. We obviously answered no. The police never came before the party was over.\n\nI'm looking for advice on where to proceed here. It's difficult to be patient with my neighbor because they do this multiple times throughout the week, even on weekdays sometimes. I have to wake up at 6 AM everyday because I work on Eastern time; this is becoming more than just a nuisance at this point.\n\nI plan to visit my local station with evidence of noise my parents have been collecting the past few years. Hopefully that will encourage the police to actually do something about this situation. To my knowledge my neighbor has never been fined or anything for their disturbances. \n\nI'm here to seek advice on how to best proceed because, after seeing how poorly they have been dealing with our noise complaints, I have very low hopes of getting any help from the police. Should I sue my neighbor? What do I need to do in order to do this, what are the risks, and how much would it all cost? I've never been involved in legal actions before, so I have no clue as to how they work.\n\nThanks in advance!"

A few specs here and there is average. I myself, applying everyday eyeshadow do not experience fallout. If I did it would just be a no from me because I don't expect fallout from 2 neutral coloured eyeshadows.\n\nNot pigmented means the colour doesn't show up very well, and buildable colours may very well not be that pigmented. But this can be a good thing. When we want pigment we're looking at bold colours, not transition colours (browns, beige, anything natural looking that is meant to be blended). Most eyeshadows are buildable. Even pigmented ones could benefit from adding another layer. But each formula is different and creates a different look. For example, my juvia's place palettes are very pigmented so I don't need to build them up when I'm creating a natural look. However with my urban decay palette, it's meant ONLY for natural looks hence all the eyeshadows are not pigmented but very smooth and buildable. Fool proof.  I like both of them. \n\nIn terms of how easily it comes off when you TRY to take it off, wouldn't worry about it. I'd worry more about if it separates into a mess when I'm not trying to take it off. I have oily eyelids so cheap shit like colourpop doesn't work.",

She would then say dad says that \"I don't do anything\"\nStuff like this made me hate him because he was invalidating as to how much she did. But then now I realised no matter what the argument was about she would first downgrade his work and say that my dad does nothing. This made me realise she thinks that the work she like chores and feeding us is the only actual work. If then he would play the same tactics on her she would then come to us for validation. \nI remember how much she argues with me and my bro whenever we say something to her that she finds offensive. \nIf that's how it works, then man my parents should be grateful to me that I'm going to school with a good attendance and not wasting their money \ud83e\udd21. \nIt doesn't just make fucking sense lmfao",

According to her word cry is only used when someone dies . And no matter what the context one is saying something, she always perceives it in a context totally different from the speakers and always feels the need to interfere between 2 people who are talking. \n\nOh and then comes a call from my mothers sisters , her mother and friends. (which is pike everyday,gossiping is something they can never resist) How does she suddenly become  so enlightened? Asks them not do this that and the negative impact it has on the child or how you shouldn't be toxic positive or anything and just enjoy what you are doing instead of living in fear.... \n\n\nEven though I witness this everyday it never ceases to surprise me. Does she actually know the impact of this because there are times I have called her o\nout and tried explaining it to her?  Does She understand what I mean but is not just ready to accept that she does this too? Or is this knowledge gained from how she had been treated as a child? This is the only thing that I can never wrap my head around, because I'm unable to figure out the reason behind such a reaction.",

So what imagine if a caretaker hired did that, wouldn't you want her to loose the job and ask your parents to tell how problematic she is. \nOne could definitely look in the perspective that they are your biological caretaker. Still a caretaker right? If you wouldn't allow the person who was hired to pull stunts like why her. Is it because she birthed you? That's such a bad excuse. People don't understand the fact that not all children love their parents and always assume it's the child that rebellious and full of themselves. This is assumed especially by those who have gone through all this but are In constant denial (because for them, it has shaped them to be good and respectable person)\n\nAnd then there are some who do not understand the gravity of the situation. They don't understand that constantly experiencing even the same one time trivial incident is problematic too. Imagine being lied on face everyday and you sometimes have to think twice before calling them out because you know what you are getting yourself into. \n\nAnd the fact that you don't love your mother is absolutely normal. And ofc you will meet more people in the near future who would be flabbergasted at the fact that you don't love someone who kept you in their body for 9th months. All you can do is just ignore them, and tell them that you are not obliged to explain why you hate them especially if they seem the kind to not be able to understand",

                "body": "I have come to realize over the years that a significant factor that always holds me back from being happy, keeps me depressed, and also badly impacts my relationships (both with friends and romantically) is my inherent distrust in human beings. I don't want to feel this way, I just do, and it dictates a significant amount of my thought processes, the way I react to things, and the way I respond to others. I think about the way that I think and I have no idea how to fix it. It is like this outlook is hardwired in my brain and I would have to gut the whole thing to take it out. I have seen many therapists throughout my life, and will start seeing another one hopefully soon (they have to get back to me on when), but none of them have helped with this issue.\n\nI think one of the earliest things that fed this mindset was an event that took place when I was about 6 or 7. I was in the backseat of my mom's car and she was taking me to school, when someone in front of us (about two cars up) hit a dog. Now, there was heavy traffic since it was right in front of my elementary school, and cars were pretty much bumper to bumper, so in my mind as a child, I came to the conclusion that these people hit the dog on purpose. We had to pass by the dog, and I still have the image burned into my mind of him suffering, and it brings me to tears even just to type it out. I remember declaring that day that I absolutely hated all people, and this is when I was six years old. When I told my teacher about it in tears, she seemed indifferent and didn't really care, even though she said that she saw it too. This further solidified in my mind that the world is full of heartless monsters. I don't know if they hit him on purpose, but it really seemed that way back then, and I still have never forgotten to this day at 21 years old. Over the years I continued to see the evil side of humanity by the way people treated me in school, in friendships, relationships, etc, and every time I see someone hurting animals this feeling arises and my cynicism is reinforced.  I feel like no one understands me. I am so cynical, but I know that it just hurts me, and it is a terrible, sad way to live.\n\nHas anyone else have similar feelings of cynicism, or were able to overcome their cynicism? If so, what did/ do you do to cope and how have you gotten better?"

                "created_utc": 1614396087.0,
                "body": "So I am here looking for advice. Like the title said I am thinking about dropping out of my physics with calc class and taking it either in the fall or next spring, since I need physics 1 and 2 with calc for my Computer science degree. The reason for this is because I am struggling so much with the physics itself, partially because of my memory and attention problems (I have ADHD, and I have a very hard time with my working memory), and also because I am so overloaded with work from my other classes, mostly calculus 2. The amount work being assigned from my calc 2 class is just so much, that I barely have enough time to go over my physics textbook slowly and carefully, and carefully going over the examples, since I learn things much slower and need to know how the concepts work, and why in order to commit them to memory. \n\nAnother big problem I am having is with the language of the physics problems. I don't know if this is a common problem, because I have looked all over the internet for this and could not find anything, but a lot of the times I will read a problem and either miss a point they are making entirely (this is mostly caused by me not remembering or carefully learning all the intricate little details of the concepts behind the problem), or just not know what the question is asking. An example would be a problem I got yesterday: it was about a car going around a banked curve at the minimum speed required to not slide down the bank. I was stuck on this problem for HOURS and had to ask for help twice. In the end my professor told me (over email, because it is a zoom class... which is also hard because I think I really need face to face help especially with physics) that the friction force does not go down the curve like in a problem where the car is going max speed, but it is going up the curve since the car is going slower and tending to slide down. I would never have guessed this. Like I do not know if I am just very tired from staying up until very late every night doing homework or too stressed out but it is just so hard for me to understand what the questions are implying. I am used to math classes where I am given an equation and told to solve it, but in physics I have to figure out what equations they are telling me to use, and on top of that understand the phenomena being described in the question so I can use the correct values. I think I could do this if I could dedicate most of my time to this class, but unfortunately that is just not the case due to my overbearing calc 2 class. \n\nSo what would be some advice to improve, and maybe do my homework and learn the concepts faster? Because I'm really thinking about dropping this class and taking it after I am done with calc 2 so I do not fail both, because another thing is I had a physics test and a calc 2 test on the same day and I failed both miserably with below 50%. I would rather have to retake just one class instead of both. \n\nTl;dr thinking about dropping physics because I don't understand what the questions are asking me and I have too much homework from another class, thus don't have enough time to carefully learn the material. My ADHD makes this even more difficult."

                "body": "I am in college majoring in Computer Science, and taking calculus 2 this semester.  I feel like I either take way too long to do my homework, or I am getting way too much. I get one calc 2 assignment due each tuesday of every week, and  will take me probably 15-20 hours to complete. One assignment usually has 30-40 questions, and each question takes me quite a while to complete, but this is dependent on the problem. An example would be this weeks homework: we are doing trigonometric integration and substitution. The assignment is 31 questions long and I have done 15 of them so far, but it took me  about 10  hours to do, and this is actually quick for me. The assignments I had for finding the volume of solids created by rotating the curve around a line or axis using shells, disc or washers took MUCH longer. Same thing with the surface area problems. It's not that I don't understand the questions, it just takes me SO long to do them all! Especially since I have ADHD, but the thing is I take medication so I'm able to stay focused usually, but I always make little mistakes here and there that costs me A LOT of time, since I always have to retrace my steps and look back for my mistake, which usually ranges from forgetting to write down a negative sign to writing down a completely different number for no reason (like today, I wrote down pi/3 instead of pi/2 for an upper bound for my def integral, and this kind of thing happens consistently). \n\nI guess just all in all, what is some advice for this problem? What can I do differently to do my calc homework faster so my whole life is not completely and utterly consumed by homework? Because I have other classes too and I pretty much do homework all day from the time I wake up until I go to sleep at around 2AM and I am still struggling. I cannot do anything that I love or enjoy anymore.\n\nTl;dr I take 15-20 hours every week to do my calculus 2 homework. I understand the material I just cannot work quickly for some reason and each problem takes a very long time. What is some advice you would have for me?"

Two of the classes I am taking are calculus 2 and calculus based physics 1, and when it comes to solving the problems on the homework for these classes, every tiny detail must be accounted for, or the final answer will be incorrect. I have been struggling with this because I always miss about one or two small details for nearly every time I try to solve a problem, and it sometimes takes me over an hour to solve ONE problem. \n\nSome examples would be just now I took over an hour to complete one question for physics because I kept messing up the decimal places in the numbers of the original equation that was given! (I used 2.80 and .0280 before I finally looked at it good and saw it was .280) And in my calculus I will consistently miss where to change signs from positive to negative and vice versa, making me take 3x longer on a question than I should take. So completing my assignments takes VERY LONG because of these things, and my life has become completely consumed by my homework because it takes me 20 hours to complete an assignment that should take only 5. \n\nI take ADHD medication, so the problem now isnt focusing, I can mostly focus now but I still make these mistakes constantly... Would anyone have any advice for me? Maybe someone who also has ADHD and has/is currently majoring in STEM?"

Everybody's talking about grades ALL. THE. TIME. Having a bad grade is a weakness and when someone gets a bad grade, they keep it a secret just because they don't want to seem weak. I've been a successful student all my life but that changed since I started this school. I've been diagnosed with depression in my sophomore year, and I'm a junior now. I just can't perform my best in academics because of this and this environment really makes things worse. I have far lower grades compared to my friends. When they ask me my grades, I avoid telling them because I'm ashamed. They don't understand how it feels like to push yourself everyday just to get out of bed. I feel miserable. They complain about a single point that they couldn't get in a test, while I'm literally trying to not fail my classes. I'm just so tired."

I overcame a fear that I had after the terrorist attacks in France (where I lived) in 2015 and learned that compromise is important to cooperation. \n- How I learned to follow my own path for my future career by declaring my independence from my dad, who was forcing his dreams on me by wanting me to go to naval academy, where he graduated from. This could be more personal b/c I rarely got to see him and therefore was willing to do a lot for him to be proud of me, but I learned that I had to do follow my own aspirations. \n\nWhich one sounds better? I\u2019m conflicted over this. Thank you!"

Your decison isn't acknowledged in the game.\n\nThat's why I gave Dishonored as an example. \n\nIf You play aggressively and most would agree therefore more satisfyingly, not only You get more Guards/Infected/Traps/Rats in your next level, but the entire public opinion on Your character changes in game too. Posters of Your face begin to appear warning citizens to watch out for themeselves. \nNPCs get frightened dialogs about You. \nThey act scared of You.\nAnd for good reason. \n\nReally, when You play bloodthirsty in Dishonored, You actually make the city go to ruin, as there is ongoing plague, and because You leave so much dead bodies it spreads even more easly, so much so many people die because of You ecen if You didn't kill the Yourself. \nSo yep. \n\nThere are real consequences not only for gamplay but overall ingame-wise also. \n\nThat's why there You actually can be held accountable for being bloodthirsty bastard and destroying the ingame-kingdom and its people.\n\nEven if it feel so good and satisfying going around and just killing Your enemies with goodly animated finishers and fight moves. \n\nOn the other hand\n\nHere in Part2 You just decide between:\n\n1.Make use of this perfectly and realistically, gory animations of killing but make Your game harder, yet still manageble to beat.(As long as You don't play on Grounded)\n\nAnd for once don't feel the disonance between Your actions and what the game makes You out to be.\n\n\nOr.\n\n2. Playing stealthy and safely, with nothing too much satisfying and making the game easier, but the game in-story still treats You as if You are a bloody murderer.\n\nBut, I guess what I'm trying to say is, if You like to make a reward of something that\n\n!For me peraonally!(I can't stress that enough) \n\nshouldn't really be considered a reward, aka the difficulty change,\n\nThen I have really no right to tell You that it isn't a better outcome already, but still\n\nIt most certainly isn't one for me",

And that behaviour makes You ignorant and stupified\n\nAnd that's what comes from keeping Yourself in censory snowflake-y bubble. \n\n\nAnd so again, I cannot think how anyone would prefer it over just plain trying to understand that opinions in their nature are supposed to gain reactions as they're all equal to share.\n\nAnd as they're equal\nYou also get what You give.\nHence voting as best feedback system for your 'takes'.\n\n(And so then You get the option to agree to disagree with others and go home. \nIt's the best option most of the time)\n\nYou can also ignore others' opinion, but You should never treat it as if it didn't exist in the first place and those systems help with that.\n\nBut that's just *my opinion* on the matter ;)\n\n\nEDIT: Again formating. I'm both glad that I'm not the only one who always have to edit just for that and I feel for You. It's always annoying.\n\nAnyway, as a digression, I'm happy for Yours and Your friend's understanding.\n\nI have the exact same situation with my own friend also leaning left while I just want to take best from every side.\nBut the action of agree to disagree just makes wonders for our relationship",

I would even say, they don't really care about the change of paceing in the \"second\" half of the movie, which makes the ending half feel kinda rushed.\n\nIt feels like the movie had great concepts but it only scratched upon them.\n\nBut because people finally got what they wanted, they tend to overlook it. It feels just right for them.\nBecause on the surface level 3.0+1.0 makes just enough sense, has just good enough plot-\n\nSo why should those people greatly content with the happy ending and all the other things they like in this movie,\nlook for flaws, when at first glance nothing is wrong with it?\n\nIt is good enough to them.\nThey don't want to,\nAnd\nI want to stress that out  .*don't need to*.  look for flaws on the deeper level, because there is no point for them doing it.\n\n3.0+1.0 is good enough movie. \nViewers get what they wanted, get to feel good for once, Anno gets to once again close a chapter of his life\n(Final this time?)\n\n.Everyone's happy.\nSo what's not to like here, yeah?\n...\n\nWell, I understand everyone who feels that way.\nAnd I can respect it.\nYou got what You've wanted.\nEven if execution was lacking,\nEven if it could have felt shallow compared to the OG and EoE ending.\n\nAnd I'm happy for everyone who finally got closure thanks to \n3.0+1.0\n\nIt's just..\nFor me personally, and quite some other fans it seems, even if \n\"the movie is good enough\"\n\nIt is just not \"good enough Evangelion\"\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have nothing against Happy Ending for Evangelion\nYes, I would prefer it bitter-sweet, but that doesn't change the fact that I would be very content with Happy one too-\n\nBut the Happy Ending we got just doesn't do for me.\n\nOr, maby I should say isn't convincing enough, for me to overlook many, many, many flaws in general structure, plot, and essence of the film.\nAgain, for me, It just feels shallow.\n\nAll the films wanted to put too much content in, and because of that too many things are just under developed.\nJust scratched upon.\nEspecially the characters.\nThe Happy Ending in form we got is rushed and unearned in context to Evangelion series as a whole.\n\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n3.0+1.0 is a good movie.\n\nOn the surface level it gives exactly what You would want from the final film.\nIf You look just at the movies it can pass as a good closure.\n\nYou can be happy, because the characters finnally don't end up with depression/turn into orange juice/world isn't apocalyptic.\n\nYou feel good about watching it, it cheers You up.\nIt gives You all the good feelings.\n\nAnd that's great.\n\nBecause, 3.0+1.0 is a good film/\nIt is a good ennding for Rebuild Movie.\n\nIt's just..\nFor Many fans\nIt is (not) good enough for Evangelion Final (Happy) Ending.",

I'm a girl with very long hair so I went for a no shave option and they used 3 relatively thin, but wide strips along the back of my crown area for my donor hairs. They bandaged each strip with some antibiotic ointment post op, and it felt fine enough to sleep for the first night or two. About 2 days later and I'd unbandaged and washed only the back of my head as per my doctors instructions, with everything looking fine and healing well. My issue is that shortly after I removed those bandages, the areas began throbbing like absolute hell, which has made it near impossible to sleep for a couple nights now. My surgeon prescribed me oxycodone incase of pain following my procedure, but even that only knocks me out for maybe 2 hours at best before I'm woken up by my aching head. Now, I usually have a pretty high pain tolerance, and while sitting upright I'd say it's a very manageable pain, maybe a 2 or a 3/10, but laying down to sleep (even with a neck pillow) or applying any pressure to the areas has got to be at least like an 8/10 pain. I'm not comfortable enough to begin sleeping on my side again because I fear it is still to early and I might disrupt my frontal grafts. Does anyone have any advice or local medications I can use for this?"

Doing whatever he says out of fear.

But sometimes it\u2019s not.\nWhat happens when it\u2019s not, and you can\u2019t escape without being guilted/feared into not killing yourself? Being alive as a human being on Earth is fucked up. Of course people are depressed and suicidal. It\u2019s fucking brutal, twisted, and cruel here. I refuse to radically accept something that isn\u2019t good for me. I refuse to radically accept \u201cthe way things are.\u201d Because the way things are is BULLSHIT. How we human in society is bullshit. I refuse to radically accept that everyone is believing their \u201creality\u201d while I\u2019m stuck here, seemingly alone, laughing and crying (mostly crying) at the dumpster fire hell that is existence on Earth as a human being. But I guess here I am believing it\u2019s a dumpster fire hell. \n\nI didn\u2019t used to.\nAnd I\u2019m really fucking heartbroken. Not just because I miss how I used to see things and people\u2026but because both this perspective and the one I used to have are valid. Both are true. Yet the magic doesn\u2019t outweigh the tragedy\u2026\n\nI have no choice but to keep going. Because whether I like it or not, I exist. The people I love who love me exist. And I don\u2019t want to abandon them.\n\nAnd who knows\u2026maybe in 5-10 years I\u2019ll feel way differently.\nBut that\u2019s part of why I don\u2019t want to be human. It seems like we are the most inconsistent, suggestible species. We are not that intelligent, despite what \u201cthe great minds\u201d lead us to think. None of our minds are great. I think we are still basically \u201ccavepeople\u201d, we just have different infrastructure, language, and culture. \n\nAlright that\u2019s enough. \nCan anyone relate?\ud83d\ude29"

(Obv a lion kills the Hunter early)\n\nSmall arena?\n\n4 Lions, 50 hawks. I ride one lion around the arena. This instantly eliminates my issue of the rats. I immediately send, say, 6 hawks to get the Hunter since he's simply the biggest threat. He picks off 1 hawk, reducing me to 49. The other 5 scratch and maul him. I take his rifle. While this is happening, I send off two of my lions to kill the Buffalo, one by one. Then, I pick off the wolves with my new rifle. The hawks swarm the gorillas, since they're fast enough that the gorillas probably couldn't do anything. They'd last a while, but eventually the hawks would whittle them down and they'd die. I'd lose a solid 8 hawks during this - 1-2 per gorilla - but overall, that's worth it. Finally, as a force, we collectively deal with the alligators. We avoid the water, so they have to come to us. The lions pick them off one by one while the hawks swarm them, keeping them off the lions while they do their work. I' going to be generous here and say that they bump us down to around 25 hawks.\n\nThis is where my problem arises.\n\n3 brown bears is a big deal.\n\nGrizzly attacks are usually non-fatal, however, this is because they are in self defense.\n\nA grizzly dead set on killing you is HIGHLY dangerous.\n\nPart of the reason why a polar bear is so much more dangerous than a grizzly is the fact that polar bears see you as food. Not as a threat.\n\nA grizzly with this mentality would be less dangerous than a polar bear, but still HIGHLY dangerous. More dangerous than a normal brown bear.\n\nThis is 4 lions and a rifle vs 3 grizzlies.\n\nI don't know who would win that. In a 1v1, the grizzly wins in my opinion. However, this is a 1v1 with a rifle, hawk, and an additional lion as backup.\n\nIm not sure how this goes. I feel like the hawks help my odds a lot, but I'm still not entirely sure.",

                "body": "Disclaimer; My knowledge of Greek Mythology is limited, and Google helped me a lot here. If something is wrong, I'm sorry. Let me know and I'll change it.\n\nNea - Nemesis; The goddess of retribution against hubris. This is also referred to as rhamnusia, hence the name of Nea's outfit.\n\nAce - Dionysus; The god of fruitfulness, vegetation, and of course, wine. \n\nFeng - Athena; The goddess of wisdom and war. \n\n\nDavid - Heracles; A legendary Greek hero, known for his many trials and tribulations throughout his life. The description for David's outfit refers to it as being Herculean, even the Hercules is actually the Roman counterpart to the Greek Heracles.\n\nKate - My first assumption is one of the nine muses, who are patrons of various forms of spoken or sang art and lyricism, such as music, song, and poetry. Unfortunately I'm not entirely sure which, as what each of them represents is debated.\n\nAdam - Hermes; The messenger god. \n\nJeff - Prometheus; the Titan of fire. Prometheus stole fire from the gods, and gave it to humanity. For this, Zeus punished him by chaining him to a rock, and having his liver eaten or torn out by an eagle every day.\n\nJane - Like Kate, this seems to be a reference to the Muses. The description mentions the muse Thalia, so most likely her.\n\nYui - Nike; the Goddess of victory.\n\nZarina - Hera; the Queen of the Gods.\n\n\u00c9lodie - My initial thought was Pandora, but because it doesn't mention Elodie's outfit being a reference to a goddess, I think it could also be a reference to the expression \"be wary of Greeks bearing gifts\", which is a reference itself to the Trojan horse. Let me know if anyone has any better ideas.\n\nNurse - Most likely Arachne, a prideful weaver woman who was turned into a spider by Athena, and now seeks revenge for it. If you think it's someone else, let me know who.\n\nClown - Hades; the God of the Underworld\n\nSpirit - Nyx, the Goddess of the Night.\n\nOni - The Minotaur, a repulsive monster, which was the offspring of Pasiphae and a bull sent to King Minos of Crete by Poseidon.\n\nBlight - Charon, the son of Eremus and Nyx. His job is to ferry the newly dead over the River Styx.\n\nArtist - A Fury, or Erinye, were the chthonic dieties of vengeance, and resembled a mixture of a woman and a bird.\n\nWe still have yet to get a Poseidon, Zeus, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, or Demeter skins. If you were to give any of these to a character, who would you pick and why?\n\nFor me, it's Jake and Claudette as Poseidon and Demeter respectively. Claudette as Demeter because Demeter is the goddess of nature and Claudette is a botanist, and Jake as Poseidon because Poseidon wouldn't be good for any other survivor, and Jake wouldn't be good for any other major god."

I've only read the first one (plus a couple chapters of the second), and most people - even fans of the series - haven't read any of them.

I feel so detached from everything, hours can pass but my brain is so empty I don't even realize it's been forty minutes of absolutely nothing until I get up and can't even remember what happened the entire time. Except for that's my entire life now, everything that happens to me. I quite literally trudge through the day. I feel so lost.\n\nI used to be so happy and full of life, I could sit by myself for hours and just talk to myself, I was like my own best friend. I had thoughts all day everyday, my brain was so alive, it was like a whole other person, but yet I knew it was myself. I don't know how to explain it. Even when I was so upset, I could just talk to myself and feel better. Now I try to talk to myself and I can't. My brain is blank. I physically can't think before I speak. I felt like my own person, like I understood myself, like I could see deeper things than what was there, and it made me happy. I used to be thinking about what I was saying, something funny I had seen earlier, how the other person was reacting to what I was saying, what I was going to eat later, the dumb thing I did when I was nine, my favorite song, and a billion other things all at the same time.\n\nThe voice inside my head got me through so much, it got me through the toughest times of my entire life. I always felt deep down that I meant something, that I was real, because of my soul, or whatever it was. Now I feel nothing. I don't have depression or anything, it's not a lack of will to do anything - I can really do anything because I have no opinions about it - it's just a lack of feeling and thought to go with it. I'm just a body with nothing inside of it, experiencing day to day life but having no sense of self, no individuality, nothing. I am nothing.\n\nAnd it terrifies me. I can't do this much, longer, I'm breaking down. Even the most drab of things used to be beautiful in my mind, I had such a great sense of the world around me, I could have been a failure at life, had nothing to do all day, but I would be completely happy because I just had my little voice person I could talk to forever. I thought of myself as a separate entity, I thought of everyone as their own person and could differentiate them. Now they all blend together to me. I used to be a person with thoughts and feelings and opinions. It's like a switch just flipped from December 2021 (the best year of my life) and January 2022 (the worst year of my life).\n\nAnd nothing even happened, no event, no trauma, nothing, I just disappeared. And it's been so long, I'm terrified I'll never get me back. I'm even more terrified that maybe this is just how everyone else is, too. Maybe I just had something wrong with me at first, and now I'm the way I'm meant to be. I don't know if other people are like how I used to be or if this is normal, but after how I was, I can't do this forever. I can't. I need it to be over, I need to have thoughts and be a person again. I was so filled with personality, now I'm a blank slate. Has it been too long? Is this normal? Will it be this way forever? Death by a thousand knives is better than this, knowing that I lost everything I ever had within myself, and it could be gone forever, the world could be grey forever.\n\nI don't know what caused it so I don't know how to fix it, I don't know how to describe it or explain it properly so I can never get techincal, and I can't do this much longer. I can't. I have nothing and it kills me. Please, please, please help me. I'm so freaking scared. I want normality again, at least how it used to be, bliss in a way. I am a teenager, maybe it's a puberty thing, maturity, but then why would I have started with it just for it to disappear overnight, especially since I had started puberty years before this happened? Or is that what peaking is, did I peak before the age of 15?\n\nWill everything be okay?\n\nI desperately need help."

It's cakes, sugars, pizzas, meat (and I'm vegetarian), just all kinds of crackers and snacks. My family isn't well off at all so all the money I make at my part-time job (I'm in high school) goes straight to our bills, I can't buy my own food. My parents buy us fast food every day. I watch TV shows where kids beg their parents for McDonald's and are so overjoyed when their parents buy it for them and I can't believe that's relatable for most kids. \n\nEveryone in my family is overweight except me.. because of my eating disorder. \n\nBut it wasn't always like that, because up until I was about 11, I was overweight, too. Then I learned more about health and begged my parents to buy healthy food or make actual meals for us instead of just telling us to make microwave pancakes for dinner, or at least regulate what we eat and when, put a limit, anything, but they refused. I decided that I'd rather not eat anything than eat junk. \n\nAs I got older and began to care about my looks more, the reasoning behind my starving turned more onto trying to avoid looking how the rest of my family looks - I do want to be thin. But it's been five or six years of this and I'm out of energy and I've lost my period and I have panic attacks and meltdowns over Cheez-Its and no one knows. I haven't told anyone. \n\nBut I don't want this anymore. I want to be able to eat, because I don't want to die. \n\nBut I don't want to eat unhealthily either, because again, I don't want to die. \n\nIf I ever told my parents, they would just see it as \"oh, she needs to eat more\" and force me to eat their unhealthy snacks. I want to be healthy. I want to live normally. But no one can help me. I'm trapped between death or death and for the next two years, I have no way out. Please help me."

I don\u2019t feel blissful joy anymore. I can\u2019t have silly conversations with myself in my head. Colors aren\u2019t beautiful and smells aren\u2019t exciting. I think about things too deeply, consider everything carefully, exhausting and boring myself. The way I feel about other people has changed too.\n\nI used to see everyone as an individual, unique and fascinating and lovely, fun and sweet and I could understand the concept that other people are other people. Now, I don\u2019t know how to explain it right, but everyone seems empty. I feel like everyone is blended together, we\u2019re all the same, nothing separates us, everyone else feels exactly the same I do, no one is capable of feeling how I used to, everyone is *boring*.\n\nI started feeling this way quickly and suddenly - sometime between November of seventh grade and March, this entire change happened. In October I was still a bubbly kid, and by March I was a miserable clone. This was also around the time I got social media like Tiktok and Snapchat, though I\u2019ve since deleted them, which admittedly had helped, but it still scares me that maybe after having downloaded these apps once, I will never be happy again.\n\nI always hear \u201cit gets better\u201d and \u201cyou will be happy again\u201d, but I can\u2019t help but feel that maybe my miserable state now is everyone else\u2019s version of happiness. Was everyone else born this way and I was just lucky ? And now I\u2019m wasted ? I just feel like Im stuck in this painful and repetitive cycle forever. I don\u2019t want to live like this. I want to live like old me again. I want happiness again. I do still feel happiness sometimes, but it\u2019s nothing like the bliss that it was before. I want that back.\n\nIs this a normal teenage hormonal phase or am I stuck like this forever ? When will it be okay again ? I\u2019m starting to lose hope.. it\u2019s been almost three years since I\u2019ve felt like that and I\u2019m absolutely terrified. Please help me. Thank you:)"

It's like my mind was saying it's time, time to begin socializing with others instead of being stuck alone for the rest of my life.\n\n**A mid-size intro about myself**\n\nBasically, a very lonely boy who acts and looks like a emo-nerd (pls don't be repelled by that). Been seeking for interactions with anyone not from the family since last month.\n\nThe story about me is rather complicated and long but TL;DR..., everyone in school bullied me, yes everyone. I was too naive to understand, got depression once no longer naive, multiple near-suicide attempts, decided that \"living\" my life like this was no longer worth it, and finally went through an identity change last year to prevent them from defaming me. Basically, I never had a friend ever. I even had to go through an identity change just to prevent them from attempting to find me and ruin me.\n\nThe identity change helped me through a lot - it clears a lot of my former wrath and hatred, slowly healing and molding me into a different, but much better version of me. The one most important thing I haven't done with it though is actually interacting with others. The last time I interacted with someone else non-family was my psychologist that helped me through the identity change and that was a year ago. I guess this is why I am here...\n\n**Topics/Interests to talk about**\n\nLots of things we could try to discuss, since my interest is currently shifting around. There are some that are already firm in place such as video games, aviation, and philosophy. There are few things that I would prefer to not talk about which includes school stuff and masculinity.\n\n**Message/Voice chat?**\n\nI prefer texts rather than voice chats because either my anxiety will fire in great force or that I fear my voice may be too obnoxious and I can't even help it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoping someone see this and PM me..., that is if you want to of course..."

                "body": "So, I did around a dozen of tests to see which type I belong. The 4 letter typing results always say I am INTJ and their description seem fitting, so I thought I am an INTJ. But once I browsed Reddit about MBTI, many users say functions are more accurate and researching it myself is far better than the tests. So I looked at the functions, but it made me second-guessing whether I am INTJ because I may not be really understanding of their definitions, so I do the function tests as well. Almost all of the function tests I done, which is around half a dozen, seems to give an array of results, which are ENTJ, INTP, ESTJ, ISTJ, INTJ. I browsed some stuff to see which I can really relate but I have problems at that part sometimes. Well, I still have my own uncertainties and there is the possibility that I am wrong the whole time, so any help is really appreciated.\n\n**1.Age, gender, general description**\n\n20 years 3 months, Male, and just really a person that needs to get over things.\n\n**2.Medical diagnosis**\n\nI am diagnosed with Asperger's. The doctor said a lot of my temperament such as no touching and impaired social skills is a symptom of it. My parents confirmed it after I found out about it as my mother refuses to tell me. He said it is just mild because I could easily overcome them.\n\n**3.Upbringing, religious structure**\n\nMy parents were more traditional than religious, and they are very traditional. But they did not teach a lot of it because it didn't have a big impact on my academics. I didn't care much about them myself. That changed 6 years ago, when my mother found out about classes from her friend that supposedly could help her cope with her hardships. These classes teach a mixture of Confucianism and Buddhism. She made it a must for the family to attend the classes every Sunday since then. When I first heard about the necessity to attend these classes, I was very against it due to taking up my personal time and my strong believes in science and logic. Eventually, when I got depression 4 years ago, my mother said it was even more necessary as the classes actually helped her. The classes made the family even more religious and traditional than before to a point where tradition and religion are intertwined. During my depressive stage, I realized a lot things, and decided to follow, only because for cultural heritage and the potential to fix my life. Once i was out of my depressive stage, which is just 4 months ago, I have gone against it once again, but it is now because my personal philosophies clash really hard with the ideas of the religion. I personally believe my mother and 12 y/o brother is becoming vegan because of these teachings.\n\n**4.Job/Career**\n\nJobless. Looking for something to freelance, particularly coding or entertainment, since I couldn't let myself work under someone. In fact, all this was planned since 5 years ago, which means no matter I like it or not, I had chosen it for the plan and there is no backing off.\n\n**5.Weekend by myself, refreshed or lonely?**\n\nBoth actually. My distrust on others from disturbing me always make me glad there is the time for myself, the biggest part being there is always never enough alone time. However, I never had a friend at all, and the thought of being alienated make me feel lonely. I cope the loneliness by having an imaginary friend for myself (yes, I had to go that far), but I would made it very obscure.\n\n**6.Movement and surroundings. Outdoor activities or not.**\n\nI sometimes tend to be clumsy or my body has the tendency to fall over. If no one is watching, I mimic movements from game characters. My awareness of surroundings seem to differ on the circumstances. If it's something normal, I seem to start to not care and space out. If it's something private, I heightened awareness so that I ensure no one is watching me. I am not the type that do outdoor activities, might be due to my addiction towards video games.\n\n**7.Curiosity and ideas**\n\nI am really curious about basically anything. The biggest ones would be the motives, psychology of anyone for the behavior and actions they committed and the functions of the universe (or multiverse). My ideas are mostly sporadic, but they tend to have big implications if it happened. I see those ideas capable to be worked out, provided I have the resources and knowledge to do so. These ideas are mostly about the grand workings of everything.\n\n**8.Leadership and style. Good at it or not.**\n\nI generally wait for someone to assume the role of leadership and I would only take it if no one wants it, provided it involve an area of subject that I am confident that I know a lot about. I would refuse if it involves something I don't know about. There is the urge to take it sometimes though. If I lead, I would typically instantly gather on what to do, plan and assign tasks and set deadlines, right on the spot. Can't say good or not because I never had experience, though I believe it's not good because of others constantly disagreeing with me.\n\n**9.Coordinated? Working with hands?**\n\nIf by tasks and schedules, I am quite coordinated. I thought of what to do in what steps and ensure it must be done by following the same steps. I heavily dislike uncoordinated work. By body movements however is another thing. Sometimes my body just react that way because it does and I don't like it. By working with hands, I have no opinion on it.\n\n**10.Artistic? Appreciate art?**\n\nIf I am good at art, the job/career question would have a different answer already. Art is consistently my worst subject in school. It was so consistently bad, that I constantly lose interest in it. Doesn't help that my father, who occasionally do graphic arts for fun pressure me for this and comparing me to my sister who is consistently among the best in her class. 5 years ago however, I had renewed interest, after discovering artworks from various fandoms, including animations and music. This gave me an idea on using these aspects on my daydream stories that are constantly stuck in my head and being refined since I was 8. I attempted to do art again to hope it works out, while slightly better than it used to be, it's still very ugly. As such I ditched the attempt of doing art. However, as my sister, who is currently going to study an art diploma, said writing and music is also art. As such, I perhaps seek to convert my daydream stories into such, since I also got an encouragement from my cousin in pursuing writing just a month ago. However, according to my plans, they cannot be the first thing I do.\n\n**11.Past, present, future**\n\nThis is a very personal one, but I guess I must share to get over it or something.\n\nThe past is pretty much like hell for me. I never had any friends at all because of social rejection, bullying and betrayal. All it takes is just one small action on either me or someone else to cause such a domino effect. Back then, I was very naive, only understanding morals taught on textbooks and following it blindly, and expecting others to do the same. When they reject and bully me, I never understood why. Since, I was constantly \"tortured\" in this state, I seek to find out why are they doing this to me, while simultaneously becoming more isolated. And then 4 years ago, I seemed to finally \"figured\" it out. That realization is what sent me into depression. In my depressive state, I turned extremely emo, suicidal and paranoid, and possibly a misanthrope. The only thing I had in my mind is end all of humanity as punishment for going against me. My behavior significantly worsened, to a point where even my mother called me a demon (yes, this actually happened). It was only later in that stage I realized how terrible I am and how damaging it is to my plans. Upon reflection, I sworn to myself that I should change myself, my name and erase the past to ensure I have no correlation to that past and the past couldn't do any damage to my plans.\n\nI couldn't think much of the present. I only see it as do this do that for my plans and it's really boring.\n\nMost of the actions and plans are for the future actually. My own daydream stories are what I seek to relive in the future or what I envision the future will be. I would say it's the most exciting thing to think about. My plans revolve around it and I will ensure that no matter what, it has to go through, for everyone's sake.\n\n**12.Behavior/Actions when being asked for help**\n\nFirst of all, I have to make sure that you are specifically asking me for help, otherwise I wouldn't notice. I am more of the type that believes each and everyone must know how to fend for themselves. If I am being asked for help, I must know what you need, is your needs legal and do I have the capabilities to help. All of these conditions must be true in order for me to help you. I will try my best to help, though don't expect it to be nice.\n\n**13.Need logical consistency?**\n\nAbsolutely. Things have a way of working as it is and don't you go betraying it. The inconsistencies that are thrown to me seem to trigger me a lot.\n\n**14.Importance of efficiency and productivity**\n\nIt is of absolute importance that efficiency and productivity is highly prioritized. Nothing is getting done if any of these aspects are compromised.\n\n**15.Controlling others. How and why?**\n\nThis seemed to be the biggest problem my family currently have about me. My sister described me as a control freak, probably because I want everything to go my way. She's probably right, considering I always become anxious and critical (or as she said, salty) when things didn't go out as I predicted or planned, even if such events never included me at all. It's so strong, that even other people feel forced to accommodate for me. This always causes arguments with my mother, due to conflicting ideas.\n\n**16.Hobbies**\n\nVideo games and documentaries. Really distracts me away from the real world while simultaneously makes me understand the logic behind different worlds.\n\n**17.Learning styles, environment, classes type**\n\nI am more of a visual learner, since I see how it works before I mimic them. I am not good at auditory due to me easily spaced out while listening to an audio clip. I need a quiet, all to myself environment to learn things. Anything not that for me is chaos and chaos is among the worst distracting things in my mind. I prefer logic classes and I could apply it on other aspects. I suck at the physical ones though.\n\n**18.Strategizing projects**\n\nI am good at strategizing them, since I would instantly set who do what at that time. However, no one agrees on it as they see it as too fixed and hard. As such, I am forced to not follow my strategy. This is not a problem on solo tasks however.\n\n**19.What's important to me**\n\nTo establish a positive influence on society, which in the end proves I have made a contribution towards society, and the plans for all this must work out.\n\n**20.Aspirations**\n\nSee ***19.What's important to me***\n\n**21.Fears, hate, uncomfortable**\n\nMy three biggest fears are pain, death, and insects. The pain and death are related and I don't want such suffering upon myself as I couldn't imagine myself going through it, especially when I haven't even done anything mentioned in ***19.***. Insects are disgusting and sometimes deadly so please no.\n\nMy two biggest hates are liars and chaos. Liars had brought me so much pain for my past and the unreliability they give out makes me want to erase them. I see chaos as everything wrong about everything and I must have it fixed.\n\nMy biggest uncomfortable aspect is interpersonal things. Not being a hermit once in a while just doesn't feel right, yet being a hermit all the time is not healthy to myself.\n\n**22.Highs and Lows of life**\n\nMy past is essentially the lows of my life. Such hardships that I don't want to relive ever again. The highs are not there, but it is really a low bar though so it should be fine later, right?\n\n**23.Attachment to reality and daydreaming**\n\nIt is an understatement to how much I daydream, due to my personal desires to run away from the harsh reality. As such, I could just lose awareness, only for someone to snap me right back because they think I just froze or something.\n\n**24.What to do and think in a blank empty room**\n\nRelive my daydreams and go extreme heavy on the role-play. It is certainly possible I would role-play as everyone, of course daydream version of me is of upmost importance. Nobody is watching and nobody cares.\n\n**25.Decisions. How long and change?**\n\nI take my time to make decisions because I need to factor in some details and outcomes. It doesn't take too long (long enough to piss my mother off though) and once I made the decision, there is no changing or going back, as I see it insulting to myself.\n\n**26.Emotions. How long and important?**\n\nI purposely suppress my own emotions and never factor in emotions when it comes to anything as I see them rather inhibiting towards progress.\n\n**27.Agreeing with others to appease them? Often? Why?**\n\nIt seems to always end up in a disagreement with others and I will directly express my disagreements. Of course, this always kills the conversation. I would rather be honest about my opinions than to make them all happy.\n\n**28.Break rules? Challenge authority?**\n\nI don't want to be labeled as a lawbreaker as it is against my personal code of law. I will never break rules unless there is no consequence with the added benefit of doing so. There is a reason an authority is there, which is to install law and order. I would rather not challenge, unless they are doing a really bad job as an authority, and that is where another far better alternative has to take charge.\n\n**29.Ideal life**\n\nMy daydream world, the likes of those in the blank room question (***24.***)."

If you didn't have the perception to match, you'd have to really limit your superspeed to even see, let alone react to your surroundings\n\nEven if you had the perception to match, there are still so many other problems to deal with. For one, you would have to accelerate slowly or you'd just knock yourself out or rip yourself/others apart. Running into bugs at high speed could literally poke holes in you. Running at extreme speeds would also compress and heat up the air in front of you, making you a literal meteor zipping about.\n\nThe best way to use super speed would just be running around 60 mph or using the super-perception to help you in everyday life.",

I don\u2019t wanna make the same mistakes again, so I\u2019d like to know how other med students manage their time because I\u2019m having trouble. I\u2019m not organized, I don\u2019t have discipline, and I always procrastinate. I realized that the best thing I can do for now is make a realistic schedule for myself that I can actually follow. I also need to change the way I study, so I\u2019d like to ask you guys about that too.\n\nSo if you guys don\u2019t mind, please tell me how your everyday schedule looks like (when you wake up, how you divide your study hours and breaks, how many hours you study for in total, if you have any hobbies that you manage to squeeze in your schedule, when you sleep, etc.)\n\nI\u2019d also like to know how you guys study. Do you attend class or find it easier to study on your own? Do you take notes during lectures or just listen then take notes afterwards? What efficient techniques do you use to memorize and retain all the information?\n\nThis is the schedule that I plan on following, so any advice about how to improve it is appreciated:\n- 5 AM: wake up and study for 2 hours (using the Pomodoro Technique)\n- 7 AM: workout\n- 8 AM: shower and get ready and go to uni\n- I have classes from 9 AM - 4 PM and I usually get home my 4:30 PM and I rest for 30 minutes\n- 5 PM: study for 4 hours (using the Pomodoro Technique)\n- 9 PM: sleep\n\nNow about HOW to actually study, I\u2019m not sure. This is what I have planned so far: I\u2019ll attend lectures (since I find it easier to learn when someone else explains the material, idk how to self study) and to help me stay focused, I can take quick notes as the professor explains (I never actually use them again they\u2019re just so I don\u2019t fall asleep or get distracted). When I get home, Ill go over the lecture and review anything I didn\u2019t understand and watch videos to make sure I understand everything. Then I\u2019ll use anki to make flash cards that I can review on a daily basis."

It\u2019s not because I feel discouraged (in fact I see failure as an experience and a great learning opportunity), but it\u2019s because I don\u2019t know how to study. High school was easy for me and I always crammed and never really put in much effort, but med is very different. I\u2019m not used to long term studying and I don\u2019t know how to stay on top of my work. I\u2019m considering switching to an easier major simply because I don\u2019t know how to study and that\u2019s what discourages me. My parents think I\u2019m lazy and that I don\u2019t try at all but I genuinely don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I sit at my desk for hours and I either can\u2019t focus or I study but reaaaalllyy slow and I just fall behind and lose motivation. I feel like that\u2019s a dumb reason to switch majors and I really don\u2019t want to make a stupid decision that I\u2019ll regret in the future because study habits are something that can be learned/changed but I just can\u2019t figure out what to do. I tried using anki but that still doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m slow at studying and eventually give up.\n\nI feel like me switching majors will give me temporary relief from the crazy work load but I\u2019ll hate myself for it in a few years. I don\u2019t want to leave med but I don\u2019t know what to do. I won\u2019t lie and say it\u2019s my passion and all that bs because I really don\u2019t have any passions in life but I do enjoy it (when I\u2019m not struggling to study and catch up on my work lol).\n\nAlso generally speaking, both my mental and physical health have been deteriorating this past year and I feel burned out so that adds to the struggle. Like I really want to study and be productive and I always get these random moments where I\u2019m so motivated but once I actually open a lecture and it\u2019s time to get to work it\u2019s as if my brain just shuts down and says no. \n\nI plan on taking care of my physical health and eating healthy, hitting the gym, getting enough sleep, etc. to boost my mental health and focus, so hopefully that will be taken care of. But that still doesn\u2019t change the fact that I legit don\u2019t know how to study effectively. So please any specific tips on effective/efficient study methods or time management tips would be greatly appreciated (I really can\u2019t find any helpful tips online almost every website just has vague tips). Like do you guys take notes during lectures or just listen, how do you memorize as quickly as possible, etc. like literally just how do you study. What\u2019s your daily routine? I need to make a decision ASAP if I really will switch majors and I want to stay convinced about med so I need to have some sort of plan for next year about how to fix my study habits if I\u2019m serious about passing."

After inserting the image, covering up the labels, and getting the message that my cards have been added to the deck, I would go to my deck and it would be empty. The solution is to go to tools then manage note types, press on IO then cards. Once you're there, you should have three boxes that say  Front Template, Styling, and Back Template. If they're empty, then that's where the issue lies. Follow the link I inserted and copy paste the text for each field respectively.\n\nThere were two other posts on here asking about this problem but I couldn't reply because they were unfortunately archived. I have an exam coming up and I was struggling with this issue for a few days now because I need IO for anatomy diagrams, so I hope anyone else struggling with this problem finds this post useful.\n\nHope this helps :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [https://github.com/Glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/wiki/Troubleshooting#card-template](https://github.com/Glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced/wiki/Troubleshooting#card-template)"

Though his guide is probably great, I would like a different technique/way to do it, one which would require more of my free time rather than night time, meditation etc, help me with that please. Another reason why I think his method wouldn't work for me is that I don't remember my dreams ever, at all. It's not like the classic \"I woke up and I can remember what happened for a short while\", I literally don't recall having any dream, from which I could lucid dream and then shift to astral projection.\n\nI don't wanna give up on this yet but I need a technique that would suit me better.

But there's just a few things that make no sense / could be better.\n\n1. Probably the most important one: Why can't Range Up just increase the overall size of the club hitbox, rather than offsetting it further in front of you? Too much range sometimes make club mode unplayable, even though Range should be an unanimous upgrade the higher it goes. Why does a \"One makes you larger\" pill provide so much more value than Range Up, by actually increasing both X and Y size of the club's range, compared to real range ups? This also makes utilizing Keeper's Sack dangerous because you often end up with a 12+ range stat\n\n2. There should be more cool item interactions like Mom's Knife - yeah it's a flat +4 DMG while increasing range, and yeah, ultimately DPS are still not as good as soul mode / normal mode Mom's Knife, but I think that's the Knife's problem. A flat +4 DMG, much higher range, and the fact that the club turns into an awesome Scythe is just all around great and truth be told, as a Dead God, the only time I'm happy seeing Mom's Knife is when I'm the Forgotten, even though it's \"weaker\" than just using it normally. So it would be awesome if other powerful items could have meaningful interactions as well. I bet it wouldn't be so hard to also add something like a small homing damage aura with Godhead that activate for some time every time you swing, sort of like Brimstone, and that throwing your club also has the usual damage Aura. Godhead is otherwise just extremely underwhelming with the Forgotten. Even though Godhead has already been more disappointing since Repentance\n\n3. Throwing the bone club feels tedious and meaningless at the moment. It could easily be turned into a viable secondary play style by giving it a fixed charging speed instead of being tied to tears, as well as full swing damage rather than reduced damage. It's much tougher to hit with a thrown club anyway, and when you end up doing less damage than if you had just swung your club melee, it just feels bad. Yes I know, for long ranged moments you have the soul, but we wouldn't need to cope with the soul so much if the club mode's thrown was just made a little more viable. It's shouldn't be a balancing question, but a playstyle question, if I want to throw my club and have it do normal damage while charging faster + at a fixed rate, then pls let me play that way\n\nUltimately these are issues that are somewhat small but make a big impact on the gameplay of the most fun character, hope that he gets a little extra love in updates soon"

                "body": "I can't belive I made that grammar mistake in the title.   \n**TL;DR:- 20/20's nerf was justified, but takes away from the \"feel\" of a game - coming from someone who played extensively before Repentance- The Godhead nerf was unjustified and doesn't represent a good enough reward for the tough challenges you need to beat to get it anymore, nor does it live up to the \"name\"**\n\nNow, I get it. You wanted to balance the game. Alright. Nothing too overpowered, and give some more power to weak items. A libra-minded approach, respectable in a way, understandable even.\n\nWhen I started playing Repentance for the first time just a few months ago, after not having touched TBOI in forever, I was appalled to see what has been nerfed. After now becoming something of a Dead God, having had the time to let the changes sink in, I actually feel like most of the nerfs were warranted and are more or less acceptable. However, there's two items specifically that are still a Quality-4-shaped thorn in my side...\n\n**Godhead and 20/20.** Let's start with 20/20.\n\nI understand that a 100% damage up just like that is a bit too much. I'm not even saying that this change wasn't warranted, it's just that it *hurts.* If you've been around since before Repentance, you will remember that pure dopamine-fueled joy you felt when you stampeded into that item room in great anticipation of what may await you. And if your teary eyes don't deceive you - there it is. 20/20. You knew that this run was as good as won. Not only that, but you knew that clearing those next rooms will be satisfying. Maybe you're not really the explorer type of guy, maybe you always want to go for that boss rush. And yet, here you are, clearing all the rooms there are, because it's just this much fun being able to trample on your enemies. I'm not saying it's not like that anymore, but... actually yeah that's what I am saying. It's still powerful, Quality 4 levels of powerful, yes, especially with the tearrate-negation removal properties it has for specific items, but... I don't know about you guys. It's just that every time I see it now, I merely see a shadow of an item, and I reminisce upon its previous glory. A good, fantastic item even, just simply not the holy grail it used to be. From a balancing standpoint, Edmund may have been warranted, I do not deny this. But from a \"feel\", and even an emotional point of view, I simply have to say it... this nerf hurt the total experience of  the game more than it added through the \"improved\" balance. Maybe it's just me...\n\n**Now, Godhead is a different horse entirely.**\n\nEven though Godhead had a status akin to Sacred Heart and other \"cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\"-tier items, it was actually not really all that powerful even back then, when put up against the likes of Sacred Heart. Which was alright, it was still fantastic in many ways unique enough to justify that it didn't give you an insane damage up in terms of pure statistical numbers. It set it apart from Sacred Heart, fantastic in its own unique way, even better with certain synergies like simple piercing tears or tear size increases. An earned, respectable place among the Quality 4 items, always a joy to behold and encounter. Even now seeing it gives you that rush, you KNOW you just got a run-winning item! Right? After all, you worked so hard for it. All 12 completion marks, in hard mode no less, with the Lost! Not the hardest character in the game anymore perhaps, but one that still requires you to push your skill to a commendable level before being able to even dream of acquiring those 12 precious completion marks. But here you are. You did it. After hours of grind, months of improving your skill to this point, you did it. And your grand prize? The **Godhead**. The head of a god - a simple, yet mesmerizing design, mysterious and yet straight forward. The name - the head of a god - told you everything you needed to know about this item. It was worth every death you experienced as the lost. A holy aura envelopes all of your tears - a minor caveat being that you lose a little bit of your tearrate. Not a big deal, completely understandable, given the ungodly power-up your tears received in return - Right?? So you step out of that angel room, satisfied with the treasure you procured, and eagerly you step into the next uncleared room in your way with unprecedented confidence. You shoot, you clear the room, and then - Hm. A power up to be sure, but that aura... you keep playing. It's just... you beat another few bosses. At this point it's clear. That aura simply isn't what it's cracked up to be. Why? I'll tell you why. Because now it deals a flat amount of 2 DMG 15 times per second. Doesn't sound too bad, until you realize that it doesn't even scale with your own damage anymore. Can you believe it was just 1.05 DMG per tick in early Repentance? I shudder to think of such a Godhead. Sure, this now means that low damage, high tearrate builds benefit a lot, compared to the aura, damage that scaled with your own, but this was circumventable by making 2 DMG per tick the minimum damage value for the aura - just one example I can come up with at the top of my head. It's simply not becoming of an item with such a godly aura and mythos around it. It's the GODHEAD, for Christ's sake. Not a Demigodhead, and especially not a Peasanthead!\n\nSure. If I play on PC, I can just fix this using mods. But not so on console. Just like everyone else playing on console, we must suffer the consequences of Edmund's decision. I will not become my money back... but I will be eternally sad until everything will be right again. I have hope."

I heard a musician on YouTube talking about how some artists try to dumb down their music to appeal to a stupid audience. He said that in reality, if an artist makes intelligent, expressive music, they will find an audience that is receptive. I think it\u2019s kind of like that in life. Have faith in others; if you think everyone is stupid and superficial, maybe you\u2019re the stupid and superficial one, or maybe your cynicism is a defense mechanism.

                "body": "Hey everyone! So I need a light for my rifle. I don't want to spend much more than $300. Primary concern is coyotes getting at my dog. Can't shoot skinwalkers if I can't see em at night in the sticks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Light Requirements:\\*\\*\n\nUltimately need a nice blend of spill and throw. I live on 2 acres, so I don't need to look across the void space and time, just enough to see the whole yard and a little beyond my yard. These are the lights I've found thus far. I'm coming to reddit, because it seems like I should either buy the name brand, Surefire, or go cheap and get the Streamlight. I assume I'm overlooking something and want the help of buyers/users of the other products. Anyway, reliability, a blend of spill and throw, and right around $300 at the most.\n\n\\- ($110) [Streamlight ProTac Rail Mount 2](https://www.amazon.com/Streamlight-88059-Professional-Flashlight-Batteries/dp/B01AXR8IKS?th=1) This is the cheapest, so I'd like this to be the one, but at literally half the performance of the other lights listed, I'm concerned about performance... and I hear lots of mixed opinions about Streamlight. I can't tell if it's people turning their nose up at them, or if the lights are sincerely poor quality products. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- ($265) [Arisaka 18650 w/ Malkoff E2XTL](https://arisakadefense.com/18650-series-light-black/) I spent an hour this morning poking thru arisaka's site. It seems like ALL of their light heads are 100% devoted to a very tight throw? Surely that can't be right, right? Well, this head seems like it's the closest to what I want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- ($309) [Modlite PLHv2-18650 Light Package](https://modlite.com/collections/rifle-mounted-lights/products/modlite-plhv2-18650-light-package?variant=31630445740068) The description says that it's the best blend of spill and throw... but it's only $20 less than Surefire? I prefer the look over Surefire, but everyone's always jizzing their pants over how awesome Surefire is. Not opposed, not sold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- ($330) [Surefire Dual Fuel Scout Light Pro](https://www.surefire.com/products/illumination/weapon-lights/scout-light-pro-dual-fuel/?sku=M640DF-BK-PRO) (found for $258 on Amazon) Not much more to say here. Definitely a safe bet, even if I'm not wild about the price tag, I know what I'm getting into. I know it's a good light.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's why I'm asking: at the very insignificant price tag difference, is there even a reason to consider the modlite or Arisaka? It doesn't even seem like the Arisaka should be on this list, as I'm like 51% sure that it's just a 100% throw light, with very little spill. Furthermore, is it a waste of my time and money to put a streamlight on my rifle? They seem like decent lights; I've used their pistol lights forever, but I don't have any experience with their rifle lights.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for the help, everyone. Also, if I misunderstood something, or overlooked something, by all means, feel free to mention it."

                "body": "Ultimately, I'm not looking for a supremely capable 'froder - something that gets really poor fuel economy but can go anywhere. I want something that gets decent fuel economy (preferably something like 17mpg in the city) that can go *most* places. Here's a more specific list of my needs, wants, and deal breakers below. Do you guys know of anything I might be overlooking?\n\n\n\nTo clarify: I think I'd prefer a 3 row SUV or crossover... but I'm not entirely opposed to a truck, so long as it meets the following criteria.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NEEDS**\n\n\n\n- Very spacious driver seat - I am a very large man, and I grow miserable being squished into tiny cars. I particularly liked Toyota's Tundra+Sequoia front seat. Extremely spacious. Toyota's 4Runner was also roomy, and acceptable, but I kinda had to pick a side to tuck my legs into.\n\n\n\n- Lots of interior storage. I like big glove boxes, deep center consoles, and the like... I'm something of a pack rat\n\n\n\n- 8\" or more of stock ground clearance, or can be lifted 10 be close to 10\" of ground clearance without sacrificing mpg's too much\n\n\n\n- moderately capable AWD/4WD system. I wanna go off road, but I'm not trying to fjord the grand canyon. I'm not sure how to qualify this, but I'm not trying to cross rivers that will swallow 75% of my car, go baja racing, climb something like a 70 degree incline. I want to hop curbs, go on uneven and rough terrain, shallow mud, rained out dirt roads, and head down some minor-moderate trails to get to places to drop my kayak, pitch my tent on an unmarked/unpreserved camp site, or make my rig the \"basecamp\" for that day's mountain biking run. I... hope that makes sense?\n\n\n\n- Decent reliability. I like to own vehicles for a very long time. I want to drive a vehicle for at least 250k miles without a major failure like the engine, transmission, AC compressor (I live in Florida), transfer case, etc.\n\n\n\n**BUDGET:**\n\nTotal build has to be no more than $35k - yes, I am willing to wait until after the current car price crisis. In general, I have no problem paying $10k for a Nissan Armada that gets 13mpg in the city if I only paid $10k for it. I drive about 30k miles per year, so at $4/gal x 30k miles, we're looking at something like $9.2k per year in fuel cost. I'm really not okay with an annual fuel cost like that, but I'm *definitely* not okay with an annual fuel cost like that on top of something like a $30k suv, like for example: a 2020 Nissan Armada. Did I explain that clearly?\n\n\n\n**WANTS:**\n\n\n- cooled seats (again, I live in Florida)\n\n- dual zone climate control\n\n- at least 17mpg in the city (OR be cheap enough to offset the fuel cost, I'm looking at you, Armada and Sequoia)\n\n\n\n- Qualifies for Uber XL (generally speaking, it just needs to have a standard 3rd row, I don't expect any of you to keep track of this want)\n\n\n\n- Modern tech like a reverse cam, blind spot monitoring, a locking diff, terrain modes, electrical outlets in the rear cargo area/bed area (or cheap enough to add aftermarket)\n\n\n\n**VEHICLES ON MY RADAR:**\n\n\n\n- 2012-19 Ford Explorer (no Uber XL and not enough ground clearance, but perhaps it can take a lift due to it being body-on-frame? Needs more research)\n\n\n\n- 2014+ Toyota 4Runner (no Uber XL, a little outdated, but I'm otherwise happy with it. Will need upgrades for increased quality of life, thereby not 100% sold on this)\n\n\n\n- 2020 Kia Telluride (lacking off road capability, and thereby expensive for the performance, needs more research)\n\n\n\n- 2021 Kia Sorento (lacking off road performance, but cheaper than Telluride, needs more research)\n\n\n\n- 2008 or 2014 Toyota Sequoia (I love this thing. It meets almost everything I want... but the annual fuel cost is astronomical, it's a little outdated, and even the 2008 models are selling for like $30k... so I think this won't work - if it were half that price then I'd buy it immediately)\n\n\n\n- 2005-2012 Nissan Armada (I'll only buy this if I can get it super cheap. It'll be expensive to drive, it'll need lots of interior upgrades - starting with the driver seat, and honestly? It's pretty ugly.)\n\n\n\n- 2011 Toyota Highlander (seems like it lacks off-road performance, needs more research)\n\n\n\n- 2020 Toyota Highlander (much better all around, but still seems like it lacks off road performance; needs more research)\n\n\n\n- Willing to consider the Nissan Frontier so long as it's driver seat is roomy and it's 4 wheel drive equipped variant gets at least 17mpg in the city. I'm a little bit more rigid on the fuel requirements for trucks.\n\n\n\n**VEHICLES I'VE RULED OUT:**\n\n- Anything made by General Motors (Cadillac, Buick, GMC, + Chevy - I just don't like them)\n\n- Anything made by Subaru (long term reliability just isn't there, looking at you: CVT tranny paired with turbo'd boxer engine)\n\n- Not really a huge fan of Jeep as a brand, but not entirely opposed - definitely do NOT want a wrangler; too small inside cockpit.\n\n- Toyota Tacoma - it's just too small\n\n- 2020+ Ford Explorer (not enough capability off-road; clearance)\n\n- 2022 Nissan Pathfinder (too many failures of my \"needs\"; not enough off-road capability)\n\n- 2017+ Nissan Armada (costs too much to still get 14 mpg in the city)\n\n- 2016+ Honda Pilot (off-roading is an afterthought, not capable enough)\n\n- 2018+ Ford Expedition/Lincoln Navigator (not enough off-road capability for the price, otherwise it's basically perfect)\n\n- 2023 Toyota Sequoia (I love this... it just costs too much for me)"

I drive in Gainesville, FL (it's a college town) I've been driving UberX since December 2020, and I started out making approx $1,000 per week for 30 hours worth of driving. I'd land quite a bit in Quests, and it was great. I had a spinal injury and couldn't work a traditional job, so I switched to Uber full-time since I was earning so much for such little effort. \n\nWelp, last semester (Fall 2021) was the last of the good times. Now I work a few more hours, get no Quests, and struggle to earn half of what I was making previously. There's hardly ever any surges anymore, so I assume there are more Uber drivers in the area. \n\nIs there... any solution to this? (Aside from \"just move to a different city\" - I'm surrounded by lots of rural areas. I'd have to drive like 1.5-2 hours away to get to a place big enough to earn decent money)\n\n**(2) Uber gives me even less info than before**\n\nPreviously, Uber gave me very little info. They'd tell me how long the trip would be and how far away they were from me, plus their star rating. Wasn't thrilled about it, but at THAT was better than what I get now. Now, all I get is their star rating an \"the pickup spot is 5 minutes away from you\"\n\nJust yesterday I picked up a man, only to find out he wanted a drive to Pensacola, a town that's 5 hours away from me. I had the great pleasure of apologizing, and declining him when I discovered where we were headed. He was understandably upset and said I was the third driver to do this to him. \n\nIt's extremely frustrating. It's also not the first time this has happened. \n\nA couple weeks ago, I went down to Sarasota to see my family due to a death in the family. I was told that there are hardly any Uber drivers in Sarasota, and I got EVERY detail. How far away to pick up, how long the drive would be, how much I'd earn from the trip. \n\nDoes Uber seriously move this stuff around to incentivise/de-incentivise drivers? \n\nI know Uber is gig work, and I'm not supposed to be so reliant upon it, but this sucks."

I am asking because it seemed many people enjoyed, while I didn't. I read the book previous to the series, and I was really pleased, like the other works of Jane Austen. Like I've said in a previous post, I thought it was thoroughly different. \n\nThey extended and created some stages, distorted some others. I'm not even talking about some characters. They also made an 8 episodes series from a book 2 or 3 times tinier than P&P (which was enough consistent to have 6 episodes max). It was Netflix-ified, and while I call every Jane Austen's works \"subtle\", this adaptation was far from it.\n\nWhat about the end ?! To sum it up, I've never been that frustrated from an adaptation of a period drama \ud83d\ude05.\n\nWhat do you think about the differences between the book and the series ? I'll gladly hear about your different points of view."

Once you get in you are dead, they find you without ferocity you are dead, there is no bush you are dead at least give him just a one high cool down skill for escaping or even making him somehow useful in teamfights. You can't jump on to a carry in a teamfight if only one of enemy out of five has a cc which they will have. \n\nAnd another side note make his emp. W a flat heal regen. Not an bs soup with resistance and grey health like what is the point of it?\n\n\nEdit: Also you can't even oneshot adc's with triple q anymore they either build shieldbow + steelcaps or dash away and kite you till death if there is no bush. This champs is made to be a jungler but can't even gank mid without ult or flash. I love Rengar but he gets countered by every single thing in this game just to be able to kill carries instantly."

It's really not about expectations even AC odyssey has more immersion in its world. If I wasn't hyped too much about this game i was long quit. Finished all side and main missions but last hours were total waste of time I didn't enjoy it I was just spending time. They can fix bugs, optimization and even ai but this games problems are more than just these things. I would give it 8/10 at best and even if there wasn't technical issues I still wouldn't give it 9/10.\n\nI thought this game would have replayability in it but you could just start last mission again for seeing all different endings. I really don't feel like starting another save for a different build maybe after February but I have little to no hope. \n\nGunplay, side and main missions, character build types are okay and they give you different approach options for gameplay but it's just bland, more you play you feel more dissatisfied. Every mission ends same no matter how you play only differences are just couple of dialogue options. Good for first playthrough tho, pretty interesting stories but not enough to make you play again.\n\n\nStory was pretty good I enjoyed every main mission and endings were satisfying but this is no movie or Quantic dream game. \n\n\nI'm also fine with driving for me it was pretty enjoying.\n\n\n\nI wonder what you think they can add and improve in game?"

                "body": "Preface: This is a really shitty essay as I wrote in November of 2021. My intent was to get it peer edited but my friend never ended up doing it so here you go.\n\n**TLDR**:\n\nIn my opinion the Five Kage Summit Arc is one of the best arcs in all of Naruto and plays an integral role in the world building of the Naruto story. It also adds depth to not only the story but to our main characters Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura. And introduces us to new characters like the other Kage.\n\nNaruto is a story that displays a lot of highs and lows within an arc. I believe this arc is a testament to that. To me this arc adds a totally new layer to the story, expanding on the fundamentals set at the beginning of the story while feeding us more additional content that can stand on its own. It brings high stakes to the story, knowing if anything goes wrong another war can break out. It has an element of chaos, like when Sasuke attacks the summit which creates more conflict and keeps us on the edge of our seats. We also see Sasuke going further down the path of darkness as he tries to reconcile with the truth of his brother through the act of revenge. Naruto finds himself on a noble path to rid the world of hatred and bring about world peace which is constantly challenged in this arc. Madara is in the shadows scheming and planning behind the scenes. He always has a plan for if things go bad and as the cherry on top, declares war on the Five Great Nations. From start to finish this arc furthers the conclusion of the last and sets the stage for the next. This arc to me is unmatched by most in the story.\n\n**Part 1: World Building & Politics**\n\nNaruto\u2019s story is filled with lore and strong structures. One of the earliest pieces of Naruto lore we are introduced to is the Five Kage and the Five Great Nations. However we are never shown the real Five Kage until after the Pain Arc. The Five Kage Summit was (and still is) an integral part of world building within the Naruto Universe. For starters we are introduced to the Four other Kages and the Daimyo (or Feudal Lords) who\u2019s political powers exceed that of the Kages, secondly we see a sub conflict for a battle of power in the Leaf. Konoha\u2019s political elite are divided due to the Pain assault. One side wanted the Will of Fire to prevail (Shukaku who supported Kakashi to replace an unconscious Tsunade) and the other side pointing out that the Will of Fire brought the destruction of Konoha (Danzo, Homura, and Koharu wanting Danzo to replace Tsunade as Hokage). This battle would be won by Danzo Shimura (in the short term) who has been planning his way to the office of Hokage for decades. An additional part that contributes to the story is how it mimics the real world. For example, Samurai and Land of Iron are very similar to the Swiss (neutral buffer zone for international relations, snow like the Alps, Five Kage Summit like the G7, ect) I could even go as far as saying they were based on them. Another important role the Five Kage Summit Arc does is connecting the politics of the Naruto Universe all together. By bringing the Five Kage together we peer into the past wars (1st-3rd Great Shinobi War) and consequential political moves (like hiring the Akatsuki or the birth of the Blood Mist Village just to name a few) which in the end shows that Danzo isn\u2019t the only person at the table with a shady past. And that is what causes nobody to trust each other and increases tensions.\n\n**Part 2: High Tensions**\n\nAnother phenomenal occurrence within the Five Kage Summit Arc are the high tensions displayed throughout the arc. If something goes bad we could very well see another war start as a result of it. One point of tension is Sasuke\u2019s showing at the Five Kage Summit (which was done so epically), as a wanted fugitive, this shows how much he doesn\u2019t care and that he isn\u2019t afraid of the Kage. Another being how nobody trusts one another. The Hokage has a shady past as \u201cThe Shinobi of Darkness'', the Kazekage is believed to be too young, naive, and lacking of overall experience, also his father once used the Akatsuki (just Orochimaru, who\u2019s departure wasn\u2019t documented) to destroy the Leaf (during the Chunin Exams), the Mizukage\u2019s village was known to be a violent place that thrived on depraved acts as well as being the rumored birth of the Akatsuki the latter would especially make her untrusted, the Raikage is shown to have a lack of control on his anger and impulses, as well as aggressively blaming the other Kages for their pasts which makes him heavily disliked by the other Kage, and the Tsuchikage\u2019s lack of respect for Gaara, stubbornness to hold onto the ways of the past, and past use of the Akatsuki in response to the Clouds further growing power this deemed him untrustworthy in the eyes of the other Kage. Ay also points out that all of the Akatsuki members were rogue ninja from their villages (the Cloud not producing a single one) to boost his credibility. All together this displays the lack of trust and makes unification a joke in the eyes of many. When things are framed like this it is no surprise that Danzo is ultimately chosen out of everyone else under the guise of having possession of the last Jinchuriki, having experience in war and combat, and from what we can extrapolate from the previous statement having the least amount of dirt on him. Or does he? It is later exposed by Ao that Danzo used Kotoamatsukami on Mifune to promote his will. This is a violation of the rule to not use genjutsu. And it is this that destroys all credibility for Danzo and thus he isn\u2019t allowed to lead the Allied Shinobi Force and isn\u2019t trusted by anyone. However, in my opinion the biggest tension of all is Sasuke being consumed by hatred and how Madara (Tobi) uses that to his advantage.\n\n**Part 3: Sasuke\u2019s Descent Into Darkness**\n\n\u201cI shut my eyes a long time ago, the things I seek now lie only in the darkness.\u201d- Sasuke Uchiha\n\nSasuke\u2019s act of capturing Killer Bee for the Akatsuki was undoubtedly the catalyst for the Five Kage Summit and the Raikage\u2019s rage. This also made him a wanted man by the Hidden Cloud and Leaf after Danzo ordered his assasination. After learning the truth about his brother Sasuke was at a crossroads, he had two options, to either defend Konoha or attack it. To no one's surprise he chose the latter. His goal was to destroy Konoha for denouncing his brother even though he brought them peace. He believed that Danzo, Homura, and Koharu weren\u2019t the only ones to blame and instead focuses his vengeance on the whole village for undermining Itachi\u2019s sacrifice. After some clarification from Madara that Pain decimated Konoha, he was led to the Five Kage Summit by Zetsu to take his first act of revenge, this time against Danzo. Madara\u2019s objective is to test Sasuke\u2019s power and see how far the true depths of his powers really are, especially his Susanoo. By fighting against Kage level ninja (Mei, Ay, Onoki, Gaara, and Danzo) this would be the best way to do it. Many tried to reason and save Sasuke from his hatred including Gaara, but Sasuke was becoming ever so blind (literally and metaphorically) to not take his offer of redemption. Sasuke was completely consumed by hatred, and while Naruto was surrounded by allies and friends Sasuke was never more alone (this is also signified by the opening \u2018Diver\u2019 which was used during the first half of the arc). Sasuke\u2019s plans get set back as the other Kage engage in battle with him and Danzo escapes amidst the ensuing chaos. During his battle with the Raikage, Karin is even able to sense that Sasuke\u2019s chakra is darker than before and that he\u2019s practically a new person. Sasuke\u2019s depravity is shown further when he nearly kills Karin while piercing her and Danzo\u2019s heart. This shows that he has no qualms with killing her for being useless and that Karin is expendable and replaceable. Speaking about replacements he then tells Sakura to kill her so she can replace her but really done it to distract her while he kills her. Sasuke doesn\u2019t value Sakura even as her former teammate (though she was trying to kill him). It seems more like he\u2019s trying to kill an annoying fly. That is how little regard is shown. In the past Gaara tried to reason and empathize with Sasuke but to no avail. This time he's best friend and rival Naruto would try to salvage what\u2019s left of their friendship and bury the hatchet. Would Naruto clear Sasuke\u2019s hatred?\n\n**Part 4: Naruto\u2019s World Falling**\n\n\u201cIf there's truly such a thing as peace in this world I\u2019ll never stop looking.\u201d- Naruto Uzumaki\n\nAt the end of the Pain Arc Naruto promised to Nagato that he would find peace to end all of the hatred in the world. I believe this arc was a good way of testing Naruto\u2019s resolution. The first instance we see of this is when he gets continuously punched in the face by Karui out of vengeance for what Sasuke\u2019s done to Killer Bee. Naruto eventually gives Karui some hope by telling her Bee most likely isn\u2019t dead. The second attempt is made on the Raikage. Naruto profusely begs the Raikage to spare Sasuke which at the time is seemingly impossible and rude. Naruto is then provoked by Madara Uchiha, the beacon of hatred. In this conversation Madara spills the beans about Itachi\u2019s truth to Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato. He then goes on to talk about the history of the curse of hatred and how Naruto and Sasuke are next in line. Naruto is strong willed however knowing about the truth of Itachi\u2019s actions and how they\u2019d affect Sasuke\u2019s stresses Naruto out. In my opinion the domino effect is in full force, but it didn\u2019t start here.\n\nBefore Naruto went to the Five Kage Summit to plead to the Raikage he had a talk with Konoha 11. They all chose to give up on Sasuke and have even decided it's best if they take him out, Naruto being the only one in opposition telling them he\u2019ll find a way. This is where I believe the domino effect to start. However, what fully pushed Naruto off the edge was finding out Sakura\u2019s plan to kill Sasuke. Sakura attempted to manipulate Naruto into thinking she loves him which he saw through but still didn\u2019t see the bigger picture of her intentions. Sai then reveals her plan to kill Sasuke which pushes him off the edge (the final domino) where he starts to hyperventilate and pass out. To me this is an underrated scene in all of anime. Naruto has a huge task of ridding the world of hatred but can\u2019t because his problem has become too big to handle and when he has his close friend wanting to kill his best friend on top of that, he starts to panic. And when he doesn\u2019t have the power to do anything he can\u2019t control his own breathing (something we believe to be so minor) and passes out. Truly amazing. Another thing I want you to be aware of is: what does Karui, the Raikage, and Konoha 11 all have in common? The answer is they all have hatred for Sasuke. I believe Naruto was doomed from the start. While riding the world of hatred is a daunting task I believe Naruto is somewhat capable of making it happen. However, he never does anything conducive to reach that result. For example, getting beat senseless by Karui isn\u2019t going to bring Bee back to her (hypothetically). And how does he expect to get the hatred out of the world when his friends have hatred inside their hearts?\n\nBut that isn\u2019t to say Naruto\u2019s future attempts wouldn\u2019t be bad or even a failure. When speaking with Sasuke after his fight with Danzo and his brief fight with Kakashi (where even Kakashi was prepared to kill Sasuke) Naruto finally takes a stronger stand for his cause. Naruto tries to empathize with Sasuke saying \u201cWhat you\u2019ve been doing, I get it Sasuke.\u201d No one ever tried to understand Sasuke instead of seeing him as a victim of the world's hatred, everyone saw him as an aggressor who inflicts hatred on the world (which is half true). This shocks Kakashi and Sakura and even angers Sasuke. After hearing Sasuke\u2019s ambition to destroy the Hidden Leaf it becomes clear to Kakashi that Sasuke is a victim of the Cycle of Hatred. But this doesn\u2019t stop him from wanting to kill Sasuke. I can only assume he wanted to free Sasuke from his hatred by killing him. After Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s Rasengan and Chidori hit each other they\u2019re able to read each other\u2019s thoughts. Naruto again tries to empathize with Sasuke and his choices. Reminiscing about how he was younger and hated the villagers for how they ridiculed him for being a Jinchuriki. He believes had something gone differently he\u2019d be on the same path Sasuke\u2019s on. But unlike Sasuke, Naruto had the former and Iruka sensei to be there for him. They kept him afloat when his boat was sinking down the ocean of revenge. However, this doesn\u2019t change Sasuke at all. He\u2019s unphased and tells Naruto he\u2019s still going to kill everyone in the village, including Naruto, so instead of trying to save him he ought to be the savior who saves them from extinction. Naruto doesn\u2019t believe Sasuke. He then says he's not going to be a loser nor be the hero who kills Sasuke. Further on, Naruto affirms to Sasuke that he is his friend and will die for and with him. This gets Sasuke to agree to fight to the death (Sasuke\u2019s view being that he\u2019ll take Naruto down first). This by all means is a success. In this arc Naruto was never able to speak to anyone and help them overcome their hatred. While Sasuke\u2019s hatred hasn\u2019t dissipated yet Naruto has got Sasuke to see a different view and fight him to the death (where I\u2019d assume Naruto would want to change Sasuke\u2019s mind then and there, and Sasuke to kill Naruto and destroy the Leaf). But is this Sasuke\u2019s will or the acts of someone else in the shadows?\n\n**Part 5: Madara Pulling The Strings**\n\nMadara or rather \u2018Tobi\u2019 has an identity shrouded in mystery (at the time). However, Madara knew about Itachi\u2019s sacrifice for Sasuke and Konoha in general. He uses this to manipulate Sasuke. Madara is a great storyteller and can frame things in a certain way. That isn\u2019t to say Itachi didn\u2019t sacrifice a lot in the act of killing his family but Madara in some way made Itachi look like a martyr or a Christ like figure when he\u2019s far from that. Sasuke, a usually rational person, questions the content of Madara\u2019s words, but gets adequate answers. He then believes his story and it totally crushes him. This causes Sasuke to be short sighted and not question the motivations of Madara and instead take what he says at face value. Sustaining injuries that nearly cost him his life when fighting the Raikage, Danzo, Kakashi, and becoming blind from overusing his Mangekyou Sharingan Madara is able to manipulate Sasuke by displaying an illusion of options. He first tells him everything he knows about Itachi, framing it in a way that would make Itachi look like the second coming of Christ (which causes outrage) and then display options for Sasuke either A. Be passive or B. Get revenge. It\u2019s no surprise Sasuke chose the latter. Had he chosen the former Madara would have to take different measures in order for Sasuke to be on his side (if anyone wants to go into that hypothetical down in the comments do so I\u2019d love to hear it). But it\u2019s clear Sasuke didn\u2019t act out of his own free will.\n\nBut Madara doesn\u2019t stop there, he even speaks to Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato. He begins by again exposing Itachi\u2019s truth. No one believes him or at the very least questions the validity of his statement. Through hearing this though Naruto can understand Sasuke\u2019s point of view and why he did the things he did. Madara additionally states that it is Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s destiny for them to fight against each other due to being descendents of the Sage of Six Paths children. He even goes as far as saying he\u2019ll deliberately have Sasuke fight Naruto, which oddly works later on after their dialogue agreeing to fight to death (it's weird how Madara instigates things and somehow makes them happen).\n\nWhat makes this arc best though is how everything culminates in Madara\u2019s quest for Project Tsuki No Me and his declaration of war against the Five Great Nations. This forces them to unite against Madara, in the past Danzo wanted to unite them under false pretenses (for his own power), going as far as to use Kotoamatsukami on Mifune. After all of the history these nations have had against each other they\u2019re willing to put their differences aside and unite to fend off a greater evil. This is the cherry on top for me. It not only sets the stage for the next arc but even advances Naruto\u2019s goal of reaching world peace and ridding the world of hatred.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nNaruto is a story that displays a lot of highs and lows within an arc. I believe this arc is a testament to that. To me this arc adds a totally new layer to the story, expanding on the fundamentals set at the beginning of the story while feeding us more additional content that can stand on its own. It brings high stakes to the story, knowing if anything goes wrong another war can break out. It has an element of chaos, like when Sasuke attacks the summit which creates more conflict and keeps us on the edge of our seats. We also see Sasuke going further down the path of darkness as he tries to reconcile with the truth of his brother through the act of revenge. Naruto finds himself on a noble path to rid the world of hatred and bring about world peace which is constantly challenged in this arc. Madara is in the shadows scheming and planning behind the scenes. He always has a plan for if things go bad and as the cherry on top of the story, declares war on the Five Great Nations. From start to finish this arc furthers the conclusion of the last and sets the stage for the next. This arc to me is unmatched by most in the story.\n\nOne main criticism I have for this arc is the power scaling. The Susanoo ruined the consistency of the Naruto power system. While it did have its drawbacks with the MS it doesn\u2019t with EMS which makes anyone with the EMS a god. I\u2019m sure you guys can probably think of way more things to criticize this arc for. But for me this is the end of this essay."

My intent was to get it peer edited but my friend never ended up doing it so here you go.\n\n \n\n**TLDR**: \n\nIn my opinion the Five Kage Summit Arc is one of the best arcs in all of Naruto and plays an integral role in the world building of the Naruto story. It also adds depth to not only the story but to our main characters Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura. And introduces us to new characters like the other Kage.\n\nNaruto is a story that displays a lot of highs and lows within an arc. I believe this arc is a testament to that. To me this arc adds a totally new layer to the story, expanding on the fundamentals set at the beginning of the story while feeding us more additional content that can stand on its own. It brings high stakes to the story, knowing if anything goes wrong another war can break out. It has an element of chaos, like when Sasuke attacks the summit which creates more conflict and keeps us on the edge of our seats.

Madara is in the shadows scheming and planning behind the scenes. He always has a plan for if things go bad and as the cherry on top, declares war on the Five Great Nations. From start to finish this arc furthers the conclusion of the last and sets the stage for the next. This arc to me is unmatched by most in the story.   \n\n**Part 1: World Building & Politics**\n\nNaruto\u2019s story is filled with lore and strong structures. One of the earliest pieces of Naruto lore we are introduced to is the Five Kage and the Five Great Nations. However we are never shown the real Five Kage until after the Pain Arc. The Five Kage Summit was (and still is) an integral part of world building within the Naruto Universe. For starters we are introduced to the Four other Kages and the Daimyo (or Feudal Lords) who\u2019s political powers exceed that of the Kages, secondly we see a sub conflict for a battle of power in the Leaf. Konoha\u2019s political elite are divided due to the Pain assault. One side wanted the Will of Fire to prevail (Shukaku who supported Kakashi to replace an unconscious Tsunade) and the other side pointing out that the Will of Fire brought the destruction of Konoha (Danzo, Homura, and Koharu wanting Danzo to replace Tsunade as Hokage). This battle would be won by Danzo Shimura (in the short term) who has been planning his way to the office of Hokage for decades. An additional part that contributes to the story is how it mimics the real world. For example, Samurai and Land of Iron are very similar to the Swiss (neutral buffer zone for international relations, snow like the Alps, Five Kage Summit like the G7, ect) I could even go as far as saying they were based on them. Another important role the Five Kage Summit Arc does is connecting the politics of the Naruto Universe all together. By bringing the Five Kage together we peer into the past wars (1st-3rd Great Shinobi War) and consequential political moves (like hiring the Akatsuki or the birth of the Blood Mist Village just to name a few) which in the end shows that Danzo isn\u2019t the only person at the table with a shady past. And that is what causes nobody to trust each other and increases tensions.\n\n**Part 2: High Tensions**\n\nAnother phenomenal occurrence within the Five Kage Summit Arc are the high tensions displayed throughout the arc. If something goes bad we could very well see another war start as a result of it. One point of tension is Sasuke\u2019s showing at the Five Kage Summit (which was done so epically), as a wanted fugitive, this shows how much he doesn\u2019t care and that he isn\u2019t afraid of the Kage. Another being how nobody trusts one another. The Hokage has a shady past as \u201cThe Shinobi of Darkness'', the Kazekage is believed to be too young, naive, and lacking of overall experience, also his father once used the Akatsuki (just Orochimaru, who\u2019s departure wasn\u2019t documented) to destroy the Leaf (during the Chunin Exams), the Mizukage\u2019s village was known to be a violent place that thrived on depraved acts as well as being the rumored birth of the Akatsuki the latter would especially make her untrusted, the Raikage is shown to have a lack of control on his anger and impulses, as well as aggressively blaming the other Kages for their pasts which makes him heavily disliked by the other Kage, and the Tsuchikage\u2019s lack of respect for Gaara, stubbornness to hold onto the ways of the past, and past use of the Akatsuki in response to the Clouds further growing power this deemed him untrustworthy in the eyes of the other Kage. Ay also points out that all of the Akatsuki members were rogue ninja from their villages (the Cloud not producing a single one) to boost his credibility. All together this displays the lack of trust and makes unification a joke in the eyes of many. When things are framed like this it is no surprise that Danzo is ultimately chosen out of everyone else under the guise of having possession of the last Jinchuriki, having experience in war and combat, and from what we can extrapolate from the previous statement having the least amount of dirt on him. Or does he? It is later exposed by Ao that Danzo used Kotoamatsukami on Mifune to promote his will. This is a violation of the rule to not use genjutsu. And it is this that destroys all credibility for Danzo and thus he isn\u2019t allowed to lead the Allied Shinobi Force and isn\u2019t trusted by anyone. However, in my opinion the biggest tension of all is Sasuke being consumed by hatred and how Madara (Tobi) uses that to his advantage. \n\n**Part 3: Sasuke\u2019s Descent Into Darkness**\n\n\u201cI shut my eyes a long time ago, the things I seek now lie only in the darkness.\u201d- Sasuke Uchiha\n\nSasuke\u2019s act of capturing Killer Bee for the Akatsuki was undoubtedly the catalyst for the Five Kage Summit and the Raikage\u2019s rage. This also made him a wanted man by the Hidden Cloud and Leaf after Danzo ordered his assasination. After learning the truth about his brother Sasuke was at a crossroads, he had two options, to either defend Konoha or attack it. To no one's surprise he chose the latter. His goal was to destroy Konoha for denouncing his brother even though he brought them peace. He believed that Danzo, Homura, and Koharu weren\u2019t the only ones to blame and instead focuses his vengeance on the whole village for undermining Itachi\u2019s sacrifice. After some clarification from Madara that Pain decimated Konoha, he was led to the Five Kage Summit by Zetsu to take his first act of revenge, this time against Danzo. Madara\u2019s objective is to test Sasuke\u2019s power and see how far the true depths of his powers really are, especially his Susanoo. By fighting against Kage level ninja (Mei, Ay, Onoki, Gaara, and Danzo) this would be the best way to do it. Many tried to reason and save Sasuke from his hatred including Gaara, but Sasuke was becoming ever so blind (literally and metaphorically) to not take his offer of redemption. Sasuke was completely consumed by hatred, and while Naruto was surrounded by allies and friends Sasuke was never more alone (this is also signified by the opening \u2018Diver\u2019 which was used during the first half of the arc). Sasuke\u2019s plans get set back as the other Kage engage in battle with him and Danzo escapes amidst the ensuing chaos. During his battle with the Raikage, Karin is even able to sense that Sasuke\u2019s chakra is darker than before and that he\u2019s practically a new person. Sasuke\u2019s depravity is shown further when he nearly kills Karin while piercing her and Danzo\u2019s heart. This shows that he has no qualms with killing her for being useless and that Karin is expendable and replaceable. Speaking about replacements he then tells Sakura to kill her so she can replace her but really done it to distract her while he kills her. Sasuke doesn\u2019t value Sakura even as her former teammate (though she was trying to kill him). It seems more like he\u2019s trying to kill an annoying fly. That is how little regard is shown. In the past Gaara tried to reason and empathize with Sasuke but to no avail. This time he's best friend and rival Naruto would try to salvage what\u2019s left of their friendship and bury the hatchet. Would Naruto clear Sasuke\u2019s hatred?\n\n**Part 4: Naruto\u2019s World Falling**\n\n\u201cIf there's truly such a thing as peace in this world I\u2019ll never stop looking.\u201d- Naruto Uzumaki\n\nAt the end of the Pain Arc Naruto promised to Nagato that he would find peace to end all of the hatred in the world. I believe this arc was a good way of testing Naruto\u2019s resolution. The first instance we see of this is when he gets continuously punched in the face by Karui out of vengeance for what Sasuke\u2019s done to Killer Bee. Naruto eventually gives Karui some hope by telling her Bee most likely isn\u2019t dead. The second attempt is made on the Raikage. Naruto profusely begs the Raikage to spare Sasuke which at the time is seemingly impossible and rude. Naruto is then provoked by Madara Uchiha, the beacon of hatred. In this conversation Madara spills the beans about Itachi\u2019s truth to Naruto, Kakashi, and Yamato. He then goes on to talk about the history of the curse of hatred and how Naruto and Sasuke are next in line. Naruto is strong willed however knowing about the truth of Itachi\u2019s actions and how they\u2019d affect Sasuke\u2019s stresses Naruto out. In my opinion the domino effect is in full force, but it didn\u2019t start here. \n\nBefore Naruto went to the Five Kage Summit to plead to the Raikage he had a talk with Konoha 11. They all chose to give up on Sasuke and have even decided it's best if they take him out, Naruto being the only one in opposition telling them he\u2019ll find a way. This is where I believe the domino effect to start. However, what fully pushed Naruto off the edge was finding out Sakura\u2019s plan to kill Sasuke. Sakura attempted to manipulate Naruto into thinking she loves him which he saw through but still didn\u2019t see the bigger picture of her intentions. Sai then reveals her plan to kill Sasuke which pushes him off the edge (the final domino) where he starts to hyperventilate and pass out. To me this is an underrated scene in all of anime. Naruto has a huge task of ridding the world of hatred but can\u2019t because his problem has become too big to handle and when he has his close friend wanting to kill his best friend on top of that, he starts to panic. And when he doesn\u2019t have the power to do anything he can\u2019t control his own breathing (something we believe to be so minor) and passes out. Truly amazing. Another thing I want you to be aware of is: what does Karui, the Raikage, and Konoha 11 all have in common? The answer is they all have hatred for Sasuke. I believe Naruto was doomed from the start. While riding the world of hatred is a daunting task I believe Naruto is somewhat capable of making it happen. However, he never does anything conducive to reach that result. For example, getting beat senseless by Karui isn\u2019t going to bring Bee back to her (hypothetically). And how does he expect to get the hatred out of the world when his friends have hatred inside their hearts?\n\nBut that isn\u2019t to say Naruto\u2019s future attempts wouldn\u2019t be bad or even a failure. When speaking with Sasuke after his fight with Danzo and his brief fight with Kakashi (where even Kakashi was prepared to kill Sasuke) Naruto finally takes a stronger stand for his cause. Naruto tries to empathize with Sasuke saying \u201cWhat you\u2019ve been doing, I get it Sasuke.\u201d No one ever tried to understand Sasuke instead of seeing him as a victim of the world's hatred, everyone saw him as an aggressor who inflicts hatred on the world (which is half true). This shocks Kakashi and Sakura and even angers Sasuke. After hearing Sasuke\u2019s ambition to destroy the Hidden Leaf it becomes clear to Kakashi that Sasuke is a victim of the Cycle of Hatred. But this doesn\u2019t stop him from wanting to kill Sasuke. I can only assume he wanted to free Sasuke from his hatred by killing him. After Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s Rasengan and Chidori hit each other they\u2019re able to read each other\u2019s thoughts. Naruto again tries to empathize with Sasuke and his choices. Reminiscing about how he was younger and hated the villagers for how they ridiculed him for being a Jinchuriki.

Naruto doesn\u2019t believe Sasuke. He then says he's not going to be a loser nor be the hero who kills Sasuke. Further on, Naruto affirms to Sasuke that he is his friend and will die for and with him. This gets Sasuke to agree to fight to the death (Sasuke\u2019s view being that he\u2019ll take Naruto down first). This by all means is a success. In this arc Naruto was never able to speak to anyone and help them overcome their hatred. While Sasuke\u2019s hatred hasn\u2019t dissipated yet Naruto has got Sasuke to see a different view and fight him to the death (where I\u2019d assume Naruto would want to change Sasuke\u2019s mind then and there, and Sasuke to kill Naruto and destroy the Leaf). But is this Sasuke\u2019s will or the acts of someone else in the shadows?\n\n**Part 5: Madara Pulling The Strings**\n\nMadara or rather \u2018Tobi\u2019 has an identity shrouded in mystery (at the time). However, Madara knew about Itachi\u2019s sacrifice for Sasuke and Konoha in general. He uses this to manipulate Sasuke. Madara is a great storyteller and can frame things in a certain way. That isn\u2019t to say Itachi didn\u2019t sacrifice a lot in the act of killing his family but Madara in some way made Itachi look like a martyr or a Christ like figure when he\u2019s far from that.

It not only sets the stage for the next arc but even advances Naruto\u2019s goal of reaching world peace and ridding the world of hatred. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nNaruto is a story that displays a lot of highs and lows within an arc. I believe this arc is a testament to that. To me this arc adds a totally new layer to the story, expanding on the fundamentals set at the beginning of the story while feeding us more additional content that can stand on its own. It brings high stakes to the story, knowing if anything goes wrong another war can break out. It has an element of chaos, like when Sasuke attacks the summit which creates more conflict and keeps us on the edge of our seats. We also see Sasuke going further down the path of darkness as he tries to reconcile with the truth of his brother through the act of revenge. Naruto finds himself on a noble path to rid the world of hatred and bring about world peace which is constantly challenged in this arc. Madara is in the shadows scheming and planning behind the scenes. He always has a plan for if things go bad and as the cherry on top of the story, declares war on the Five Great Nations. From start to finish this arc furthers the conclusion of the last and sets the stage for the next. This arc to me is unmatched by most in the story.\n\nOne main criticism I have for this arc is the power scaling. The Susanoo ruined the consistency of the Naruto power system.

                "body": "Before I start I think I have actually been banned since the second time I tried posting this it automatically just posted on my user page. If this is actually the mods (which I anticipated in the first sentence) this proves my point 100%. I was trying to be cordial and bridge the gap however they\u2019re contributing to the problem I speak of. Whichever one it is I\u2019d love to hear it u/mahmud_\n\nAnyways here\u2019s the post: Before the mods delete this post I want them to hear me out. \n\nHere is a quick TLDR from the conclusion; Regardless of how many of us feel this is a real issue that all of us have. To me, at the end of the day we are all Somali (which many of the dipshits will say I\u2019m not just because I\u2019m not Muslim), why can\u2019t we all get along and just coexist in this subreddit, talk about various pressing topics particularly within the Somali community? If we look at the bigger picture we haven\u2019t moved far past our elders' generation. Tribes have been replaced with faith (or lack thereof) and we are continuously fighting each other to no avail. So now I ask you, can we just live as one?\n\nNow I\u2019m an Ex-Muslim and many people here have an issue with that (no surprise there). I came to this subreddit to speak about things related to Somalia, not religion. So me not being Muslim has nothing to do with anything. I can make my own choices in life and shouldn\u2019t be crucified for it. \n\nI personally want to have honest and real conversations about our nation, culture, and it\u2019s people (In this post I also want to achieve something greater, bridging the gap between Muslim Somalis and Ex-Muslim Somalis). But I and others are finding it increasingly hard to do so when I or others pose a question and it has various reception. The biggest pattern I see is when certain people won\u2019t engage with the subject matter at hand, essentially deflect, and attack the OP. To give you an example I will be showing you a post from u/ToDonutsBeTheGlory and [his recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Somalia/comments/piofoq/poll_what_are_your_feelings_about_your_parents/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;context=3). In this post he talks about what others think about their parents' generation, specifically whether they A. Admire them B. Have no respect for them C. Are sympathetic towards them but still recognize that although they\u2019ve tried their best as parents they still failed. While I think the second answer is very cold, many do realistically feel that way. In a real world our parents aren\u2019t perfect and many fall short but we can\u2019t deny that certain parents are or were totally ruthless and abusive towards their children or have done certain things in which the child has chosen to not give their respect towards their parents, whether it's warranted or not. With that being said let's see how the responses are\u2026 Yeah I\u2019m not fucking surprised. Before I start giving my own opinions I will recognize that there are some really good answers. From people like u/Frankiepeterson, u/Djinneral, and u/TheMightyNomad. Now if you haven\u2019t forgotten the big pattern is that many won\u2019t engage with the subject matter and will attack the OP. Now we have unproductive responses from people like u/Sad_Sir9142 and u/Ace_Euroo who say stuff like [this](https://imgur.com/a/vEhvR7T) and [this](https://imgur.com/a/Y6LVU1R). \n\nI\u2019m so confused why we can have these kinds of conversations. No one in the Somali community has the balls to bring up real problems like this. Then we have spineless people who will shit on you for try to have conversations about things that are actually going on. Here\u2019s some advice for those who aren\u2019t competent enough to have direct answers, just downvote it and move on if you don\u2019t have something of value to add. Better nothing then a bunch of retarded bullshit that doesn\u2019t actually add to the conversation. And here's another bigger issue I have with this community. Its the smugness and arrogance that many (but not all) of you Muslim Somalis have (which is ironic because being arrogant is haram). When we mention that we are Ex-Muslim the idiots will use that as a means to discredit us and deflect from the real argument at hand. Not only that many of you speak all high and mighty like we are inferior to you just because we aren\u2019t Muslim like you all are. \n\nRegardless of how many of us feel, this is a real issue that all of us have. To me, at the end of the day we are all Somali (which many of the dipshits will say I\u2019m not just because I\u2019m not Muslim), why can\u2019t we all get along and just coexist in this subreddit, talk about various pressing topics particularly within the Somali community? If we look at the bigger picture we haven\u2019t moved far past our elders' generation. Tribes have been replaced with faith (or lack thereof) and we\u2019re continuously fighting a pointless battle to no avail. So now I ask you, can we just live as one?\n\nPS: In posting this I am expecting lots of backlash. I anticipate that many will say that I am mad, many will say I have no place in this subreddit, and many will ironically use my status as an Ex-Muslim against me. Which is why I believe it is important to read."

I want to pick Norway as my 1st choice, Sweden for 2nd, and Finland or France for 3rd. I've actually never been to Europe before so this is going to be extra interesting. I could put Sweden as my 1st pick honestly, I even have a friend here where I live who is from Sweden but... y'know, I just have a really good gut feeling about Norway, so I'm gonna go with that. \n\nNorway is the most beautiful place I've ever seen in pictures. I've heard all good things about this place, especially in terms of school. The people are very awesome, normally pretty quiet though. The air is cool, dry and fresh (I've read), the landscapes and nature is very beautiful, and it's very enjoyable to walk around and do things, which I like to spend time outside alone a lot lol.\n\nI want to know what to expect though, about the school, its courses (will I possibly have to do more school after coming home for more credits?), and anything else I should possibly do to adapt. It'll be a very different experience from Canadian school, so I'm sure anything would be useful in this area. How good is the English speaking on average? As a safety net option I would like to know, just in case, although I'll always give my 100% at Norwegian first.\n\nMaking friends is something I want to test myself on, but please I would like to know a few ways that you would recommend I try to connect with people. I'm not great at connecting but I need to work hard at making sure I can get it done.\n\nI'm very much looking forward to seeing people get back to me. I'm going to out in my application for going tonight if not then sometime soon. DMs are open for this one, if you have any useful input for me. Extra Norwegian lessons are appreciated (half joke). Thank you all for your time."

For whatever reason, I don't think I've fully grasped the concept.\n\nThe way I've interpreted it is to come up with a story idea, ranging from \"a young boy searches for his family\" to \"a king tries to rebuild an ancient empire\" and then start from there, rather than from large and complex themes, as those will come naturally as you write (that's what happens with me). Starting not from the top-down (themes and other complex subjects), but from the ground-up (story concept, characters and the likes).\n\nDid I interpret it right? Did I miss something or am I overthinking this? Would love to hear some of your opinions on this too."

After a couple of times of this happening every night, he soon stopped having a regular sleep schedule and took the habit of walking around at night.\n\nThat night, he took the same path he walked the night before, and the one before that, and the one before even that one. He passed by the same roads, the same buildings, all still in a pretty good state, seemingly untouched by the Gothic War. The buildings, whose shape he had memorized by now, reminded him of\u2026 nothing.\n\nFinally, Marco reached the sea. A small public beach, deserted all throughout the day, aside from the occasional child swimming in the water. Marco sat on the sand, and watched the waves crash on reefs in the distance.\n\nIt was a beautiful sight, with the dim moonlight shining on the Adriatic, a cold breeze passing through his hair. Marco could have stood there and watched it for hours, doing nothing.\n\nAnd in fact, he'd do nothing. Marco, with a giant black hole in his heart, sucking in all feelings he formed, gazed at the breath-taking sight, with a small tear coming down his cheek.\n\n\"Why, God\u2026. why\u2026\" He whispered, \"Fucking\u2026 feel something. Anything\u2026.\"\n\nMarco passed yet another peaceful night on that beach. An empty, wasted and peaceful night.\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\n\"Marco, there you are!\"\n\nMarco walked up to the bar's counter. The familiar voice of the barman was comforting, in a way. Marco waved at the man, and sat close-by, rubbing his eyes.\n\n\"White night?\" The barman asked.\n\n\"Unfortunately. Gimme a drink, Roberto.\"\n\n\"The usual?\"\n\n\"Yeah, the fucking usual\u2026\"\n\nRoberto, the barman, nodded. He grabbed a bottle of whiskey off a shelf and filled a drink with it, humming a tune while doing so.\n\nMarco always came in the morning to drink at the bar as a regular customer; one of the more profitable, too. Marco always looked at Roberto when drinking, trying to understand if he genuinely enjoyed talking to him, or if Roberto was only kind to him because of how many money he spent, trying to drown in alcohol.\n\nNo matter how hard he tried however, Marco could never manage to do so. He could never read Roberto, always smiling and energetic. It was so weird to see someone so happy in a war-torn country. Guess he was just that optimistic.\n\nWhen Marco finished his drink, he quickly asked for another and Roberto got to work.\n\n\"Say\u2026\" Roberto said, \"You're a war vet, right?\"\n\nMarco twitched for a second.\n\n\"I\u2026 was,\" Marco replied.\n\n\"Well, yeah, right. So, uh\u2026 I have a question. You know like those guys who hijacked Vittorini's speech some days ago?\"\n\n\"Who? The IRA?\"\n\n\"Yeah, those guys.\"\n\n\"Fuck 'em. They're gonna get killed.\"\n\n\"Well, I mean\u2026\" Robert stuttered. He quickly looked around before leaning in closer to Marco.\n\n\"Okay, look,\" he whispered, \"I'm friends with a police guy, smart dude and kinda charming. You following me so far?\"\n\n\"Yeah\u2026?\"\n\n\"Yeah, so\u2026 pretty charming and convincing dude. He felt inspired by the IRA and, while he isn't joining them, he convinced a pretty large group of the local police to desert, grab some weapons and go into the woods to start a resistance movement and all. And\u2026 uh\u2026\"\n\n\"And\u2026?\"\n\n\"And\u2026 since you're a military guy, I wanted to know if you wanted to\u2013\"\n\n\"N-no,\" Marco interrupted him, \"just\u2026 no.\"\n\n\"But\u2013\"\n\n\"I don't give a fuck about your rebellion!\" Marco began yelling.\n\n\"Marco\u2013\"\n\n\"No, no! I don't care, I'm not joining. I'm not\u2026 I'm not doing it. I don't wanna\u2026 I don't wanna\u2026\"\n\nThe bar fell into a deep silence. The two stood there for what felt like an eternity. Marco didn't know what to say.\n\n\"I'm\u2026 sorry. I didn't mean\u2013\"\n\nMarco's apology was interrupted by the arrival of another glass of whiskey.\n\n\"It's okay, dude,\" Roberto said, \"I\u2026 shouldn't have asked. We'll\u2026 do it on our own.\"\n\nHesitantly, Marco grabbed the drink and chugged it down his mouth.\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\n#**BREAKING NEWS**\n\n> **24 policemen steal weapons from their armory and then run away**"

Despite the bad acting and questionable effects, I thought it was a super cool story! \n\nSo to find out what happened with the rest of the story, I decided to watch the cartoon. I honestly remember kind of hating the first episode because Aang was so crazy compared to the stoic and serious Oong from the movie. Luckily, after about two more episodes I was completely hooked and realized just what an awful job the movie did. \n\nBut, I still find it hard to hate, because without it, I may have never watched Avatar and realized what an awesome show it is. \n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way?"

I'm an electrical engineer, and pretty much everything I've learned about networks so far I've stumbled through and I'm still very much new to this.\n\nMy research lab has developed a wireless device that is used during experiments to gather and stream data to our computers. Originally, I didn't think that I could set a static IP for the device on the university's wifi, so I set up the device as its own access point, where it could have a consistent IP that would facilitate connecting with it from our computers and talk back and forth using UDP.\n\nBecause we have to change networks though just to connect to the device, we're looking at alternate options. After some research as well as trial and error, I've discovered I can program the device to set a static IP even if it's joining a different network (not acting as an access point). The caveat is that the static IP has to be within a vague range of addresses that I can sort of figure out using a command prompt, but not all networks allow me to set a static IP. \n\nThis device is going to be disconnected and connected all the time, so the IP assigned by the router is going to change every once in a while. However, to communicate with the device from the computer requires that I know the IP address. But how am I supposed to know the IP address? I'm really struggling to figure out how all other IoT systems do this and connect to new devices on the fly. Is there some other communication protocol like Bluetooth being used before the wifi connection is established?"

There is foraging and fishing. Which was so cool at the  time I was like \"wow a shooter game with fishing this is amazing\". When I started Fortnite I was used to playing games like Skyrim/dragons dogma etc where healing yourself etc was done by a menu with no in game animations really so I really enjoyed watching my skin drink slurp and eat fish haha. \n\nI kept anticipating a limit of objects I could break, \"sure I can't destroy a house, that would make no sense\" its hilarious looking back at it now, I really thought you could only destroy trees and small objects because my logic was a person cannot walk up to a house or rock and break it so I was surprised I could do that in Fortnite.\n\nAs I was learning how the guns worked and how common beach was I found it interesting how common rifles and shotguns are used and I was thinking \"strange most of my kills are with a rifle\"  this helped me push myself to try other weapons not course. \n\nFortnite has a lot of mindful details in the map that make it so enjoyable I really did not expect so much diverse things in the game when I started playing, that said there is plenty of  features that are a no brained for Fortnite and hope they keep expanding in the future. \n\n\nI just wanted to share and hear from others what surprised you or did you enjoy seeing or things you did not expect when you started playing Fortnite? :)"

Currently the emote volume is tied to the sound effects setting. \n \n Several reasons why I think emote volume settings would be great: \n\nWhen you are changing game modes, some people may enjoy emoting in party royale or even creative more often and on the other hand you want to focus more on the sound effects in combative matches.\n\n \nEmotes also have varying volumes and this is specifically for people with headphones or earphones who may find loud emotes unmanageable when your earphones etc do not have an inbuilt volume just to reduce the emote sounds.\n\n \nThe pain of changing volumes per game depending on play style and mannerisms.\n\n\nAnother good reason to add this is because people often pay for emotes and would enhance gameplay to enjoy the emotes you pay for by having settings as suggested. \n\n \n(BONUS) add a slider to control how much of your emote you can hear versus another persons. I would much rather emote along with other people without my own sounds drowning them out on my end of things."

Collared/vaxed etc. \n\nOne day they returned home without their collars and my partner and I thought it strange as they we have no idea if they got stuck somewhere - they are well accustomed to people and friendly (although generally shy of strangers). \n\nMy partner thinks some random a--hole took them off. We replaced the collars with spares we had. We also went to buy 2 more new collars. The spare red one my female cat had on recently is really tight on the lock/buckle part and no cat has taken that collar off itself. She just came home - same time as the first incident. Without her red collar. As part of the new collars we bought to test our theory if some one was indeed taking these off, we bought a collar that does not have the safety snap mechanism but a belt buckle style.\n\nIf someone was taking these collars off (this has happened over this week and partly last week) how can catch who is doing this? This also makes me worry for the cats safety - do these people want to hurt cat? or are they just stupid stealing collars. The timing is always the same. 10-12am the cats return without a collar."

I started a new job about a month ago in a long term care home and quickly realized it was not for me. I was working full time nights, heavy workload, and often the only worker responsible for about 20 residents due to staff shortages and people calling in. I did not feel capable of meeting the expectations of management, I was run off my feet, and I felt that the care and safety of residents was compromised due to the amount of staff available at night. I would dread going into work the entire day, I'm talking bad anxiety where I would often be in tears. I cried at work multiple times.\n\nI thought I would get a handle on it but I never did. By last week I was so desperate to leave I started looking for another job and quickly found a higher paying one closer to my area. I called to set up a meeting with management and let them know I would be resigning. 2 days later I came in and let them know that as of that day I would be leaving. Now, I've never quit a job before, but I knew the professional thing to do was to give 2 weeks notice. However at the time of my decision I didnt think I had it in me to do 2 more weeks. I even discussed it with my coworkers and they said they wouldn't blame me for not giving 2 weeks. Anyways, management was NOT happy and I didnt feel I was able to properly express the toll that the job had taken on me. \n\nLong story short I now realize I was very unprofessional and feel super guilty to the point I just cant stop torturing myself over it. I wanted to do the right thing for my mental health but now I wonder if it would have been better to suffer through it."

As for study methods in general;\n\nPersonally, I get bored by writing summaries and reading them over and over, just doesn't work for me. My study process can be split in three phases.\n\n\n### 1. During Lectures\n\n- Try to pay attention in class (meds definitely help!)\n\n- Write down notes during lectures, highlight the most important parts.\n\n- Ask your professor questions if you have any. \n\nThis alone helps me understand the topic much better before the studying even begins. Saves me a lot of time (compared to when I daydreamed during lectures and had to catch up on everything later).\n\n\n### 2. After Lectures\n\n- Talk to other students about the topic, ask each other questions.\n\n- Try to explain the topic to a friend, a family member, a stuffed animal, ...\n\n- Watch YouTube videos about the topic to get a different (and perhaps more helpful) explanation.\n\nExplaining and talking about something I learned really helps me solidify the information I already know, while also helping me see what I need to improve on.\n\n\n### 3. Exam Preparation\n\n- Solve previous exams! Maybe your professor or past students can provide them. It's okay if you get many of them wrong, just try your best and focus on understanding the questions you struggled with.\n\n- Use flash cards (my favourite is Anki)\n\n- Mind Maps!\n\n- Skim through your study material (only to get an overview or to remember smaller topics.)\n\nAnswering questions about the topic makes me think about the material more intensely. Solving previous exams preps me for what kind of questions will be on the exam, which topics are more important to the professor etc.\n\n\n### In General\n\n- Reward yourself! I like to keep small chocolates nearby.\n\n- Try to keep a list of your lectures/topics, tick them off once you fully understand them (helps my motivation!)\n\n- Take enough breaks & try to get enough sleep.\n\n- Try out the Pomodoro Technique.\n\n- Have your roommate, friends or family help to keep you accountable.\n\n\nThis list is very overwhelming lol. I DEFINITELY don't do all of this every time (i wish!), it's a lot and I still struggle a ton with studying! \n\nAll in all, no method will help as much as medication and therapy imo. However, I try to incorportate as many of these tips as I can, because I found out they really work for me. Even just sticking to a handful of them has definitely helped a ton!\n\nEveryone's different though, what works for me might not work for you. Good luck with everything, hope I could help!",

I know it's very hard to get started on overwhelming tasks, don't beat yourself up about it.\n\nI'm really glad you recently got your diagnosis though! I didn't get it until last year when I was 22, I wish I'd got it much earlier. Once/if you take medication, I can assure you it will get easier - therapy and coaching also help a ton. \nMaybe try to talk to your school about your adhd, perhaps they can offer you some support or let you retake the test etc.\n\nThat being said, I wish you all the best for your exam! Try your best, maybe it goes better than you expected! And if not, don't be too hard on yourself - these things happen. If you ever want to vent or talk, feel free to message me anytime.\n\nGood luck!",

A while ago, he explained to me what skins are and showed me some that he really liked. I thought it would be nice to gift him some! Is that even possible? Is there a way for me to gift him money/valorant points to buy skins in-game, even if I don\u2018t have an account or play it myself? I saw some Valorant gift cards on Amazon, but I\u2018m not sure if they are legit.\n\nThanks for your help, I really appreciate it!"

The strengths of the INTP type are numerous, ranging from having big brains, to having big brains, having big brains, having big brains, and having big brains.\n\nENTPs are master debaters (don't remove the de please my mom is watching) and can crush your tiny ass cock with the sheer weight of their FACTS and LOGIC. They are highly creative, intelligent, insightful, confident, get lots of INFJ coochie, and are the epicest of gamers. ENTPs are not a force to be reckoned with. With their Ti, they come up with the most rational of arguments, and with their Ne, they channel their creativity into defeating their opponents.\n\nEven the least intelligent xNTx still is infinitely cooler than all the other types. ENTJs are epic capitalist chads who will never pass up an opportunity to exploit their workers. ENTJs are very productive, working 69 hours a day and are highly strategic. ENTJs dominate every situation, and are incredibly skilled commanders. The mere presence of an ENTJ alone is enough to destroy every feeler in existence.\n\nFinally, to address the elephant in the room, INTJs are true masterminds, being able to manipulate every situation. Moving through life as it were a chessboard, INTJs outsmart all of their opponents. INTJs don't bother with menial distractions like gossip and small talk \u2013 instead, they occupy themselves with highbrow entertainment such as Rick and Morty (to be fair, you have to have a high IQ to understand it). INTJs are highly analytical, and are physically incapable of having feelings. Confident and decisive, they are truly ascended individuals.\n\nAs an INTJ mastermind, I may not be conventionally attractive, but I can analyze your weaknesses and take you down. Right now, I am planning to DDOS your entire network, so you better prepare for the storm. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.\n\nYou're fucking dead, sensor."

What other harms may exist?\n\nBy eating the animal yourself you likely deny another animal a meal. This would be acceptable if you were starving in a survival situation but in modern life it is an unnecessary harm. \n\nAside from that, there are also some psychological factors to consider: by eating this animal, are you wearing down your own resolve to remain vegan? If someone else saw you eating this animal and they knew you were a vegan, would they think you a hypocrite? Maybe they would be less likely to go vegan themselves as a result.\n\nEdit: typos",

Having played CK before, I know how difficult Paradox games are, you can play hours and still not get everything. I got stuck in my first game on the third easiest difficulty, couldn\u2018t win anymore, because I was too busy learning and understanding that I was so far behind the AI (although not last, but still) in terms of points. So I decided to make a new save on a map with no other AI empires to focus on actually learning this game, also took the L-Gates out, because they gave me trouble in that save as well. Was an ironmade save, and I unlocked a lot of achievements, however, I never got some of them? Mainly the Stargate one (Imperial Highways, I had like 6 stargates at the end), but also the one for building the sentry station (build other megastructures, got the achievement for them tho), the one where you have to have an intel level of 100 on 5 vassals (which I had, I realised it\u2018s kinda fun to enlighten AI empires and keep them as my vassals, with a strict no expanding policy, so I can learn diplomacy options in peace without them fucking everything up for now), and the Patron one (where you support the artisan troupe, I supported them for roughly 50 years now, still no achievement somehow?).\nI didn\u2018t use any mods, other achievements triggered, and I use the latest Steam version with all DLCs except the latest two.\nShould I just create a new save and hope those trigger? As I still feel like I haven\u2018t fully gotten the game, I\u2018d prefer without AI, but now I\u2018m worried them not triggering with no AI empires from the start? Like I was 40 hours into the game when I realised that jobs are a thing, that you can move citizen to another colony and how to warp jump \ud83d\udc80"

It does not matter whether you are using an emulator or not; the error happens on both Nox and BlueStacks.  It does not seem to be connected to Google Play data in any way, nor does it seem to matter if you have played the original game before.  Having the old game and/or data does seem to result in a different error, but can be resolved by deleting the original.\n\nAside from that, there does not appear to be any pattern in who gets the error vs who doesn't.  I've wondered if those who can't connect simply cannot access the server at all instead of being refused or blocked by it, or if there is a difference in the time elapsed before getting the error.  For me, the error happens within five seconds on either emulator.  I've had connection errors with the original game before, and on a proper android tablet, but it always took longer before getting an error or a timeout.  And I cannot test this on that tablet now, as helpful as that would be, because the tablet bricked itself several years back.",

I'll try to remember that in the future if it ever does become an issue.\n\nAs for DownThemAll, the one feature I need that the older version has but the newer version does not is the ability to automatically capture even obscure download links.  This is something that none of the other options could do, or if they could, did so poorly.  A multipart download manager is worthless to me if I have no way of giving it the correct download link.  And believe me, I've tried.\n\nBut even if I was given a webextension that could do this, I would still prefer keeping DownThemAll because of how well integrated it is.  I do not have to go out of my way to access it.  The second I click on a download link, I automatically have the option of using DTA to download it using whatever defaults I've already set.\n\nFrankly, the functionality is so good it should have been integrated into Firefox by default.\n\nAnd I know I've yet to mention any of the other features DTA was famous for, but frankly, that's because I took them for granted.  I never had much need for it to be able to comb through a webpage and list absolutely every last thing available for download, or filter that list according to specific criteria.  I never had much need for scheduled downloads or the ability to stop and start them.  (Although that last one would have been nice, but whether that worked depended more on the other end than DTA.)  I just needed a multipart download manager that could speed up especially large downloads that I didn't need to fight to point at the correct target.\n\nAs for that bug, sorry, but I've yet to have that using xiaoxiao's loader.  Using either method for that matter.  My issue has always been getting the dang thing to work initially.  Turns out if you don't set certain things in about:config yourself, nothing that forcibly sets and locks those prefs will matter.  Just gets in the way of troubleshooting.  And I STILL couldn't get Firefox itself to load the DTA addon by dragging it into the window or even by pointing it at the xpi.  I had to manually plop it into the extension folder myself.  No idea why, but at least it will load from there.  But the bootloader.xpi that came before that?  No issues at all.\n\nAnyway, if you do decide to pick this up as a hobby project, I sincerely wish you luck.  DTA's own author threw a fit over having to port this thing, and I'm not entirely sure I blame him.",

Like prom was fun-ish, but it wasn\u2019t super crazy fun and I feel like I should be more upset by that. I mean, my parents were so excited to talk to me about prom but like I really just didn\u2019t find it all that interesting? I go to a really small school, and don\u2019t like 99.9% of the kids that go there, so being trapped in a room with them, with only crappy food and my phone to keep me company was sorta lame tbh. I mean I had a great time meeting new people and talking with old friends, but I def didn\u2019t care SM abt the prom aspect itself ykwim? Also I\u2019m so excited to be off to college that everything else just seems sort of like a \u201cmeh\u201d moment. Am I just crazy or is this normal"

                "body": "Okay so let\u2019s start with Kageyama\u2019s childhood and his passion for volleyball. Here I\u2019m going to be referring to mostly chapter 387 of the Haikyuu Manga :) and I would highly suggest you read it before reading this thread. \n\nbasically we see that even from the beginning his life started w volleyball. everyone in his main support system (his older sister and his grandfather) loved and were very passionate about the sport & when we\u2019re younger we tend to imitate and copy the ppl we look up to, so ofc it makes sense that he got super involved w it. unfortunately as time passes we first see his sister quit volleyball, even though previously she was one of the main ppl encouraging and egging on his passion and love for volleyball. And as time progresses there is this one panel where we see him playing a game against another team in elementary school, where his grandfather notices that he stopped playing at his full potential and started messing up on purpose. when asked why kageyama did this he responds with \u201cI didn\u2019t want to stop. I wanted the game to last longer.\u201d Then his grandfather says \u201cY\u2019know Tobio, if you get really, reeaallyy good, you\u2019ll get to play lots more games. The best players get to play lots of volleyball.\u201d Then he says something SUPER IMPORTANT \u201cIf you get really good, I PROMISE you, somebody who\u2019s EVEN BETTER will come and find you.\u201d Then we see Kageyama super excited abt this. Then we see another panel where Kags is explaining his teammates on his middle school team and his grandfather says \u201cthey are your teammates but they are also your rivals\u201d and kageyama gets super excited wjen he mentions the word \u201crivals.\u201d Basically the take away from this would be that Kageyama, ever since he was little has thought of a rival as something positive and something related to his love for volleyball. We can also conclude that his rival will be someone important to him, someone that represents his love and passion for volleyball. Now that we\u2019ve established his relationshp w his rival we can also look more into depth w/ his childhood and his relationship w volleyball and other people. As time progresses we see everyone who shares the same passion for volleyball as he does disappear from his life. First we see Oikawa and Izwazumi graduate and then we see his grandfather pass away. This is when we see Kageyama\u2019s attitude towards volleyball switch from wanting to enjoy volleyball w/ other people to thinking of volleyball as more as a solo sport. [End of Part 1]\n\nOkay so for my analysis on Hinata I\u2019m not rlly going to be referencing the manga, simply because I think that the anime already explains it pretty well. As we can clearly see, throughout both the anime and manga, Hinata\u2019s height is truly one of his biggest insecurities. It\u2019s the biggest challenge, and hardest roadblock he needs to overcome, & his personality shows us that he is someone who feels the need to face his insecurities/roadblocks head on. Someone who finds that overcoming a roadblock is something he enjoys. I can truly relate to Hinata in that aspect, because for me I loved doing gymnastics simply because I loved to prove that even though I had weak wrists and ankles I could still do well in that sport. Especially in the athletic sense, defying the norm and other people\u2019s expectations is one of the best and most satisfying feelings possible. For me, this moment was when I finally got my back handspring which I had been struggling with for months. For Hinata this moment was when he saw the Little Giant preforming on the TV at nationals, in both moments there was the satisfying proof that what might be considered a handicap to other people in a sport, still couldn\u2019t stop you from being the best. As a character seeing someone who shared the same handicap as he did (his height) still proving himself in a sport where that specific handicap was considered to be one of the biggest and hardest to overcome handicaps was monumental to Hinata. Especially when you\u2019re younger, seeing someone who\u2019s similar to you defy the norm is hugely impactful. I think that this moment of \u201cif-he-can-do-it-so-can-i\u201d was when Hinata truly became obsessed and passionate about volleyball. The Little Giant had become his idol and he became determined to follow in his footsteps. In the same way that Kageyama had no one to share his passion of volleyball with, Hinata had no one that loved volleyball as much as he did. Of course being the amazing dere-dere character he is, Hinata only worked to improve even though he was alone in his passion. So while both Kageyama and Hinata had teams and other people to play with, they both felt mostly alone in their passion for the sport. [End of part 2]"

It is also used for terms of politeness when talking to a person older than you and you want to show them respect, like a more formal way of speaking. This is a use of the 2nd plural form in general. Be careful how you use this, and do not use it with people around your age and a bit older (sometimes even 10 years difference is ok)... greeks are mostly chill so they might find it weird and too formal. In these situation you gotta estimate the vibe and choose during the conversation.

Many, many possibilities.\n* Also I like chemistry a lot and you can choose to follow the path of that field  from this school if you want.\n\nIn general it has many potential with the main \"subfields\" being: chemistry, materials, energy and environment and economics. \n\nAlso you should know that usually an engineering study field has the main purpose of teaching you how to solve problems instead of teaching you how to study well. Of course they teach you that too, but it's not their main goal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I'm still studying so this is the impression I got from my experience. It may chande from country to country.",

I watched the scene where Harry decides to spare the life to Peter Pettiqrew. So I thought: he has already tried to escape and they know that he can turn into a rat so why the hell would they capture him just with ropes?or whatever they used to tie him up. He would definitely try to escape again. They could have probably thought of that instead of making these decisions so quickly. An easy way to deal with that could have been the \"Petrificus Totalus\" spell. We have already seen Hermione using that spell on Neville so why would she hesitate with the man responsible for those horrible deeds? \nAnd I've thought about the fact that they didn't think of that: We all know that Harry and Sirius aren't the smartest people on earth. Ron's intelligence is....questionable.... But Lupin is considered to be smart and a good wizard as well, he used to be a good student etc. However since we haven't seen him in a scene that fully uncovers his mind potential, his cleverness can't  be fully judged. But for Hermione we have enough proof to determine that she is not stupid. So HOW the hell couldn't she think that taking Pettigrew to the castle while he is totally conscious and poorly retained would be TOO risky? She has great understanding of the case and how important it is but she just doesn't think that a person who can turn into a rat can escape easily from almost anywhere?\nYeah brilliant let's take Wormtail in the castle with all those dementors looking for the man we are trying to prove is innocent with no protection at all....on a fullmoon....with the werewolf teacher,a teacher a bit behind us that hates all 5 of us and the minister who is desperate to find our fugitive friend wandering in the castle with Dumbledore, the only one who would actually defend our purpose.\nBut of course JK Rowling....Harry couldnt have a happily ever after with a family that was at least chosen by his parents....\nIn conclusion I feel like the characters in Harry Potter are clever only when it is needed for the story, which happens in almost every book or movie but it's still a bit irritating.\nAlso sorry for any possible mistake I made I am not a native speaker."

Problem is just a lack of empathy and emotional understanding I\u2018d say, which can make the friendship a bit frustrating sometimes. Otherwise you\u2018re right, the drinking thing is a serious issue, but whenever I try talking to him about it, he brushes it off with just thinking it\u2018s funny to be drunk, and that it\u2018s not a big deal. Unfortunately it\u2018s not uncommon in germany to drink in school and his classmate/friend is indeed an alcoholic, so not the best influence. Anyway I\u2018ll try setting more boundaries and what bothers me, even tho it will be hell :,)",

So yea I will try talking to him after today, because he\u2018s not been answering my messages in 6 hours and I\u2018m kinda very worried.\n\nAnd yea you\u2018re right. Just feels like whenever I wanna set a boundary, it makes me a bad friend. I really wish I was more social, and spend much time, but it exhausts me. I know it\u2018s fine to be like that, and that my own comfort should come first, but in the end I still feel guilty. I\u2018m gonna try being more honest about my feelings. \n\nThanks for the reply!",

Then you ask her out and she says no and then (based on another comment) your friendship is over... obviously because you didn't like her enough as a person to keep her around. This is already enough to make YTA in my opinion.\n\nFrom there;\na) You assume you \"get\" the friend group\nb) To do this, you exclude her\nc) You don't communicate anything to her you just complain to your mutual friends and have them basically tell her everything and do your dirty work for you (yk, the way middle schoolers have their friends break up with their gf's for them)\nd) Lastly, you don't consider that maybe she's hanging around you so much to try to reassure you that you're still friends\n\nAnd this aspect is more of a personal \"thought\" or \"statement\" whatever you may call it, you have liked since college, so for years on end. You then ask her out she says no and after a few weeks you've already been talking to another girl long enough to invite her to meet your friends. You didn't like or have a \"crush\" on Julie. You saw her as an opportunity. An available and presumably attractive **girl,** not friend or even person, which can be seen in a comment where OP states that he \"doesn't want any more female friends his age\"\n\nin conclusion, YTA.",

There is certainly some truth in that claim, but I feel like it\u2019s been taken too far and viewed as an absolute truth. Constantly hearing that you have to spend $600 on shit before you can even go camping overnight is a huge barrier to many newcomers\u2014like myself. It dissuades people from even attempting to go out, which is the whole point of checking out these sites and subreddits. \n\nSo, I refer back to the title; what cheap gear (newly bought or secondhand) do you love, despite all of the people who\u2019ve told you that an upgrade is necessary? One of mine is a 12x12 rainproof tarp I got at a thrift store for $10. It\u2019s held up over dozens of audden middle-of-the-night rainstorms for the last three years. Another is a bunch of $5 headlamps from (I think) Harbor Freight. Not the brightest in the world, but $25  has supplied my whole camp with a half-decent light for 2 years, rather than spending $100 to get one pretty good light on one person. And most of my cookware was second-hand thrift stuff that only took a few hours in the oven and some oil to freshen up. \n\nOf course there\u2019s some janky shit that I own, my point is just that you don\u2019t have to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars to go have some fun in the woods. I think it\u2019s important to remind each other of that, whether newcomers or veterans."

Needless to say, I\u2019m a bit confused. Some people swear by its great flavor in sauces or stuffed into birds, Wikipedia does not. \n\nAnyone have some experience or sources that can clarify a little more? Is it only toxic in large quantities? Are the leaves okay, and other parts of the plant toxic? Does it have to be cooked to a certain temperature? Anything is appreciated.

I have made an exception list that includes food (duh), hygiene & cleaning products, refills like printer cartridges or air purifier filters, and some small hardware stuff like nails and studs for DIY purposes.\n\nSo far in my 2 weeks I have realized the following:\n\n* Stores are full of things for solutions that you don't even need fixed. 80% of stuff is crap... It's all there for impulse buys and it has made me be more conscious of it. \n\n* It has made me live more in the present. Before I would wait for the next Amazon package, or the new smartphone to get excited to and then eventually the novelty wears off. Rinse & Repeat. Now I feel like doing things more such as hanging out with friends, cooking, or exercising. \n\n* I feel I have less hesitation on spending money on experiences. Like I don't feel as guilty on traveling or getting drinks at a bar because what else am I spending on?\n\n* I have so much shit in my house that I forget to use... there are unopened gifts, double sided tape that I bought a long time ago, unfinished puzzles... It has made me want to reanalyze what I have and either give it away or not take it for granted. \n\n* Thrift shops and online marketplace have some really nice stuff. Now I already knew this beforehand but it has made me excited for shopping again. Why buy shirts from h&m or marshalls that's only going to last you a year when you can buy a used LL Bean flannel that's of great quality. IMO secondhand is superior because things in there have stood the test of time. \n\n* And last but not least, this change hasn't been much of a challenge and I think most people can do it! Granted the exception list helps... I wanted this challenge to be achievable after all. It has only been 2 weeks but I don't see myself running into any issue this months, and I can definitely see myself doing it for the whole year. It has changed my mentality on what's necessary in life and I hope I can continue on..."

My dad learned about systemic racism from talking to black activists in Philly back in the 70s, some of which were MOVE members. So while I believe the claims that doesn't change what initially they were fighting for. \n\n\nSimilar to how I felt when there were rumors of MLK Jr. being abusive/womanizer/encouraging a rape. It's entirely possible that could have happened, or it could be slander against him from the FBI. Who knows. But what I do know is the message they fought for.

Then probably condensing countries down considering half of the population just got wiped out. Restructuring borders, some dissolving. Possible conflict? But unlikely. Then putting lots of effort into genetic engineering in order to enable repopulation although that would probably mean we will never get a male population back. You said men so possibly trans women would still exist, so we could always rely on synthesis of their sperm if they would allow it. But if it's Y chromosome dependent then some female humans would also disappear who have genetic abnormalities. It's really down to how exactly it would take place. Overall I think we would survive, but we'd all be sad about it for a couple generations until no person alive had even met a male human",

It sounds to me that your parents are simply neglectful, which has nothing to do with poly. That's just the thing they're focused on. Would you blame alcohol if they were obsessed with going out and partying? Or if they were obsessed with traveling? I've seen the dynamic of mono parents going on vacations twice a year without their children and only taking their kids on vacations maybe once a year or every other year. They simply just don't want to spend time with their kids all the time so they send them to stay with friends or family for 2-4 months out of every year. Has nothing to do with whatever they're obsessed with, has everything to do with them as people. \n\nAlso, I want to ask why your dad gets a pass for not taking you to Canada simply because he doesn't want to, but not your mom?

                "body": "So, I (25F) have 3 committed partners and 1 casual. I(28M) lives far away and we mostly have a ldr now, which I'm content with because I love and care for him and am just happy to be apart of his life in whatever way we can. A(26M) is my casual partner and we have a very lax and chill relationship. We don't get to see each other often as we're both busy and he's often traveling. B(24M) is my husband and we're doing great, no problems on his front. \n\nBut my partner C(30M) is struggling to find a comfortable place within our relationship. He's a monogamous person, but was interested in trying polyamory so we're giving it a shot. None of my partners are in relationships with each other, but I&B are friends, A has talked to both and has an interest in meeting both should the occassion arise. C on the other hand has met I&A, but refuses to meet B because hes aware of the way B has behaved in the past and some of the issues B and I are still working through. B has made a ton of progress as a person and is trying to be a better person, but C has made up his mind that he wants nothing to do with B because as he says it \"I don't have to be around abusive people if I don't want to be\" which is fair, but I don't want to have parallel relationships. Which is something I told him in the beginning when we went over boundaries. C also is setting boundaries that I feel are in conflict with what I had established in the beginning of our relationship. He says he needs alone time with me and that it's very important to him, which I understand and respect. However, I am in school and working 4 days a week and I have a child. So I don't have a lot of free time, which he knows. So the times, usually once a week, we spend together he wants to be alone time. Which sometimes I can and do meet, other times however I decide to bring my son along. Which upsets him, because a) usually, we don't get alone time until my son's asleep b) sometimes I fall asleep too so we don't get alone time at all because I'm exhausted c) I usually don't know for sure if I'll bring my son until the day of/before I head out to see him which he says bothers him. But I've also tried to plan in advance to bring my son but he still says he'd prefer if I don't. Which I find offensive, because it's my son for crissake. Even if it would make more sense and be the easier solution, he still would prefer if I don't. \n\nHe's also had issues in the past with even being around my other partners outside of B. He was upset when A called me babe over text, but it was just an emotional reaction.  He was upset and uncomfortable being around I because he felt like our relationship was diminished or made not unique because I'd also hold I's hand. Which I thought runs counter to my desires for kitchen table. It all came to a head on my birthday. The weekend before my birthday, I decided to go hangout with one of my friends at her new house and celebrate my birthday and her house buying! I invited C first, since he was there when I made the plans. Then, a little bit later, A texted me and asked if I'd like to hangout. I said yes and asked C if he'd mind if A came along. C said \"if you wanna go with him that's fine\" and I was thrown off. I asked him to explain why he would say that and he basically said, \"well when you asked me i thought it was going to be a more intimate experience, like it was gonna be like a date with me and you hanging out with your friends.\" But like, it was my birthday celebration? And I brought up my feelings to him and told him it kind of upsets me that he's taking my birthday celebration and making it about him. Which he decided okay let's try bringing A. But at that point I was already turned off from the idea because I didn't want to deal with a blow up/fighting AT my birthday celebration. It was supposed to be a fun thing, but was quickly being soured. \n\nC has also stated it makes him uncomfortable to talk to me on the phone when I'm around B, but he also says he doesn't like it when I'm upset with him and won't talk to him about it. But the only time that's happened is when I'm with B and I don't feel like it's my job to go out of my way and leave B behind to go talk to C about what he did to make me feel sad/hurt. I feel like it's something that I should be left to talk about when I have time and energy to deal with it. I don't ignore him, but I'm unenthused and just kinda meh, especially if it really hurt. He says it triggers him to panic and get anxiety, so I should care more about that and just drop whatever I'm doing to talk to him about what HE did to hurt me immediately even if B and I are in the middle of caring for our son. Because he's too uncomfortable to talk when I'm around B. I told him I feel like all 3 of those requirements are in conflict and seriously inconsiderate to me and my feelings, considering I'm the one who is hurt. \n\n\nIdk if any of this makes sense, but honestly I can't tell if I'm the problem here and expecting too much of him or if he's maybe not a good fit for what I'm offering/looking for right now. I feel like I cannot provide the time/energy he needs and I feel like he doesn't take into consideration all that I have to do on a daily basis and the amount of time I do make for him doesn't seem to translate well. I do have the habit of being on my phone a lot when I'm stressed and so I've made an effort VERY recently to avoid that and try to just put it down and only answer if necessary. So perhaps that's causing him to be unhappy with the time we do have together? Idk any thoughts would be super helpful."

Just scroll on!\" Falls into play. I often use the same arguement on them, but they then turn around and say it's somehow different and that \"you're being down voted hard so just take the L\". As if a sub dominated by abusive/toxic people that take joy in mocking the plight and pain of marginalized group would do anything else. When I point out that if they posted the same meme in the groups they are talking about(i.e. women dominated subs) they wouldn't get the same results, they brush the point off and continue trying to claim I'm just trolling while ignoring the fact that I just reflected the arguement style being presented to me. They take more issue with me doing it than they do with the fact that they never actually acknowledged my issues, just jumped straight into devaluing and diverting from my actual arguement. Does anybody else see this regularly whenever they give their opinions/perspective in mostly male dominated areas? \n\n [screenshots of comments](http://imgur.com/a/FvhWQsF)"

It even asked for the inquiry code. Overall it seemed pretty legit as I went through the list with the automated voice.\n\nBut once I got to speaking to a person, something felt off. They sounded hesitant, passed me around to different people and kept inquiring for my phone number, which they should already have. They also asked for my postal code and the make of my mobile phone. \n\nI decided to quietly google the number directly, and found absolutely no information on it whatsoever. I searched the exact same prompt as I had before into Google and found the same page (vodafone.com.au/shop_now on Google) this time displaying a different number.\n\nMy gut told me not to trust them, so I refused to tell them my postal code and during a hold tone, I put down the call. \n\nI later then called up 1555 which is the number I was probably supposed to call in the first place and the guy on the other end had access to all my phone info and didn't ask many questions at all, just answered mine.

The major problem, however, is neither of us have a car, and most of the sofas we\u2019ve found for cheap or free that we like are far away in distant suburbs. We are both not from Melbourne, and, though I have a Victorian driver\u2019s licence, I\u2019ve never driven in Australia and I\u2019m not confident enough to do so - especially if I must drive a van. We\u2019re afraid that the cost of requesting help to transport a sofa from somewhere ~10km+ away from us using Airtasker or uber or would far exceed our budget.\n\nSo far we have bought the furniture and utensils we have from Kmart, and a little from ikea. But we either had to physically lug them home on the tram with sheer force of will, pay $50 for ikea delivery or rely on Airtasker. \n\nAny advice on how and where to affordably get and transport a sofa using those methods above would be super appreciated!"

I knew that ever since i was younger, i have a deep fascination with music and now that i'm older, i want to try building a career out of it. Many of my peers told me to go for it, yet my parents would always try to discourage me from pursuing it. Be it from trying to get into auditions or even posting short videos online. Sometimes they would even resort to putting me down, basically bullying me to reconsider and saying that i only do this 'stuffs' because i wanted fame. Repeatedly they said that i'm much better at studying anyway and because of that, i feel like i need to get their validation throughout my life and i feel miserable, trapped and worthless. Many times i wanted to stop thinking that i need their validation to build my life but many times i remember the plain disappointment clear on their faces and i just stopped because i loved them too much to put myself first. Even now, i'm still looking up to them, asking for permission and hoping that in a way, i could still make them happy. Slowly i began to rebel against their 'love', while at the same time still looking out for them. Slowly i spend more for myself, keeping silent when they berated me for spending 'too' much on myself but keeping my ears deaf so that their words can't hurt me and lessen the love i have for them. \n\nI understand that they care... and they're worried for me and my future. But i won't know if i'm going to succeed if i didn't try. And hopefully, when it all ends, i would still be by their side and maybe, this time, i'll make you infinitely proud of me."

I already have a plan (that has already somewhat been put into effect) to curse him by having him enter into an agreement with an unknown power (who will turn out to be the Raven Queen). I was thinking about different benefits that she could offer him, and I would really like to do something that helps his rolls. I was thinking that either (a), he would have a certain number of charges per day to essentially gie himself advantage on atack rolls, or (b), give him a certain number of charges per day to give himself a +#, which would scale upwards as he continues his pact with the Raven Queen. I am obviously going to give something of equal power to the other player (I only have two players). What do you all think about this? Do you guys have any ideas?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I should probably also note that it's not an issue with the dice he's using. He's gotten three sets of dice now, and he consistently rolls ones and twos. I definitely bluff and let things hit when they shouldn't sometimes, but not with ones and twos."

I hear Waterfox was bought out and doesn\u2019t update fast enough causing for concern with security. \n\nSo is it even worth it to use Waterfox over Firefox, considering I\u2019m probably going to configure Firefox to be more private and secure anyways? (However, the Waterfox icon looks nicer than Firefox lol)"

For the sake of argument, let's grant them this. Does it follow that existence is not a state of affairs? Prima facie, the distinction between an existential property and an existential fact seems unproblematic to me.\n\nI ask because I am concerned with arguing for a grounding relation between the existence of objects. For example, one might argue that the fact that I exist is grounded in the fact that my parents exist (or existed). As far as I can tell, those facts about the existence of me and my parents obtain even when existence is not a property instantiated in any of us. And there are other examples of asymmetric irreflexive non-causal explanation between existential facts.  However, I don't work in contemporary metaphysics, so perhaps I'm off base.\n\nI've already read the SEP article on Ontological Dependence but any other references would be welcome."

So since the sorcerer doesn\u2019t have an official gish option, but has alot of potential because of quickened spell, I was wondering if giving a Sorcerer the same abilities as a Wizard, would it break the game? \n\nGoing with Dex and Cha as primary stats, at level 6 I\u2019d be able to make 2 weapon attacks and cast a spell in the same turn. This seems\u2026 really strong. Of course it\u2019s limited by both spell slots and sorcery points. \n\nMaybe even throwing in a few levels of Warlock will make it even crazier? \n\nI am really unsure if this could be a fun way to combine meta-magic with sword-play.\nOr if it will be an un-balanced mess."

I've been spending time with my family, and I've been engaging in hobbies that I used to feel nothing but apathy towards. Supporting my wife with the focus that I've been unable to sustain with drinking and smoking. Feeling a renewed sense of purpose, and honestly, loving basically every second of it. I finally feel like I love my life again. After years of running away from myself and my problems, either through smoking weed or binge drinking, I actually love being sober. I love feeling what's going on inside my emotional world, because it's all pretty beautiful, man. I feel hopeful about my future, when all I would see were the obstacles ahead of me before. I know that I can tackle them as I come across them, because sober me is more than capable. This is an amazing feeling, and it required absolutely zero substances.

This is how some people can grieve, and still hold the wrong belief. I notice that there's a point. I see outside myself in this process. Where you can accept your fault in it. That pain is self inflicted, but it teaches me. I think it would be easy to never accept it. To place the blame in whoever you're experiencing the grief as a result of. \n\nI don't understand why people do the latter. A fragile ego doesn't seem like justification enough to ignore such a fraction of reality. Perhaps I'm giving people too much credit, but I don't see it as such. A knowledge of yourself should be so easy to see. What creates this struggle in people? Is it just pain? Ego defenses? Thick skin, built upon itself. Like an armadillo after a while?

                "body": "I've had this happen today when I was trying to complete my work orientation. Today, I was to obtain a binder containing all the information I needed to know before I started work, and the badge I would be using for work. \n\nThe employer had sent me a form that I had to fill out so that they can process the badge and confirm my legal name matches my ID (I am trans; my deadname is my legal name).\n\n\n*\"So far, so good. Everything makes sense so far\", I think.*\n\n\nThis morning, I sent her an email to confirm if I would be obtaining the form and the binder at the designated location. She tells me that she will email the form instead and that she needs my employee number.\n\n\n*\"Okay, no problem. Yes, it irritates me a change had to be done so suddenly, but it's not terrible.\"*\n\n\nAnd then, the employer tells me later that I did not send her the employee number, despite the fact that I put it in the first line of the email I sent her yesterday, after the email that had the form attached to it. And because of this, she couldn't have sent this application yet.\n\n\n**This is the part where I was starting to get agitated and upset.**\n\n\nI go to the location and obtain the binder with no issues. Then I start heading over to the badge office. When I get there, I tell the people who work there my employee number, and who my employer was. I was thinking that she should have sent that document yesterday, but it's okay. Maybe the email with the filled form will register in their system by the time I get there.\n\n\n\n***WRONG.***\n\n\n\nI go to the counter at the badge office and I tell the people that my application should have been emailed, and they tell me no records are to be found. I told them I would wait a bit because the email might take a while to register in the system. Hour and a half later, and after exchanging more emails with my employer, I realised that the email with the form was not going to process today. I would have to come back to the badge office at a later date, and I would have to call the badge office before coming in to make sure my employee status registers in the system. This was all after nearly 2 weeks of delays due to constant non-communication from my employer, despite continued emails to her.\n\n\n*And the best part of it all?*\n\n\nI COULD HAVE SAVED MYSELF THAT HOUR AND A HALF IF SHE BOTHERED TO WRITE 6 WORDS ON YESTERDAY'S EMAIL REGARDING THE BADGE:\n\n*\"The badge takes days to process.\"*\n\nSometimes, I feel that NT people can \"fill in gaps\" that to me, as someone who is ND, cannot bridge. To me, this entire endeavour was highly confusing, and this issue could have been prevented if my employer communicated better, as I could not \"fill in the gaps\". I even told her I have Aspergers and she still didn't make an effort to communicate with as little ambiguity as possible. She told me this process as if I had already done it a few dozen times. I haven't. This is my first time. The ambiguity was bothering me so much and overloading my brain.\n\n**TL;DR - My employer gave me the expectation that my badge would be ready today, but due to miscommunication, I have to go back there another day and I wasted an hour and a half of my time.**\n\nHas anyone else here had a similarly frustrating experience?"

However, I can't seem to find out what middle name I want to have. I want to change my name so I can leave all the pain and trauma associated with my family, and because I personally find my deadname a bother to write and say.\n\nI've been thinking of Matilda, Brynn, Michelle, and I'm looking for one that sounds strong, feminine, and elegant (strong is more preferred than the other two). I'm especially looking for middle names that go well with Jeanne and have a feel of a strong woman/girlboss. They don't necessarily have to be French. I'm just looking for ones that are not Korean (since that's past of my family history that I wish to leave behind).\n\nI am mostly Hispanic and partly European (mostly Spanish and British), if that may give an idea of a name that would fit me well, culturally-speaking.\n\nAny other suggestions I haven't mentioned here are also welcome!

Like, the art style to not be so over the top, the voice acting to be kinda normal, the story to be, at least good and to not have the same tropes like the other series....\n\nI am very picky regarding this theme so, these are some animated shows i really liked for various reasons: 90's Berserk, Arcane, the Witcher: nightmare of the Wolf, Oban: the stelar races (i believed it's called) and the OG Teen Titans. \n\nI hope i won't get banned or the mods delete the post, like the last time I tried to post something. \n\nTIA"

The main problem is: if i try to get a more in depth explanation of a certain function, i need to dig up on shady Chinese sites to, hopefully, find another explanation besides (for example: FMath::Clamp(<args>)) \"clamps a variable\", which, for a noob like me, doesn't say anything useful, like what's it's use case or why should I consider using it. \n\nI know that, for an experienced programmer, the template for a function is helpful enough, but for someone who's trying to learn, it's really painful to not find, at least, a good definition, let alone an example or a list of use cases. \n\nSo the question will be: where can I find good documentation for UE? \n\nThe next problem is about exporting from blender to unreal, which seems to break at some point. I tried to export a model as an .fbx and, after some digging, was related to the normals not being calculatedd properly in Blender. Tried again after recalculating the normals, export with the same extension, same result. This time, i completely redesigned the model, parented everything, i made sure the normals are on point and tried to export it using the .obj extension. This time, roughly half of the model did not show. Thought it was because of the normals, again, or unapplied modifiers, but the only modifier i had was a mirror modifier, which was showing. \n\nDo you have any ideas what is causing this and how can I fix it? \n\nSorry about the vague details and the ranty tone. I'm trying my best to not waste your time with details. Thanks in advance!"

                "body": "Look outside. It's been so beautiful these past few weeks hasnt it? Ominous? Sure, but beautiful. I remember my mom telling me stories from the world over. I especially loved Norse myths, how very silly it all seemed. Like, Loki turned himself into a female horse to have an 6 legged deer? Pfft, okay. All of them seemed silly, except for the norse \"end of the world\" story, Ragnarok, and the 3 year long snow bringing winter that came with it, Fimbulwinter.\n\nIt's a myth of course. Ragnarok and fimbulwinter, ghost, ghoulies and all manner of hob-whatevers. Still, it seems funny to think about considering the current situation, how that would be preferable to this. \n\nHello, and sorry for the delayed greetings. I'm Lavan. I'm sure you're just as terrified and confused as I am, and I'd like to help you with some rules I've found that add some order and levity to our lives. \n\n1. If you can see the snow, and aren't inside your basement or somewhere windowless, that means this list is for you. All the others are relatively safe for now. If that is discomforting, please know that we share a unique experience in the world, and it's possible that we're the last/only people to ever experience this. \n\n2. Drink out of your tap water. Dont bother with the stored water you have in your bathtub. They were all wrong, and I'm pretty sure it was just to comfort us, and hope we died fast enough so we wouldn't feel too much pain. \n\n3. Call your friends and family. If the phone lines still work where you live, it's always good to keep in touch. If your friends and family arent with you in the place you live, and you hear or see them in person, ignore it. They're just hallucinations. It's a comforting truth, not common these days. \n\n4. Read any books you can find. Where I live, all the electronics were immediately fried along with the power grid, so I began reading up everything I could around me. No use reading the same book twice in my experience, pages get stained and sticky by the time I'm done with one read-through. Currently reading my snowblower manual. Oh yeah, it's a real page turner, trust me. Also the irony is not lost on me. \n\n5. Keep a mirror somewhere nearby, but facedown. No, this is not because spooky monsters are going to come and eat your soul, I just dont want you to freak yourself out over what you see. Learned that the hard way. Still, keep the mirror around so you can check up on yourself, and keep yourself sane. Apparently seeing your own reflection helps you affirm your place in the world, or something to that tune. \n\n6. Ignore the trail of hair strands all over your house. I'd love to tell you it's from the ring girl, who has become your new roommate in these lonesome nights and days (if we still even have those), it's not. You're just growing in and shedding out a lot faster. Just sweep it all to one corner, and try to stay away from said corner.\n\n7. If you notice any bleeding, stray pieces of skins or flesh scattered about the house, dont freak out, it's a good sign. It means you're one of the luckier ones. If you only noticed by seeing it on the ground, that means you didnt feel the pain of your body rotting and decaying off of you which is again, good.  \n\nThey always told me it wouldnt happen in my lifetime. That my generation would fix it all, that it wouldnt ever come to anything like this. But here we are, the old and rich huddled in their little concrete lead-lined shelters, the poor stuck outside, the poorer among them still alive, and the poorest thinking they still have a chance at a world beyond the storm.\n\nI'm sorry for the melodramatic ranting, it's just... it's just been a while since I've gotten a signal. I got this phone from going outside on a supply run. Fell into the snow layer, and while fighting my way up, I found this dug deep in the snow. Got home, and started writing. I dont know how many years that little face plant of mine took off my lifespan, but probably not an insignificant number, considering the constant nosebleeds (hope it's my nose anyways) and auditory hallucinations. I'm sure I'm getting to my end of the line, so I've decided to sit by this window, and look at the snowfall outside. I remember the EAS on TV, morning of... December 12th I think? I remember the anchor telling us the fallout should stop in a few weeks, that we'd be safe in our shitty little basements. I continued believing him, until half of my little brother's face sloughed off into the ground in front of him. The worst part was how awfully painless it seemed to him. He just stood there, blinking with one eye, and his other one just barely hanging out of his head by an optic nerve. \n\nRagnarok came and went, and fimbulwinter continues. \n\nThank you for keeping me company. It helps to think that someone else knows, that someone else is going through the same thing, and will eventually die the same way I will. Maybe we'll both stay buried under the snow, maybe both of us won't be found for thousands of years, and who knows, maybe there will be someone left to find us.\n\n------------------------------END OF TRANSCRIPTION----------------------------\n\nFrom: Henderson, J\n\nTo     : Lavan, S\n\nSubject: Hey, what the fuck????\n\nDate: November 17th\n\n\n\nBody: \n\nDude what is this???

                "body": "The finals approached. Lary drowned in anxiety, but not because he needed to study. Being dumbfounded each time he entered a classroom, he relied on the small sheets of paper called cheats. Dubious teachers even came close to catching his criminal ass. But what now? There is no way to succeed in the hardest exams, so he thought. The little online store sold top-of the range answer keys. Made by seniors who later went to MIT - level colleges in Lary\u2019s eyes. The answers proved to be correct each time. Larry worked night shifts, selling his dear phone to get the last five hundred bucks for the praised answer sheet And there he stood at his flat\u2019s door, flaccid with sweating anxious anticipation. It should be delivered today before 7. If anyone caught him, or his package, he is dead meat. Three years of college, a hundred thousand dollars will flush right down the toilet along with the addition of criminal prosecution as a cherry on top. Larry leaned, fell on the door, staring through the cracked eyehole. He heard footsteps. A student he knows shouldn\u2019t be here otherwise came. Larry suppressed his nervous screaming and started to unlock the door. The student on the staircase sprinted like a terrified mouse. He was 5 feet away from Larry when he turned a little to the right. Larry\u2019s whole came to a still. The man left the box, answer sheet, along with Lary\u2019s name, on the neighbor\u2019s doormat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe neighbor tailored to make your life miserable, Mrs. Tailor, reached for the box. She was a furtive, old, and grumpy hag. As she reached down, Larry unlocked his door. Slamming it open, Larry stumbled outside of his apartment. They connected gazes, irrational student and bitter lady. Mrs Tailor furrowed the remains of her eyebrows, deciding if it was more effective to scold the young man for treating house property like this or hide from a potential drug dealer. Weren\u2019t all kids nowadays injecting marijuana? She slammed the door behind her. In a desperate state of mind, Larry banged and shouted at the neighbor\u2019s door. \u201cIt\u2019s my mail\u2026 You saw it came to me!! It\u2019s the delivery man! Mrs. Tailor, I know you\u2019re there!!!\u201d These sorry attempts only spurred the lady into action. As an ex surgeon would, she sliced the top of the box with care. \u201cWhat if it has a bomb?\u201d she thought \u201c Too late to think too much, there is a drug dealer to convict.\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCrying Larry listened. Clack, rustling, silence, and stifled gasp. He is done. That\u2019s it. The lady was too familiar with the college routine to not know. The infamous party crusher and the ex-math teacher would never let this disaster die out. Larry set down on her doormat. The familiar voice came from the other side, \u201cThis is both illegal and completely irresponsible!\u201d \u201cMmmh\u201d he mumbled in response. Her tone hardened \u201cThat is all you have? Did you want to set your fellow students at a great disadvantage? Or get it easy by lying.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026. I couldn\u2019t do it otherwise...Please don\u2019t tell anybody..\u201d She plunged into righteous anger \u201cThis is unfathomable! As a teacher, this can not be described as anything but improper! I will need to tell the authorities.\u201d Larry heard her fumbling away. When there was no way back, a decade-old dam broke in him. \u201cYou know what, lady, every time I come into that damned classroom, I don\u2019t understand shit. My parents chose the only major I hated to my gut. If you study well, you are a good child, right? What if I\u2019m dumb, and lazy, and unhappy with my sorry ass all the time? I just don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know what to do and how to be normal. Dumbass.\u201d Larry felt better. It was the first time he dropped the facade. Free, he was free to live in his failure. \u201cYou listen, boy,\u201d she responded after a few minutes of silence, \u201cWhen I first came to school, I didn\u2019t understand jackshit. Whom did I blame? Father that I didn\u2019t have, the mother that always worked, friends that couldn\u2019t put 2 and 2 together. I finished it, but see where it got me now. Low-cost student apartment, hilarious turn of events. Go now, live, never lie and most importantly, be truthful to yourself.\u201d And so did Larry live."

I guess that's just one of those instances where you accidentally end up stepping on a landmine in casual conversation, it happens to the best of us. \n\nIt's unfortunate that that question likely hit a nerve and she ended up falsely jumping to that conclusion which is fair to feel offended over, though of course as you're already aware, spamming and over explaining can definitely hit the nail on the coffin.\n\nRegardless, that isn't some horrendous mistake that you should assign guilt to, I think this is more so a learning experience on how to properly deal with false conclusions and sensitivities in others. And the block like you said was likely just to distance herself, because she probably felt disrespected and subsequently overwhelmed, and while that may sting, you're still not any kind of \"bad\" person for getting offended by her misinterpretation or for slipping up and pushing it when you did. \n\nAlso, if the relationship was already a bit frayed, would you really have preferred the likely situation in which she didn't block you but still felt bothered and distanced herself through passive messages and fizzling out the conversation regardless?\n\nStill, I'm sorry about your situation and I hope you can use this as a growth opportunity and find some other colleagues in the industry that you can connect with, I hope that you can remedy any ill feelings and get past it soon. Have a nice day!\n\nEDIT(to respond to your edit):\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by your age, but as for the feeling of rejection of your warm regards, I'm sorry about that, not all relationships flow how they should and some slip ups can end with a relationship feeling like wasted time and effort.

And this can sometimes lead to us jumping to conclusions if we feel threatened and even if we're told it was a miscommunication, sometimes it's hard to tell whether that is true or not especially if we are already on alert. \n\nSo, I think in this situation she felt the need to protect and distance herself from the perceived boundary push that she received and blocked you as a result. Just like you said, I think she felt threatened from the misunderstanding and blocked you without realizing how that would affect you. \n\nBut, knowing that there was likely no ill will on her part, try not to take the block to heart, it doesn't make you any worse of a person to fall victim to a misunderstanding and you are just as great as you were before.\n\nThere are so many people out there that you can reach out to and talk with, so maybe just try to be on the lookout for and be patient with any misinterpretations in the future and work on getting past it. \nHope this helps give you some closure, I hope you can find some more people soon!",

If you feel hurt and abandoned by someone and wish they didn't leave so abruptly like you said in the third paragraph, doesn't that mean you still want them to care? \n\nIt might be pathetic if you tried to force someone who left to come back into your life and fix whatever pain they left behind, but that isn't what you were saying. I don't think you should consider it pathetic of yourself to  simply *want* that care and consideration from them, that is a natural emotion to feel upon the loss of a friend. \n\nFrom my personal experience, if someone suddenly cuts you off, it's important to recognize that feeling of rejection and not put yourself down for the loss and attachment you feel, because that really is a painful experience.\n\nAs for the fault, based on that last sentence and the main post, if you deep down know that something wasn't truly your fault and you feel hurt when they leave then you either have the option to blame and resent them or forgive them, as gaslighting yourself won't do any good. As for if you are at fault but still feel hurt over their rejection, you can only try to apologize and improve whatever parts of you influenced that mistake. Though most of the time it is a mix of the two, because no one is perfect and we all make mistakes. But either way, you should be kind to yourself and always reach out to your loved ones who accept you to vent and get that help and affirmation you need so you can move on.\n\nI'm not sure if this addresses what you were saying, but I hope it helps, don't be too hard on yourself!",

I personally wouldn't want to be with someone like that. Too much stress and \"making sure we're even\" every time money is involved, if you get my drift.\n\nSecondly, he sounds like he's reading up on internet dating too much to be this jaded and already expecting that you're \"keeping him as a backup\" and \"she's just using me to pay for dates if she wants to wait a week\" (c'mon who the fuck is wasting that much time for a $30 snack). Personally I also see that as a red flag because he's not going into dating you with an open mind - he's expecting you to act a very specific way and otherwise assumes you're not serious. If you end up liking him, every step out of what he has pre-determined is \"expected\" behaviour you will have to justify. Again, imagine how fucking tiring it would be dating someone like that.\n\nPersonally I would just find someone else who doesn't already make you feel off about them after the first date.",

It's a personal preference and everyone is unique. THAT BEING SAID, if a guy is making big enough value judgments on you specifically based on whether or not you're a virgin to consider liking you or not, that's probably not someone you should be wanting to be with anyway romantically or sexually.\n\nI was a virgin until I was around 21 or 22 as well by choice (was waiting for the right guy), and I've also had a few serious relationships prior to that. And I can tell you literally none of them cared (nor any guy I've dated after either) about my virgin or not status because they loved me for my intelligence, humour, personality, etc. and respected my choice to have sex when I felt ready - *as it should be*\n\nDo you want to be with someone who likes you as a person, or *because* they specifically want a virgin/someone sexually experienced? If it's the former, then why be bothered what a guy thinks about your virgin status? Don't let a guy reduce your worth down to \"virgin/not virgin\". You're better than that, and guys who do that are assholes.\n\n3) Don't feel ashamed about yourself. It's the most attractive when someone owns who they are no matter what it is than giving off the feeling they think there's something wrong with them. Know how confidence in a guy is sexy? Yeah it's sexy in girls too.",

You know those stories where someone goes through a traumatic injury like losing a limb, and their brain actively stops them from knowing it happened? That's basically what happened to me, but mentally.\n\nI went through the day after in a haze, feeling absolutely sick to my stomach with no idea why. My body knew something was wrong and the assault still had effects on me, but it was like my brain was actively blocking out the trauma and I couldn't function properly. I went through the motions of the day like a zombie, not actually being able to think much about anything or really knowing what was going on.\n\nI wasn't able to put it to the \"r\" word until I talked to someone about it later that day really confusedly and through all the jumble they said \"it sounds like you were raped\". And once I heard the r-word it's like my brain suddenly clicked the pieces into place, the fog lifted, and I was finally able to actually think about what actually happened, the tears started flowing, I went to the hospital to get a rape kit, police, etc. Even now there are still a lot of things about that night my brain blocked out that I can't recall.\n\nNot only that, the only reason I was only able to even do any of that was with all the love and support of those closest to me, who never for one second doubted me. Who even for the few months after that as I was recovering until I could be a normal functional human being again, took as much time out of their day as they can and put in so much effort to make me feel safe and cared for.\n\nThat was my personal experience - and I'm sure it's different for everyone. So this all goes back to that based on what you've said about her behaviour, it's actually not out of the ordinary for a rape victim and I think your gf isn't lying. What's more, as someone who has gone through this before your attitude towards this whole thing of \"she didn't act the way I think she should be I think she's lying\" is actually so triggering I can't help but be disgusted - which is why I'm even posting my experience here as well to hopefully give you more insight on why the way you're treating this situation is wrong and can actually make things way, way worse.",

She stood next to the fire for the whole duration of the burn. Nothin'. (So here I figured maybe it just doesn't work on Team Rumble and went back to Battle Royale.)\n\n\\- Shot people with the Dragon's Breath Shotgun (not sure if that's supposed to set the player themselves on fire or just structures, but that didn't work either)\n\nI have spent the last 2 hours trying anything I can think of, doing Solo, Squads, Team Rumble, with full inventories of gas cans and firefly jars to set anything around anyone I see on fire AND THIS SET A **SINGLE** OPPONENT ON FIRE QUEST JUST WILL NOT COMPLETE.\n\nEven after I've died dueling someone after setting the house on fire and I see they have some amount of missing HP that I'm very sure was from the fire damage because I DID NOT SHOOT THEM ONCE and kited them around a burning building.\n\nWhat the heck Epic.

But here I'm having my depressive episodes (I suffer from bipolar) and I certainly DON'T like to socialize at this time,  I'd like to be left alone in my room. My mom thinks I'm being rude to the guests since they want me to be in front of them like a clown. \n\nWhy do people think it's okay to show up unannounced but rude if someone doesn't feel receptive about it?"

I love a good challenge like this, especially since emblems were taken away and rewind feature isn\u2019t given until later. \n\nJean and Etie were the true stars. This sub really snoozes on them, which I understand. But dear god are they beasts once leveled. \n\nJean as a high priest pretty much deleted everyone. When coupled with Avoid +10 and Perception he pretty much becomes unhittable, especially when using bushes with cover. I ran Enslurge and Elfire. When the hounds came, I just used Etie (Sniper) and longbow w/ Canter to hit the Wyrven, move,  and then freeze Wyrven with Jean. I used Ivy duplicate to distract others, who are much easier to deal with. \n\nIvy and her duplicates bailed me out twice. And Alear could one shot one of the hounds with Body Art. \n\nWhat I\u2019m bummed about is killing the hounds, was especially difficult. And you get \u2026. Nothing for doing so. Such a bummer. They should reward you. \n\nAs an aside, if you prioritize both Jean and Etie they become absolute powerhouses. Etie and longbow + Canter is amazing. And Jean speed + magic makes him able to tank a hit and only get hit once (if he gets hit at all). \n\nJean: lvl 8 High Priest \n\nSkills: expertise (yes, please)/self-healing/avoid +10/perception. \n\nNon-buffed stats: \nHP: 35 \n\nStr: 9\n\nMag: 28\n\nDex: 19\n\nSpd: 18\n\nDef: 13\n\nRes: 23 (!) mages are a joke. He one shots them, too. \n\nLck: 15. \n\nGive him Eslurge + avoid skills and he\u2019ll delete any unit. \n\nEtie:\n\nSkills: No Distraction (crit +10)  and Canter for survival. \n\nLvl 8 Sniper\n\nHP: 34\n\nStr: 20\n\nMag: 1\n\nDex: 24\n\nSpd: 13 with longbow +1 and Marth engrave (for higher damage and crit chance. \n\nDef: 9\n\nRes: 10 \n\nLck: 13\n\nSure, she\u2019s a glass cannon, but w/ cantor and longbow, plus high strength, she seldom ever gets hit. Plan on giving her either Bld +4 or Momentum once I have the chance. With momentum and canter she can really set herself up for insane damage. Like Jean, she can often tank a hit, but she often dodges or is in position not to get hit thanks to Canter. \n\nAnyway. Such a bummer that there\u2019s no reward as in true FE fashion for beating the hounds. \n\nJean is a beast. You just have to make him a priority. But if you give him a master seal early, dear god he\u2019s a healer who can delete just about any enemy and dodge nearly all hits when outfitted correctly. \n\nUnpopular opinion, I know. Most don\u2019t like these units. But they\u2019re certainly S tier for me so far. \n\nShame I burned a freeze staff for nothing. Oh well."

And when there is no safe food, because I literally have crossed out way too much, I figure, I should just binge. If it isn't X amount of calories, I've already gone overboard, so why not just go to town with it, you know?\n\nAdditional question is, how do you find more safe foods? Or make it so that previous ones are still safe foods now? Because that changes so so frequently for me, a safe meal of mine was once hummus and ricecakes, then it became only ricecakes and now it's not ricecakes anymore either (mainly bc i underestimate how fast it adds up - i mean.. anything will if you eat a lot of it..I would eat so many ricecakes..).\n\nLet's talk?"

I know I counted cals, too, I just don't know for how long and how consistent; I blame my ptsd brain tho, my memories in general are wishywashy.\n\nI've been doing relatively okay the past month, I count cals again, i walk 10k every other day, i go to to danceclass 2-3 times a week, I make sure i eat enough protein, vitamins, fiber etc and i journal. I don't think i've ever been this \"strict\" and have never done \"this well\" and yet i feel like it's not enough. I catch myself breaking my 20h fast every like-- third day, sometimes i go slightly over my cal limit.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is, is this normal? I want to continue, I want to really lose the weight, but I don't \"remember\" how to do that anymore and have not been in this mindset for a while. I also always have this dread that if I don't do it well today, i lose all motiviation and fail entirely. I don't know for how long my discipline will let me keep going, if you get what I mean?\n\nI try to forgive myself when I fail a day, I don't really punish myself, after either (which was a previous habit that i would do), I just keep going but there's always this lingering fear that all of this will one day go to vain because i fail once and this one fail, unlike the many other \"small\" ones will be a forever-fail.\n\nlet's have a chitchat? maybe hearing that i am not alone in this will help me move along? i don't know how to deal with this mentally."

But this is no success story, it\u2019s a new approach I\u2019ll take that I think might bring brilliant results.\n\nPorn and masturbation bring Dopamine in extreme quantities to the brain, damaging our receptors. Therefore, we need more and more of it and never get satisfied. We know if we stop consuming porn and masturbating, these levels can go normal again with time, and we can enjoy life more because, since dopamine is needed, our brain will generate it for the other things we do in life.\n\nBut what if not only we drop porn and fapping, what if we drop, for 7 days, all other aspects that their only purpose is to give as dopamine? In my case, I can name chocolate, coffee, tv and netflix, social networks, videogames, soda, junk food, and if I go further, listening to music. Hear me out, these are not necessarily wrong or hurtful, but what if we drop them for 7 days? Then hopefully our brain will rewire to feel dopamine for otherwise boring stuff, like working, drinking water and maybe just going outside and breathe.\n\nI am doing this now because I am at the lowest point in my life since NoFap. This is because I have found a new porn tool that has gotten my brain stupid for more than a month, it\u2019s crazy how technology evolves and we need to evolve with it not to be consumed by it. I won\u2019t mention what this new tool is because I know most of you would fall into the pit again for months if you knew what it was. I had never had such dope rushes in my life and I need to get away from that now and for good. I can\u2019t go back there because it certainly is the killer of dreams. We need to get out from porn now and for good.\n\nSo I\u2019m starting this journey. I\u2019ll drop reddit now and hopefully come back when the days are over to tell you what happened.\n\nPeace out \u270c\ud83c\udffb"

I do believe the Woodcock Johnson (WJ-IV) was one of them to which they first said they believe my score is estimated 130 or higher, because thats sort of where the bellcurve lies for that one. The ceiling on the WAIS-III is 155. The 160 cap is for WISC-III and WAIS-IV. These were some that I\u2019ve been tested with where they gave me an estimate of 160 or higher, which the or higher is sort of meaningless in account of g-factor, but that\u2019s the situation.",

But what it means is that those who persist in the faith are saved, and if you don't, then you weren't really saved to begin with.  This is all well and good if you're judging and in/out-grouping other people, but when applied to yourself, it creates an existential crisis.  How do you know if you're saved if you aren't perfect in righteousness?  This leads to scrupulosity where people get re-baptised over and over and worry to death that they aren't truly saved.  The true christian doctrine is one of constant repentance and renewal, metanoia.  You don't need to be baptised again, you need to be perpetually made new as you live our your life in a corrupted body.  Salvation is not something you earn and it's not something that happened, it's something that *is happening*.\n\nSola Scriptura, for example: nobody but the most insular protestants suggest that you need nothing but scripture.  That you need a church to help you with it.  The whole test of propositions in Sola Scriptura is to find a scripture to back it up and there isn't one that backs up Sola Scriptura any more than there is one that backs up the Roman Catholic idea of purgatory.\n\nI say all this to tell you, once you're on the other side of the evangelical fence, you start to realize how incredibly fringe their beliefs are throughout history and the world.  It is certainly not all bad, but they have heaps of problems they don't need to have and starve for lack resources which they refuse.",

The water parameters are fine, it's fairly understocked, and I don't have any aggro fish in there.\n\nBut he croaked!\n\nI have no idea why.  I'd love to get a big fat snail in this tank, it grows green algae pretty well and he will be happy.  I put my daughter's apple snail in there, and he's fairly huge, and he just chugged around having a good old time. The new little snail didn't make it. He was pretty active at the store, I don't think he was dying when I got him. Any tips for how to prevent this from happening, or should I just chalk it up to dumb luck and try again?"

The task is not easy because modern man has become illiterate, no longer able to read symbols; it is almost as if their existence is not even suspected. This happens also with the symbol of our body. Our body is a symbol because it is an intimate union of soul and body; it is the visibility of the spiritual soul in the corporeal order; and in this consists human uniqueness, the specificity of the person irreducible to any other form of living being. Our openness to the transcendent, to God, is constitutive of us. Not to recognize this leads us inevitably not only to a not knowing of God but also to not knowing ourselves. It is enough to look at the paradoxical way in which the body is treated, in one moment cared for in an almost obsessive way, inspired by the myth of eternal youth, and in another moment reducing the body to a materiality to which there is denied every dignity. The fact is that value cannot be given to the body starting only from the body itself. Every symbol is at the same time both powerful and fragile. If it is not respected, if it is not treated for what it is, it shatters, loses its force, becomes insignificant.*"

why not see a mental health doctor ? you can try therapy if you want. someone can help you.\n\nyes, going crazy and being so hurt mentally and emotionally helped me to grow up and to realize some things i would ignore when i was myself. now that i'm free from that, i enjoy every single days and i'm less sad than before. i don't have a perfect life : i have no friends, i'm ugly, not really smart, super quiet. but after expericing this mental torture, i love my life so much and i don't care if i don't fit in. i'm not afraid of negative emotions like before. i know i cand handle them cause i lived with so much worse six months ago.\n\nidk i think i'm still a little bit numb emotionally but as the days goes, my emotions start to come back slowly. but idc about my LO anymore. let's be honest, LO is just a normal human like anyone else. i don't care how much you love them, how much you think they are unique. they are just like you, just like everyone. they seem like the best person of this world cause you put them on a pedestal.\n\ni'm not mad at him anymore. i'm not indifferent neither, actually. i still have some affection for this person, but that's it. i would never date him, even if he would ask me out. why would i ? what did he bring in my life, except sorrow and the feeling of being too uninteresting for him ? he didn't do anything wrong, but i don't want this person in my life. we're incompatible, even as friends. not only because of limerence, but also because of his indifference for me. i don't need to make efforts for someone who barely wanted to talk to me. there's so much person in this planet. i can find someone else. it's okay.\n\nto end this giant text, i just want to say that limerence is a real disorder. it's something serious, take it seriously.\n\nwhat saved me was (in order) :\n\n1. my anger and my love for myself when i realized my LO never cared about me and my sadness\n2. no contact (i eventually broke NC twice, but it was in december and january so a really long time after saying bye to him)\n3. medication (accutane. this thing is supposed to make you depressed, and i think it made me depressed for a bit. but the best thing was : emotional numbness. ik nobody is gonna be okay with it but it really saved me. antidepressants would be better cause it's suited for depression, OCD, limerence, etc.) but again, i don't recommend this for everyone. i think it's better to first try NC + therapy. i never wanted to take antidepressants even if i had lots of mental health problems. like i said i took accutane only for my acne. but it helped me to escape from my obsessions and compulsions (first time in my life) and i'm not saying my OCD and limerence are 100% gone, but the majority of it has gone. don't take this decision quickly, cause medication have some side effects that can be serious (for accutane i had a lot of them, but i think it worth it). and don't take accutane if you don't have severe acne of course\n\ni know you're hurting. but if i healed, you can heal too. there is hope for you. be patient. seek for help. do some researchs. keep fighting to get out of this. i thought i would never be myself again, and like you i was reading reddit posts of people that got free from limerence. i always wanted to write one of this, cause that would mean i would be free. today that's me. i'm one of theses lucky people. tomorrow, it's gonna be you. never loose hope. it's gonna get better one day, and life won't feel the same anymore. you're going to thrive, cause you would finally understand that your simple life is beautiful. you're going to love yourself, but a lot more than before.\n\nthanks for reading. take care everyone."

Like in ESTJs, Ni helps compensate for inferior Fi, although this is done with ENTJs focusing on what they view as the most likely outcome in a situation.

He has never loved the wet food, I\u2019ve read it\u2019s just not appetizing for them.  So we mix some regular wet food in and only then will he eat it.  We also keep a dish of dry food out at all times and honestly, he prefers it.  I\u2019ve seen him pass the wet food dish and scarf the dry food.  Then the wet food gets old on the dish and gets tossed.\n\nSo my question is, would it be okay if Ollie was given just the prescribed dry food?  Does that give him all the treatment he requires? He has been drinking a lot of water lately so that\u2019s good, I know hydration is key and is a reason for wet food.\n\nThanks! Ollie appreciates your help \u263a\ufe0f"

                "body": "[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/ztl5ka/no\\_surf\\_january/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/ztl5ka/no_surf_january/)\n\nAbove is the initial post \\^\\^\\^  Here's how it went..\n\n**The first week (great!):**  \nWent pretty great!  I'm always excited about a New Years Resolution and I was ready to go hard.  I uninstalled Reddit and Instagram from my phone (haven't had Facebook since 2017), and logged out on my computer.  My goals with my free time were to read one book per month, start crocheting a granny square blanket, watch the news instead of scrolling for it, and watch more films/tv.  Also text friends directly and establish a better connection than passive likes and comments on social media.  I did all of these things and felt proud.\n\n**By the end of the second week (major relapse):**  \nI collapsed, totally caved in.  I had had two extremely busy weeks at work since we lost a couple of our top employees.  I'd come home completely and utterly exhausted (it's a 100% physical job) and didn't want to do anything at all, nothing interested me.  I also was getting hit HARD with post holiday depression AND seasonal depression with the short dark winter days (like seriously, bad time of the year to start some life changes lol).  My husband was also distant and sad having experienced the first holiday season without his father (who passed almost a year ago), and was isolating himself with video games.  I was feeling sad myself, and lonely.  So I did NOT want to any of the goals I had listed above, they felt completely out of reach for me.  I came home one evening, crashed on the couch, reinstalled Instagram and Reddit and scrolled for hours.  I felt like a gross slug.  Very disappointed in myself.  The endless scroll was just so easy and soothing though, like a drug.  Before I knew it it was bedtime.  The scroll allowed my mind to turn off in a really unhealthy way before actually turning off for sleep.\n\nI was scrolling A LOT, Instagramming A LOT, and feeling REALLY BAD about myself.. getting disappointed if I didn't get enough likes or comments, comparing myself to everyone who was seemingly having a great time and feeling worthless old and unattractive, silently raging over friends braggy idyllic tropical vacation photos.  Then I was getting sucked unto negative circlejerk/debate subs and feeling like a lousy person for it.. really negative places that encourage this awful negative mindset, for me at least.\n\n**By the beginning of the last week of Jan (a second try):**  \nANYWAY, we got some new hires, so work eased up a ton.  I busted out my sad lamp to use in the morning, and started journaling again in the evening.  I talked to my husband and and told him I needed extra support and validation right now, and that I'm here to support him as well, and he's been great, spending extra time with me, less on video games, more togetherness and communication, etc.  I finally started the granny square blanket, I've made 30 so far, each a different color!  Oh I also finally started my other goal of going through this entire bread making book, and baked the first loaf of cheesy bread!  Also picked the book back up that I left off halfway through.  The ball started rolling on all these non-surf activities!  So much so that the time surfing started to slow down a lot..\n\nThen a few days ago I casually hopped on instagram for a bit and saw tons of pics of two of my good friends from high school on vacation together in Mexico seemingly having a blast.  While I am happy for my friends having a good time, in that moment I SNAPPED and was so PISSED.  It just felt like a huge humble brag like \"aren't you jealous?\" kind of post (these two, love them, but they are soo typical for it), and right then and there I fully deleted my account.  I was just like fuck this, I don't need to see this shit, I'm done.  And it felt good.  I'm guilty of deactivating and reactivating, it finally felt good to just LET IT GO for real this time.\n\nI decided to keep reddit and to make a better habit of staying away from the negative subs.  I even asked some really bad debate subs to pls block me, and they did haha.  I really like my niche subreddits I follow, such fun interesting things to talk about, and I like to get news from here, and I like joining in conversations.  I like being anonymous and not knowing anyone, so the comparison game doesn't crop up.  I'm really introverted and shy so having some kind of online community has always been genuinely helpful for me.  So now that it's just Reddit I'll do my best to manage how many hours I spend on here!\n\n**As for February:**  \nSo basically, after going all in at the start of Jan, falling hard on my face, I want to go a little easier on myself.  But, since the ball got rolling on all my goals above I want to keep them rolling, as IRL activities seem to really be helping with staying away from surfing!  But if I am exhausted after work one evening I want to allow myself an hour or two on Reddit to unwind, and then go back to my goals/projects irl activities.  I'll try to find the right balance there and if I'm scrolling too much again take a step back and look at the whole picture and see what could be causing the urge (like what happened in my crash).  And, I want to let the 30 day wait period for full Insta deletion to pass and feel fully free from that awful app.  And I want to communicate with my husband when I feel lonely, or text friends, really foster my relationships in real life instead of keeping up with people passively through online photos and comments.\n\n**TLDR;** Anyway, this was really long winded and I apologize for it.  I just want anyone reading this to know that going completely nosurf is going to be HARD.  You will likely fall on your face a few times until you are able to realize what kind of balance will be best for you at this time in your life.  Maybe you will go cold turkey just fine, maybe you'll need a few hours a day with some kind of app.  Anything is better than whatever your current situation is.  Baby steps are okay too.  Just don't give up, and work towards finding the path that best suits you and your story right now."

And all I see on Instagram are photos of my friends on vacations in Mexico, Puerto Rico, California, Florida, all on the beach with drinks in their hands.  While I am happy for them, after the 12th photo I can't help but feel like saying \"fuck you\".  One of them is even on a vacation FROM their vacation, to an even better location.  \n\nTo me it's no different than sharing a new expensive car or house.  It's bragging.\n\nIn the past 10 years I've gotten new cars, a new house, renovated bathroom, gone on nice vacations, and more.  Those things are NOT what I share online.  I share tidbits of my home life, things I've created, art, craft projects, my garden, passions.   I hate HATE the comparison game I subject myself to, the envy and jealousy.  Maybe my posts invoke jealousy and annoyance too, I don't know.  Maybe it's ALL fucking stupid.  But I just feel the keeping up with the Jones's spirit ESPECIALLY with the smug vacation pics.  They make me feel miserable.\n\nAnyway, I know woe is me bla bla just get off Instagram.. I'm trying.  I like the sense of community with a small group of people on there, but even then I can't escape the competitive content, it always sneaks in.  \n\nSo I've once again deactivated my account.  But I'd love to full out delete it.  Can someone, anyone, please list some reasons why a full deletion would be beneficial to my health?  And how I won't regret it?  And all the positives that will come from it?  If I don't delete I think I'll just keep signing back in.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nAlso I posted late DEC about a Jan No Surf club, and that's been absolute shit lol.  Can't wait to share what I learn and what my hopes are for Feb.  Sigh."

They have so much more meaning to me now as I was able to pick up on the incredibly rich symbolism I has missed before.  The first one I ever saw was Kiki and upon rewatch it still holds a truly special place in my heart.. it's so calming, simple, yet so moving.  Princess Kaguya was the only one to make me absolutely BAWL my eyes out, that ending, just wow.  And Howl's Moving Castle was the most incredibly creative fever dream.\n\nSoo the last movie that I watched (well about 15 minutes of) was Earwig, and that would be placed at the very bottom, but the thumbnail wasn't included in the generator.\n\nAnd I actually haven't watched Grave of the Fireflies yet.  Is it streaming anywhere, or can I rent it on Prime?\n\nInterested in your thoughts!"

No one else around, but the road was busy enough in which a handful of cars passed by me ever few minutes. Suddenly, a gray nice-ish car driving in my direction slows down, pulls up beside me, window rolls down, I look in the window assuming it must be a tourist asking for directions (happens often), but.. it's just a dude.. maybe in his late 20s.. not very attractive, not very fit... and he looks at me and asks me dead ass \"Can I get your insta handle\"?\n\nLike... wtf..?\n\nIt was dark, cold and rainy (like I said).  I was covered up completely except for my face and glasses - hood up and everything.  This man somehow recognizes the covered up shape is a woman, and thinks it's appropriate to do what I just described?  How was he even interested in me, I was in his view for no more than 5 seconds as nothing more than a blur with a womanly shape on the road?  Like, was it just his radar going \"WOMAN SPOTTED - MUST APPROACH\".  It was so BIZARRE and felt so insanely inappropriate.\n\nI was so taken aback I was just like \"um.. \\*pause - shakes head\\*.. I don't have one, sorry \\*nervously laughs\\*\".  He drove away, I kept walking.\n\nI didn't get to look at him for more than a few seconds, but it was a zero looks match.  Even if he were attractive I would have been totally weirded/creeped out.  I walked away with my dog genuinely scared, I kept looking back over my shoulder when I heard a car coming, hoping it wasn't him.. I was wondering, what if he had a gun or something?  I know that's extreme, but that's how startled and put off I was by what had just randomly happened.  Like what if he told me to get in the car?  Would my dog (not my dog, I'm a dog walker), have protected me?\n\nI'm just confused, like did he think I was supposed to be flattered?  Did he think this shape of a woman would be thrilled that someone just startled her on the street?  That he really had a chance?\n\nWomen on TwoX - can you help me understand this please?  I've been married for over 10 years, I really don't experience this kind of thing often anymore, but this was just fucked up imo."

                "body": "i\u2019m almost 20 years old, and for most of my teenage and adult life i have been extremely hesitant to attempt to make friends with cis men (despite desperately craving male friends) because i am honestly terrified of them, particularly cishet men. i very rarely have good relationships with cishet men outside of my immediate family because more than often, they immediately or later on sexually harass me. the trauma makes me exceptionally anxious around cishet men and for the most part i restrict my friendships to queer spaces for my own safety and mental well-being.\n\nwell in march i got a new job and i wanted to change that. i applied to my job and worked stealth, but in april i got outed by a coworker who misgendered me and i corrected. me being outed didn\u2019t stop my coworkers (mostly cishet men) from correctly gendering me and respecting me, and at this point i considered about 7 or 8 of the boys to be on friendly acquaintance terms with me, and i had contact information with 3 of them (let\u2019s call them E, M and H.)\n\nnow E is particularly friendly with everyone, and about two months into working there he\u2019d come up with a nickname for me (which he does for all of the boys). i considered E to be a friend and we\u2019d often chat about stuff, ranging from sports to complicated emotions. E doesn\u2019t have a pristine reputation (he\u2019s incredibly flirtatious with female customers and has said some ignorant things i chalked up to lack of knowledge or inexperience, but would apologize if corrected) but i found him to be friendly, respectful and entertaining. it came down to the point where, when someone flirted with him and made him uncomfortable, i came to his defense.\n\nrecently, however, two things changed. firstly, about a month ago, a new coworker (let\u2019s call her C) aggressed me for no apparent reason. C screamed at me and started intentionally misgendering me, and while E tried to placate her, i asked E (an assistant manager) for permission to end my shift early. he gave me permission and i left. i reported her behavior to my manager and she was spoken to about it. second, as my 20th birthday is coming up, my name was displayed with a happy birthday announcement. however the office unintentionally deadnamed me and it got broadcast to the entire store, and now everyone knows my deadname (i\u2019ve yet to be deadnamed intentionally but i know they know). i confided with E how i felt about it, which he reassured me it was likely an accident and that he sees me just as my chosen name and would never call me my deadname. \n\nhowever, H (who is in a D&D game i run) revealed something to me. last night, E and C were gossiping with a new hire behind my back. i am physically unfit (roughly 110 lbs and 5\u20198\u201d) and to maintain my energy i often sit down when i have no immediate work. the new hire was complaining about this, but in response, C and E began misgendering me. E claimed i was \u201csexually confused\u201d.\n\ni am terrified. E, although nice to me, is surprisingly touchy. aside from E, M is the only one who has made any physical contact with me at my work outside of fist bumps and handshakes, but M has only done so to help me carry things i am not or to not shove me by accident. E playfully grabbed me to hide behind me, and typically refrains from making physical contact with his other coworkers. i am afraid he sees me as a cishet woman in denial and i\u2019m devastated. i am appalled by the sheer betrayal of my trust and upset that a budding friendship was demolished so completely.\n\ntransphobia is against company policy. at the very least, he would be disciplined if i report this to HR, and at most extreme, he could be fired. however, H wants to remain anonymous. H has very extreme social anxiety and as his friend i want to keep his name out of this. given that, what do you guys think i should do aside from telling my manager? i\u2019m in shambles emotionally right now.\n\ni\u2019m just so tired of having cishet men repeatedly betray my trust because they see me as attractive and can\u2019t cope.\n\nEDIT 8.11.2022: i let my manager know the situation. currently four people (including my manager) have offered to keep ears out in case E and C say anything else, bless all four of their souls. i also wrote \u201ctrans rights are human rights\u201d on the work whiteboard.\ni\u2019m 90% on the possibility that they know that i know, but so far i\u2019ve been watching them both like a hawk. nothing has happened yet but E became more and more erratic until i left work tonight. my hostility was likely not something he\u2019d expected. i am safe and if anything else happens i\u2019ll update this."

They decided to leave a pirate lieutenant alive (she was the fighter\u2019s ex-wife) and brought her with (albeit tied up) while they killed the rest of her fellows, including her current partner. As the pirates in question were hellbent on conquering the region by force, this wasn\u2019t too off base. However, even as they went to collect the McGuffin that the pirate captain sought (that actually wasn\u2019t as valuable as he thought it was), things drastically got worse.\n\nThe party\u2019s ship had a somewhat bumpy landing on the island they had docked on, and the lieutenant they left alive escaped her bonds. However, as she had no ship of her own and was vastly outnumbered and unarmed, she made no moves to resist and simply sat on the island. It was after about thirty minutes of this docile behavior that the party remembered her presence and decided to kill her. **The pirate lieutenant, unwilling to sacrifice the last of her dignity, opted instead to jump into the water, ending her own life on her own terms.**\n\nThe party rogue and warlock, both possessing underwater breathing and swim speeds, both jumped into the water not to save her, but to watch her drown for the fun of it. Both players described to me their characters jumping in the water, and I, assuming they meant to rescue her, described her as still being alive. However, instead of saving her, both players cheerfully informed me that they intended to instead \u201cmake sure she died\u201d. The NPC got the pleasure of knowing she suffocated to death with an audience. \n\nThe rogue and warlock then lied to the rest of the party and claimed she was already dead. The wizard saw through that lie.\n\nI\u2019ve been running this game with my players knowing since session zero that their alignments can and will change if I believe their actions no longer fit their alignment. The rogue was lawful neutral, and the warlock was chaotic good. Due to their actions, the rogue is now lawful evil, and the warlock is chaotic neutral. My players had no issue with this change, but I\u2019m wondering: was this major enough to warrant an alignment shift? \n\n(Their alignments will most likely shift back to good/neutral in the future. This is not permanent.)\n\nEDIT: some things people missed or i missed:\n- NPC in question was not killed by the PCs. they were not confirming their own kill. the NPC was trying to end her own life.\n- my players consented to me as a DM adjusting alignments in session 0. they are not angry with this. i am just asking to see if you as a group thought i made a good call. \n- i run magic items that need alignments to function (see *book of exalted deeds* or *talisman of ultimate evil* from the dungeon master\u2019s guide). alignment is a mechanic in my game just like stats. if i let my players fuck about with their own alignments, they could theoretically cheat into getting a magic item.\n\n-pirates aren\u2019t automatically evil. they\u2019re humanoids. humanoids have versatile alignments.\n\nEDIT 2: please stop telling me that alignment is outdated or that i put too much emphasis on it. it\u2019s irrelevant to this post. if you don\u2019t like alignment just don\u2019t use it at your tables. i\u2019m not going to stop using it at mine.\n\nEDIT 4: party wizard would like to add: she yelled to get the rogue and warlock to rescue the pirate"

Belief is not blind - belief must be confirmative. \n\nDo you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason?\n\n(2:44) \n\n1- For one thing: I find that the desire for eternal life is given to me - I did not create that desire. I long to be happy, healthy with my loved ones. The one who created the need within me must also necessarily created that which I need.  Just as the need for sustenance looks to the sustenance itself and the giver of the sustenance, so does the need for eternl life. \n\n  \n2- Secondly, I undergo a sort of death every day. This takes the form of sleep where I \"die\" and I am resurrected in the morning again. In a similar vein, my being, my memories, my consciousness is created for me at every.single.moment. One moment of my being does NOT necessitate that I exist the next, yet here I am. \n\n3- Thirdly, within the created world, I can also see a sort of resurrection happening every year, every season, every month. For example, trees blossom with life in the spring yet they decay in the fall and autumn, becoming bare like bones. In the following spring, they are brought back to life again. \n\n4- Fourthly, I can experience a \"heavenly,\" or a \"hellish\" state of being right now. If I do not view the world with God consciousness (meaning that I do not do my best to train myself to aim to be in a conscious state of being and establish a relationship with my Creator in knowing that I am being given existence to and that everything is consciously, mercifully created for me), then I find myself in a hellish state of being (meaning that I view things as being haphazard - I assign qualities to beings or things that are dependent themselves - I find myself hopeless). In a way, I EXPERIENCE what is to come in my experiences right here and right now. It's like an indicator or 'sample' before the full meal. \n\nIf my Creator is giving me guidance in the form of speech (i.e. scripture), I must utilize it with my human feelings along with the action of my Creator (i.e. the universe) to confirm it.",

The leaves closes to the base have always been a bit sad looking since those are also the leaves with the edges \"burnt.\"\n\nDoes anyone know what these specs are?\n\nI touched them, watched them and I do not think theyre little bugs. I did have spider mites on another plant not too long ago, so I know how those spider mites move around, but from what I could tell, this is likely a symptom of something else? I have two other avocado plants which are \"spec\" free.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjl3gnlrb1691.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1a87a4ef1e78987e5717dd4fd30f9bb3df547587\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rpo25qlrb1691.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=95022b5cb483e3be5a5c35f9289568f605f9334a\n\n[\\\\\"burnt edges](https://preview.redd.it/zimgwrlrb1691.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a322083ff7eba4f5bb9c075b1dcbada2c625ade)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1f1pnlrb1691.jpg?width=2095&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dcab065da142e3ac025a788ec055abd723ce530c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05nlxtlrb1691.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c2f1a743f8c138d80310c7e9003dfbb321a4dc5e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7jpiulrb1691.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5516313e0272d5f2bcadf575bc7f89efd58fd4cc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4mdxkvlrb1691.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e796f7e6f632d2bb919381eb3babfb7476ae2771\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9rhpfxlrb1691.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fbd3b6a2492609e7d50b11858863f30c2f1daa61\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bo0xtylrb1691.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3fa2dcaf27a5e666c46a63229141860ae7c5d75b"

With the plant in the photo, some of the tips of the leaves are dried out (and based on my research, that's due to salt accumulation). I've repotted them with as much new soil as possible (as part of the previous soil was integrated into the root systems).\n\nApologies in advance for the not so best quality photo. Also, before anyone asks: there is a hole on one of the bottom leaves. It was a small hole which just grew as the leaf grew, but this was prior to the leaves turning in like this + a one off case.\n\nWhy is my poor avocado plant sad :c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlant image is here: [https://i.ibb.co/VgDyHjY/avocado-plant.png](https://i.ibb.co/VgDyHjY/avocado-plant.png)"

Of the blood tests I did, a couple of them were apparently experimental.\n\nSoon afterwards, I received an explanation of benefits (EOB), stating specifically it's not a bill, from my health insurance (Aetna). The EOB stated that I may be responsible for paying up to nearly a grand, although it seemed to be pending. I never received a bill from anyone other than LabCorp for the work which I paid in a timely fashion. I still haven't received any updates, but just in case I have a pending bill and to avoid anything from going into collection, I gave them a call today and it was a mess-- I was transferred to 3 people over the course of 1+ hour only to tell me that their claims team would give me a call back in the next few days.\n\nSince I never received a bill (as this may still be pending) and since I was never warned that these bloodwork were experimental and thereby not covered, am I still potentially responsible for paying nearly a grand?"

After lasting me for over a decade, my desktop has passed... to a better place.\n\nI have now been looking into potentially purchasing a pre-built or individual parts myself to build my first computer for personal usage & work.\n\n\\>\\*\\*What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.\\*\\* \n\nThe computer would mainly need to be used for video making and editing/rendering, etc, with a bit of game play (whenever I can find time tbh). I would use majority of the Adobe Suite products. Rendering would be in 1080p, but would like ability to render in 4k if needed (though not a must). Since rendering would be done both with cpu and gpu, having them be \"equivalent.\" As for gaming, it would mainly be League of Legends, and would like the ability to also play Valorant and/or OverWatch. \n\n\\>\\*\\*What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?\\*\\*  \n\nI have some flexibility as this PC will essentially work as work PC as needed. Up 2.5k USD if really worth it.\n\n\\>\\*\\*When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.\\*\\*  \n\nThe sooner the better! \n\n\\>\\*\\*What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\\\\)\\*\\*  \n\nOnly the tower. \n\n\\>\\*\\*Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?\\*\\*  \n\nNJ, USA. Yes, I do have access to Microcenter. \n\n\\>\\*\\*If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.\\*\\*  \n\nReusing gaming mouse, basic keyboard/camera/mic, as well as an Acer monitor, but would likely be looking to upgrade monitor and/or add a second monitor eventually. Current monitor is I believe around 70hz.>\\*\\*Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?\\*\\*  \n\n\\>\\*\\*Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)\\*\\* \n\n\\* Replace this text with answer. \n\n\\>\\*\\*Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?\\*\\* \n\nFancy lights are nice, but not a must. I do like prefer physically smaller/low maintenance parts in general. Maybe glass so I can know when to clean it of dust, though not a must either. If anything, being as small as possible is preferred. \n\n\\>\\*\\*Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?\\*\\* \n\nYes. Windows 10 or 11 would be fine. \n\n\\>\\*\\*Extra info or particulars:\\*\\*\n\nA point of reference for products/pieces would be recommended and/or websites. I think it would likely be good for the Motherboard to give me the opportunity to eventually upgrade/add ad ons should I need in them in the future. I would like to best utilize my budget on the parts that will best help me get the experience I want which will likely be the CPU, GPU, and RAM if I'm not mistaken. If possible, a bit of explanation as to why you chose the parts that you did would be much appreciated as well as if you yourself use those parts and if so, for what purpose? \n\nI have this SSD [https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-Internal-3500MB-Compact/dp/B099RHVB42?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-Internal-3500MB-Compact/dp/B099RHVB42?th=1) that I can use as an external/secondary storage area for what its worth.\n\nThanks!"

Mandatory afternoon naps with Grandma when I was a kid was the only time I ever napped successfully, but only after lying in bed for an hour waiting for sleep to come. Even then I only managed to nap half the time.\n\nHigh school... College... I only ever napped once, it was before an exam and when I woke up my brain was so much clearer and I swear my eyesight got better too. It was crazy. And I was an Architecture student, so we barely slept, yet somehow I never slept/napped in school. Even during times I was awake for 3 whole days and I was hallucinating, I just finished my work, went home and slept for 12 hrs straight.\n\nUnfortunately that one power nap has never happened again. I even bought pillows for work so I can 'pretend' nap during lunch. I would just have my head on the pillow and spend 10 minutes thinking up plans/things to do. \n\nI wish I could nap, really, it would make me more productive now that I'm getting older and can't handle the constant 4-5hr only sleep schedule (I have a side business on top of work). I try as much as possible to get 6 hrs of sleep a day, only on the weekends could I get the coveted 8 hrs of sleep.\n\nI have coworkers that nap everyday, just zonks out to dreamland in under a minute. I really wish I knew how they do it. Any tips would be much appreciated."

My eyes trick me moreso than average and I'm afraid of having hallucinations. \n\nLast night I was thinking about this because I fell asleep and had a dream that a woman came into my bedroom. The dream was more vivid than anything I've ever had. I usually only \"see\" people for about 3 seconds before they disappear. I'm worried that I might develop a paranoia induced psychosis, or perhaps that I've already started to as I heard the banging on the door after I had feats about people breaking in. \n\nI have always had brief delusional episodes that are bizarre in nature, but no hallucinations that last more than 5 seconds.

I've been eating recommended weight gain foods such as whole milk, full fat yogurt, avocados, walnuts, and peanut butter. All this is making me have a very high fat diet which is no good, that can still leave my organs coated in fat.\n\nA typical day of eating may look like this\n\nBreakfast\n- oatmeal with strawberries and a protein bar or yogurt with bananas and walnuts\n\nLunch \n- high protien pasta with tomato sauce and spinach and feta cheese or a chicken wrap with veggies \n\nSnack 1\n- walnuts or almonds\n\nSnack 2\n- a shake made with full fat yogurt, whole milk, 1 banana, and peanut butter\n\nDinner\n- brown rice with black beans or chicken, corn, salsa, and a bit of cheese\n \nSnack 3\n- fortified cereal with milk and strawberries \n\nI've determined I'm eating a lot of yogurt so I just bought it for the shakes and for breakfast I either now try to have oatmeal or fortified cereal, im also considering taking the peanut butter out of the shakes and just making them with berries and protein powder. I hear it's recommended for underweight people to always have the full fat dairy options and consume a lot of \"healthy fats\" like avocados, nuts, and certain cheeses.

There's just certain kinds of pain that give me this almost comforting feeling, maybe like a fulfilling or satisfying one too.\nKind of hesitating posting this because it feels weird to admit since pain is supposed to be a negative feeling and it feels unnatural for it not to be.

I'm super passionate about certain things and I like to sit on my phone listening to my favourite artist or watching one of his specials, the entire group just talk to me like I'm insane for doing what I like. I joke about being crazy obsessed because that's what they all see when I'm just passionate because he means a lot to me on a personal level, I've always had problems being able to control how I come off because if I start talking about something I like I just cant stop and I start to get super annoying and I hate when I do that because it ruins peoples first impressions of me. anyway I'm considering leaving the group anyway because orange is leaving the school next year and shes kind of the only reason I sit with them, it wouldnt make a difference if I left anyway so.\n\napologies this kind of didnt have a direction."

I ended up finishing CC with a 3.2 GPA. After transferring to my 4 year University I wised up, figured out what I wanted to do and I finished with a 3.6 GPA at my 4 year.\n\nWould it be worth it back to CC and try to build an alternate transcript by taking math courses, I am confident now that I am more focused and more mature than I was during my freshman and sophomore year. Or should I just be aiming for a higher than avg GMAT in the future. I would like to aim for M7/T15"

It's my only source of comfort, I feel like whenever bad things happen I go back into crying into the arms of OCD while it tells me that its the only thing I need in my life.

There were some that needed a second listen to fully appreciate, but Orchid and Heritage I just disliked my first time. I could tell that they had a lot of creativity behind them, but I didn\u2019t understand the way I was supposed to listen to them or thought that they had very obvious flaws (with Orchid, it was that things went on way too long and that there was no structure to the songs. On heritage, it was that there were too many nearly silent moments and that there wasn\u2019t a build to any release.)\nMy opinion on Orchid changed when I went for a winter walk with it playing on my headphones. Seeing some nature around me and being cold made the music click.\nHeritage is just now clicking for me. I\u2019m listening to it at 2AM, it\u2019s very quiet, and I\u2019m slightly tired. I can hear all the small nuances and all the dynamics, and it\u2019s like the jazzy side of the band that has always been present was brought to the forefront with this record. It\u2019s like it\u2019s meant to be experienced at 2AM\nAnyone else have similar experiences with music finally clicking when they experience it in a different way?"

I've worked at target for a good while now and for the most part I could safely say that I like my coworkers and my TLs and even tho my ETL could def do better (or step down), it's better than my last job.\n\nTonight I stand corrected. Now a little back story for this, I have a coworker who we'll call Sunny. She's very sweet, and she's technically a Style TM. She's been scheduled in S&E for the next 2 weeks because corporate still won't give Style the hours needed for their staff, but Sunny needs the hours so she's temporarily under our schedule. She's a really sweet kid, very efficient, kind, understanding, and willing to learn and adapt to new spots (Service desk, drive up, etc.)\n\nWhile I was on my lunch today, roughly around 5:50-6pm, she comes running into the break room absolutely bawling her eyes out. Obviously me and the others in there are concerned. So we go comfort her and try to get what happened and she explains:\n\nShe had been at the check lanes and a guest with 3 palettes/crates of eggs (literally all the eggs we have left) comes through her lane. Sunny nonchalantly goes \"so what's with all the eggs? Are you throwing a party?\" Just out of curiosity (and also why are we allowed to sell a guest that many goddamn eggs??)\n\nThe guest does not respond, and instead begins to belittle and condescend Sunny for struggling. Sunny's not super great with math, and that's a lot of fucking eggs, on top of not being able to see the eggs in general. The guest keeps going \"it's not hard. It's really simple. Let me make it easier for you.\" And so on, repeatedly, and confusing Sunny further. Sunny is visibly struggling. My TL, who is watching the whole thing, does not offer help. Does not check in. Doesn't say a word. He just stands there. Watching. Someone else, who is not a cashier, who is not in our department, and has watched the whole thing to this point, stepped in to help. The guest was incredibly rude the entire time.\n\nWe get to the point where Sunny is in the breakroom, we call the Closing TL over, he knows exactly who the guest was and will make a note about them, etc. Sunny got a talking to by my TL and he told her that she is at fault for being \"too aggressive\" when asking about the eggs (there are witnesses to attest against this) and she should \"stop taking shifts for S&E\" even tho she literally has no control over it. And then my same TL had to write an email to hee ACTUAL Style TL about the conversation, and so on. She had a panic attack and broke down sobbing in HR's office over the situation being her fault when it was, based on the evidence we have, not her fault at all.\n\nThis is my same TL who says he'd never abandon his team. I don't know what to do but if they give her a CA even tho it's not her fault and everyone else knows it, I'm taking it to HR. There were two other check lanes and several other witnesses to the situation. Even other guests were worried about Sunny. Literally our entire closing team is gonna side with her because the guest was tryna finesse and our S&E TL fucking let them without even trying to help anything at all.\n\nTL;DR: A guest made my coworker have a literal mental breakdown by making her feel stupid and then my \"loyal and caring\" TL blamed said coworker for how rude the guest was being and not helping when she was struggling despite all other evidence pointing to literally the opposite and then trying to get her department to give her a corrective action"

Both times they said there was no mistake and that my food was ready but for one reason or another they had not brought it to me / they were about to bring it to my seat\n\nThe other 2 time my food never came at all. I walked out after the movie was over and ask if my food was ready and I got the same line, \u201csorry about that sir we were about to bring it out to you\u201d, the person not realizing that the movie was over\n\nAfter the 4th time this happened, after the movie, I walked up to the counter and told them what had happened with my previous orders and that I was disappointed in the quality of service \n\nThe manager that I was talking to rolled his eyes and gave one of those \u201ccan you believe this guy\u201d looks to the employee standing across from him who grinned and laughed a little.  \n\nAfter that I left feeling kinda stupid and very annoyed \n\nSo was it an asshole move to complain? AITA?\n\nPs. Have asked to wait for my food at the counter but they said it\u2019s easier for their system for me to wait in my seat\n\nEdit: people are asking why I keep going/ ordering from them \n\nI keep going because the theater itself is the best in my area, best screens, best seats, best sound quality \n\nI keep ordering because I\u2019m the only person I know that this happens to.

I bought three more Seagate IronWolf drives to replace two of the older & smaller drives in the system and to fill in the empty drive bay. Using SHR with 2 drive fault tolerance and a single storage pool.\n\nSo I deactivated one of the older drives and put in the new larger drive and rebuilt the volume. In the process it automatically did the data scrubbing and that revealed an issue with drive 1 (not the drive I replaced or one of the older drives) with 8 bad sectors. So I ran the SMART Extended Test on that drive, along with the IronWolf Health test. IronWolf test came back good. SMART test shows a value of 8 in the Raw Data section for ID 5. IDs 197 & 198 both show zero for the raw data.\n\nI realize this means that the drive found 8 sectors that were bad and reallocated the data to it\u2019s extra space that\u2019s set aside for that purpose. As I understand it though that\u2019s fairly typical for modern drives and as long as that count doesn\u2019t increase again the drive could remain healthy. Do I really need to swap out the drive as recommended or is that overkill? The drive is still under warranty and will be until June 2025. Thoughts?"

How did the Master survive? He literally killed his future self at the end of the 12th Doctor\u2019s run, and they never explained how he was suddenly still alive?\n\n2. At the end of Flux arc did the universe basically get destroyed except for Earth? Like that\u2019s how they\u2019re going to leave it?!"

Im an only child. \n\nHe gets a power trip about me being dependent on him. \n\nIm 18, since i was 16 i've been begging for him to teach me/let me enroll in a driving school (i've been working since i was 13 and have more than enough money for tuition and extra lessons i need more hours of instruction) \n\nI live in a car dependent suburb surrounded by highways so i really have no choice. \n\nI'll ask: \"Hey can you let me drive around the parking lot?\" or \"***ask for advice about cars**\"\n\nHe: **Just laughs** calls me too stupid, says it's not worth his time, or tries pulls low blows (ex. references the time i used to SH in middle school and he'd say \"i won't let a self mutilator behind the wheel\" :| (dw i im not longer suicidal)) \n\nThe driving school itself doesn't offer rides, i know some do but my local doesn't. Besides, a prerequisite for this school  is already having a learners permit. I tried calling an uber to take me to the DPS (to get a permit) and my dad became very angry, got in my face and forced me to cancel the ride/give up my appointment. \n\nI just wish i could count on him, i wish he'd help me.\nI wish i could have a different dad all together who is supportive, has even an ounce of self awareness and empathy. :/\n\nI feel stuck. Literally and physically. Im not sure what to do. Tagging this as advice because i would really appreciate any."

For a causal relationship to exist between two variables, one must influence the other; when one variable changes, it must bring about a change in the other. The variables, therefore, have a causal link.\u00a0",

Man things always get out of hand, I now have again time to dedicate for the job but I'm not wanted anymore.\n\nI was told to put my life together and go back with a plan on how I'll do things right, but I feel so discouraged, I'm not sales experienced, I'm not a business person yet, I'm a very alone person trying to get out of my comfort zone.

I worked hard to get out of there, I saved what I could(not mucch) and took a flight to the farthest city possible and started a new life, got a 9 to 6 job, made couple friends.\n\nI try my best everyday, but I lack so many things that I'm afraid of taking more responsibilities.The company I work with sells Real Estate, they all so wealthy and confident, and I'm an assistant, I sort of know I should be looking to become a seller and find clients for myself, to earn comissions.\n\nBut I don't know how to do it with no network, not much energy/time left after work, no car (I don't even know how to drive, yes I'll take lessons) not much money yet, I'm working on it.  \n\n\nProblem is every time I think on cold calling or posting properties **I freeze up and think clients will look down on me for all that I lack**.

How can I grow up in Real estate at this point?what is the correct way to ask for help? where should I look for help?"

Also her conversation with Chishiya was personally very unexpected for her to approach Chishiya and start a conversation with him.

The game felt out of place in the live action because it was a live action original and was terribly inaccurate to the difficulty. It's 3 of clubs not a 8 of diamonds. Also like I said earlier, Arisu isn't academically smart, he's just a dude with a massive EQ and is a hearts player and that was one of his charms because it's a very refreshing for a character to be emotionally smart and not just unrealistically smart at school.\n\n4.

Among other things, I want to push kids to learn to think critically and I try to support them as much as possible in that. I really want to help them succeed, but when a student just doesn't care, doesn't do any work, and rejects my attempts to help them, I don't get too torn up when they don't do well.\n\nWhat really eats at me, though, is when a student works hard but it's just not clicking for them and it feels like there's no progress being made at all. I teach math, and I find it's not uncommon for a student to be a hardworker but not really be able to understand the material. What's worse is when a student (or their parent) feels like they have to hire a tutor just to get them to get a decent or better grade. It makes me feel like I failed them and that I could have explained things better in class, maybe my expectations are too high, maybe my whole teaching style is bad and needs to be revamped, etc. I just feel like it's my job to teach them, and if I'm not enough to teach it to them, then I failed at what I'm supposed to be doing.\n\nAnd I like to think that anyone has the potential to develop great critical thinking skills and learn how to understand the content, but sometimes I feel like, at some point, maybe the concepts are just a little too hard for some people, idk. I just wanted to see if anyone else ever feels this way, too.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments helping me shift my perspective! If nothing else, at the end of the day, I want the student to do well, and if a tutor helps them do that, that's a good thing. And it's also more about the parents wanting their kid to do well than it is about me being a bad teacher. Not everything is about me!"

I wish there was a more meaningful decision between expanding more or focusing on growing your current cities. Sometimes I just don't want to manage a bunch of cities and it can be fun to just manage a few big ones and watch them become massive.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions for civs/game settings in Civ 6 where it doesn't feel like I'm just choosing the worse option by not going wide, I'll gladly hear them. But otherwise, I was wondering which installment of Civ is best for going tall, where you really feel like you can be making a reasonable choice by doing it. The only other one I've played was Civ 4 back in the day, but I don't remember it much, except that hexes are way better than square grids and unit stacking is awful, but I might be able to deal with those if it's really the installment I should play.\n\nAs a side note, any other 4X games that are good for going tall? I know it kind of goes against the expansion part, but idk."

Especially if the whole thing with the aqueduct is that it's preventing food loss because you still have access to water. Why in the world would the improvements be pillaged?\n\nWell, there's my rant. Am I the only one who wants this/thinks it should be a thing?"

I'm personally not sure if he has had different crushes over the years, (he's never directly told me), but I wouldn't be surprised if he did.

It has been a long time since then and I\u2019ve shifted my focus towards other instruments, but I kept the piano as a side hobby. These days, i only ever play contemporary music, and although it\u2019s fun, I want to start practicing more classical music. The problem is, I don\u2019t know where or how to start approaching learning classically, because up until now, I\u2019ve been practicing and learning by ear or by very limited sheet music. All the rhythms I play are quite simple and I\u2019ve never played anything more than like three-four minutes in length. How would you all advise making the shift from contemporary to classical??\n\nEdit: I know how to read sheet music because I play the violin classically now, (and I know how to read bass clef as well) but it\u2019s hard for me to interpret it as easily for piano? For some reason? \n\nThank you!!"

And then pop and nothing numbness, and it terrorized me so that I started researching again and found out that there is more to ADHD than the name indicates.  After being so happy for a moment the numbness felt too empty. \n\nSo I talked to a trusted friend told him about what I found out, and he responding from ignorance told me \"but you are not certified with ADHD you are looking too mych into this maybe you are autoinfluencing yourself?\" in part he was right I never went to a professional about my problems, but still in the moment that coming from him my most trusted friend felt like a kick in the guts, it destroyed me emotionally and I decided to maybe it is time to seek help.\n\nYesterday morning I talked to my mom about this telling her that I would go to the doctor today to see what I need to do to get a diagnosis in my country, telling her about my inability to concentrate omiting the emotions part,she was super confused just about that  because I never talked about this to her.\n\nAll day yesterday  I was on edge and in evening I started crying and I'm still crying writing this, because I'm terrified, I all started with me being too happy then feeling nothing and now straight a sad mess for 24 hours without being able to stop feeling sad for nothing.\n\nI talked to my friend we solved things he was in a tight spot too, my mom accepted the stuff and today I'm doing to check out what I have to do.\n\nBut I don't want to get penalized like this my whole life like this every time I'm happy for once, going from 100 to 0 like nothing ever happened feels too damn cruel."

I ask this because I have 9 friends who follow back, but I particularly want to match with one special friend, and I\u2019m his only Duolingo friend. If he opens his app very early every Monday, does that mean we\u2019ll definitely match? (Assuming I haven\u2019t been matched by someone else that week)\n\n2. I\u2019m quite an over achiever on Duolingo compared to most of my friends. Can I carry the quest 100% without their contribution?\n\n3. If I\u2019m in diamond league, am I more likely to match with someone who\u2019s also in high league, than someone who is in silver and missed the study for quite a few days?\n\nI appreciate maybe some questions can only be answered by Duolingo developers. But would be great to know more people\u2019s observations. Very excited about the new feature!"

He was the one who inspired me to research the LGBTQ community, since he's pansexual. I also discovered myself in those Wiki pages. When I did, I came out to him as nonbinary and pansexual at the time. He appreciated tht I wanted to know more and accepted me for who I am. Then, life got in the way. T moved away a couple times; now in a neighboring state. I was basically kicked out of my parents' house and eventually moved as well. I came a few other times as demisexual, Achillean, and a demiboy. We decided to exchange Snapchat codes and messaged each other as friends. Well, until a week ago. He has expressed strong feelings for me and I feel the same. We passionately miss each other and wish to make up for lost time. Ever since then, we've been flirting hard. Like, to the point of sharing fantasies.\n\nThen, there's D. We met on Discord April of this year. For a while, I did not DM him again until probably August, when I got my new computer. Since then, we've been flirting cutely and bonding over our state's memes.\n\nThey know of each other, but only by name and how I met them. T is accepting of me being polycurious. However, D, not so much. He has expressed a twinge of jealousy when I showed him a Sim I made of T, so I don't mention him when talking to D. I find D sweet, but I don't see him in the way I see T.\n\nThe bad thing with me is tht I compare the three of us. T is \\_\\_\\_\\_, while D and I aren't, T is this, while D is not, etc. It's a toxic cycle. And, it almost seems not fair tht I'm not sharing my feelings equally with both of them. I don't know if I'm really cut out for polyamory. I mean, I've always imagined myself with one man (or perhaps someone of another gender), but I've looked through my past and my strongest crushes usually come in pairs. \n\nIs this normal when polycurious? Any thoughts on the matter? It has left me feeling drained."

I have an RCA to 3.5mm adapter and then a 3.5mm to 1/4inch adapter, so I connected my sub out on the MX3 to the input on my bass amp. I used the EQ on the amp to turn the mid and treble down and the bass up.\n\nWhat can I say? It works. It may not be the clearest, I wouldn't know, but a bass amp is built for low frequencies, and I have the volume at a reasonable level, and it still outputs well.\n\nI have two bass amps that I use. The Fender Rumble 15, which I do not recommend. It sucks. I also have the Fender Rumble 25. This is the good one. It is only an 8-inch driver, but it is front ported. It is also $119 [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Fender-Rumble-Bass-Combo-Amplifier/dp/B00HWINLAE/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=fender+rumble+25&qid=1615087786&sr=8-2).\n\nIt is obviously not meant for this kind of use, and I will not push it too far. I don't listen to loud volumes anyway. How bad of an Idea is this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPre-publish edit: I did the most basic of frequency response tests, where I went to a tone generator and just moved the slider to different frequencies, and I noticed that it basically disappears below 50hz. Not what you want for a sub. I think it was a good thought, but it was not successful, so bad idea. Do not recommend."

As a child, my mother and I were homeless quite often. I would mostly play by myself, I preferred to be alone with my thoughts. I spent a lot of time exploring outdoors and trying to create new things. I always had some sort of science experiment going or some book I was reading. I was a very quiet kid. My mom tried to get me to go to church but I hated it, I didn\u2019t believe in God and found no point in going to church even as a young child. I did, however, go to church as a teenager because of my friends bringing me and I did end up converting many years down the road. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nRight now I work remotely as an office administrator. I like it because I can work when I feel like it and I am basically my own boss. The downfall is the job itself is pretty boring. I would like a job that I could really grow in, learn and experience new data every day. \n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI would absolutely love it. I am the mother of 3 small children and I crave alone time. Even before my family life began, alone time is huge and essential for me and my mental state to be healthy. \n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI do enjoy hiking. I enjoy being outdoors mostly by myself because it gives me time to think. I played tennis in high school and was really good at it, but over all I\u2019m not good with sports at all. \n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI am constantly thinking of new ideas. I do a lot of day dreaming. One reason I love working from home is it allows me to take several breaks throughout the day and just research on whatever topic has peaked my interest at the time. My interests are constantly changing. I am always thinking of different ideas on how to do things. For one small example, the other day my husband and I were out eating dinner at a buffet the other day and I couldn\u2019t help but sit and day dream about the improvements the owners could make to streamline the process and make it a much better experience for their customers. I\u2019m always thinking about how things can be better and what could be done to make things better. I always think about science and how things work and why. I\u2019m an extremely curious person. \n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI can be a good leader, I like to give my input on how things can be done. Usually in a group situation if I see that someone has already taken the leadership role, I will watch to see if it\u2019s being done well. If I feel that that leader isn\u2019t being a good leader, I will step up and do the leading. I have always said that I\u2019m a leader, not a follower. \n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI am very clumsy. My head is always in the clouds. My mother used to tell me that I would lose my head if it wasn\u2019t attached. I trip over things regularly because I\u2019m always in my head thinking about other things and not paying much attention to my surroundings. I do like to \u201ctinker\u201d but I wouldn\u2019t call myself really skilled at anything with my hands. \n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI don\u2019t consider myself artistic but I fully appreciate music and the beauty of art. Sometimes I do struggle with meaning behind art, but I can appreciate its beauty. I have always wanted to learn an instrument but I lack the motivation to stick to it, I wish I had more longevity in my ambitions. \n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI think this is a tough question, but I\u2019ll do my best to answer it in the way that I\u2019m interpreting what it\u2019s asking. The past can\u2019t be changed, so I don\u2019t spend a lot of time dwelling on anything that\u2019s already happened. I do really enjoy thinking back on good times in my life and remembering certain things with rose colored glasses. The present is probably the toughest one for me to describe, I wish I lived more in the moment. I do think that I spend more time day dreaming and thinking about things than I do actually appreciating what\u2019s really happening in the moment. The future is an exciting thought for me, because I can see a lot of great possibilities. I love thinking about things that could be. \n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nWhen people ask for help with something, I usually say yes the first time or two. But if I see a pattern where this person asks for help too often in my opinion, then I start saying no. Also, if I see this person has asked many people for help with things before coming to me, I\u2019ll say no, because I see them as someone who is using people. I very much value people who can take care of themselves and don\u2019t ask for help very often. \n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nAbsolutely. I think if I could pinpoint one major theme in my life, I would say that I am constantly looking for inconsistencies every second of every day. \n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nIt\u2019s very important to me, but my problem is I can easily come up with plans to be efficient and productive, but it surely does not always happen. I can get stuck in the planning for efficiency process and have trouble with seeing it through. \n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nSometimes I do think of myself as a bit of a control freak when it comes to my immediate family, mostly my home life. I think it\u2019s because I can be a bit of a perfectionist about certain things. I want to make sure my kids are always safe and well looked after, so certain rules need to be followed in order to achieve that. I\u2019m also a very easy going parent, and I can struggle with follow through. In situation outside of my home life, I am not controlling of others whatsoever. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI like spending my time researching whatever topic I\u2019m currently into. I like gardening because it\u2019s fun watching things grow and change. I watch a lot of documentaries and reading because learning new information is like breathing to me. I like to play table top games with my husband because I like to strategize and friendly competition. I play chess as well. \n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI earned my degree all online because I liked the atmosphere of independent study. Keeping up with the structure of a traditional class is usually tough for me. I believe when it comes to learning styles, I learn best by reading and listening. \n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go? \n\nI definitely wing projects but they always get done well because I work well under pressure. By pressure I mean I wait until the last minute to do it. I can strategize theoretically, but following it through is a problem when it comes to doing the mundane practical life errands etc. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI would love to work for myself for all of my working years and make a decent wage. I don\u2019t really care about having the best of everything, but making enough to take care of my family and to travel. I am the type of person that could live on very little and be perfectly happy as long as basic needs are being met. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI have a few fears. My biggest fear is about getting to the end of my life and realizing I didn\u2019t live up to my full potential and that I didn\u2019t do anything with my life. I also fear losing one of my children. Despite being a devout Christian, I still fear getting old and have a fear of dying. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nThe best moments of my life so far have been when each of my children were born. My kids mean everything to me, they are my greatest life\u2019s work. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nThe lows in my life are the times that someone very close to me has died. \n\n\u2022\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI would say that I\u2019m not very attached at all. I am always in my head and thinking about something other than what\u2019s happening right in front of me. \n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nI would probably be thinking about the various ways to get out of the room and how long I\u2019m supposed to be in the room. I would probably be imagining the person coming in the room to tell me when the time is up and how I would respond to them. \n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI take a very very long time to make important decisions. My decisions can change based on any new information I may receive. \n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI don\u2019t feel like I understand my emotions very well. I have a very hard time processing them. Emotions are like a foreign language to me. \n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nSometimes I will because I don\u2019t have the social energy to argue. But most of the time, I usually say what I\u2019m thinking if I see an inconsistency in their statement. \n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nSometimes I break rules if I don\u2019t see a real point in the rule to me. It has to make sense, if I see some sort of manipulation happening then I won\u2019t follow the rule. I do think that authority should be challenged."

As an estimate, my medical assistance in dying should take place next year in 2023. I have incurable illnesses, incrementally decreasing quality of life and I will qualify for this process.\n\nIn view of my final days, I am hesitant to reveal any of this information to friends and family. I know for a fact they will try to interfere with this process. So I want to leave them out of any knowledge of this.\n\nSo I have chosen to not tell them about my final day, unfortunately. In my opinion it would bring greater pain and conflicts within my relationships if anyone knows my life will end next year and therefore will bring strain on my friends and family.\n\nSince my friends and family will not know when I die, how can I soften the blow of my \"sudden\" death for them? Any ideas? In estimate, I have a year to figure this out so I have some time. \n\nI have tried to search for MAiD or Dying With Dignity groups to seek support on this topic, but I cannot find any except for this subreddit, which is slightly related to my questions.

So the very next day after the explosion happened, I left my family\u2019s home, despite repeated and aggressive gaslighting from all members of my family.\n\nSince I live in the same city as my family, I think LC or grey rock will work best until I decide to go NC. I plan on moving very far from my family in 1 or 2 years, depending on how my rent inflates and my savings go. My game plan is to gradually go NC once I move provinces.\n\nIn the meantime, grey rock or LC is my plan as I work to shave off my enmeshed and codependent relationship with my mother (and family by extension). The problem is, I don\u2019t know the difference between LC and grey rock.

The nuances and experiences of those 2 types are very relatable for me. But I\u2019m not concerned about relatability, I need accuracy.\n\nI\u2019m very familiar with the cognitive functions. Also, I often get a tie or 50-40 on Ti vs Fi on online tests and personal self-assessments.\n\nI\u2019m tired of being indecisive for years and would like to end this frequent confusion. Back to the drawing board!\n\nAbout the functions in which I lack proficiency, I believe my Te and Fe levels to be low. I\u2019m trying to improve my Te with intention and care, and have improved this in my personal psychotherapy sessions. With regards to Fe however, yikes I clash with Fe big time. Therefore, surprisingly, I don\u2019t get along with Fe-doms (although I\u2019m sure they\u2019re super sweet).\n\nSo my question to you all: have you been tied between INFP vs INTP? How did you clarify which function is your dominant? Please explain :-) Thoughts and experiences will be much appreciated.

I've been lurking for a while and finally decided to ask some questions...\n\nFor context, I've been on T for about 8 months, and my husband (cis) and I are talking about trying for a baby. He wants to start in the next 6 months (October) - but I'm thinking maybe December, which would put me at a year and a half on T. Tbh I really want my hairline to square out a bit more first - and just generally get as many changes as I can. I'd love to hit 2 years on T, next June, but he's wanted a baby since we got married 7 years ago so I don't want to keep him waiting TOO much longer, y'know?\n\nAnyway! I was wondering what kind of changes I should expect when I do go off T. I know my voice and extra hair are permanent, but that body fat and muscle can change back - but I can't find any information on how quickly that happens.\n\nMy face has become more angular and I actually LIKE the way it looks - finally lost the roundness I always hated. So I'd definitely love to keep those changes, as well as the increased neck thickness. And I REALLY don't want to lose my upper body muscle! I've always struggled to gain muscle in my arms, and it's also helping with my shoulder problems (improved stability as a result of more muscle).\n\nI'm sure it varies depending on the individual, weight changes during pregnancy, how long you're off T before becoming pregnant, etc., but literally ANY sort of idea of what to expect would do wonders for my anxiety.\n\nIf you read all this - thanks for your patience. And thanks in advance for any reaponses."

I have expressed my feelings for her on more than one occasion, and both times she had said she feels the same way but isn't ready to be in a relationship. Fast-forward a couple months and she starts taking interest in other people, particularly men who go to her school. First time she fell for somone she would try to get my advice on stuff about him (how to talk to him, how to be less awkward, and general venting when he doesn't act the way she wants). Eventually she got over him and actually became sour with him because apparently he had \"a toxic personality\" (I didn't know the guy in person, and she never went into detail about what drifted them apart. But she hasn't spoken kindly of him since). A couple months later she vents to me about being rejected for the first time from a diffrent guy. This time I told her that her talking about that stuff with me makes me super upset and uncomfortable because it feels like she's rubbing salt in a wound. She said she understood and didn't continue the conversion any further. Now acouple days ago she sends me a message asking if she could vent and I said of course. She immediately responds saying she sent it to the wrong person and that she doesn't want to vent to me because she knows I \"don't like it when (she) talks about this stuff\". Now today she posted on her Instagram story that whatever guy she was talking to doesn't want her. I'm honestly tired of hearing about this. I still like her a lot, and I feel like I put in a lot of effort to check up on her and keep her happy. But if she keeps chasing other men, should I still keep up with her? Is there a way for me to win her over, or should I just move on? And if it's the latter, how do I do that? I don't want to just ghost her, but talking to her with the thought of \"we will only ever be friends\" is really painful."

The following questions and answers have been taken from the latest session, in which the typist came back INTJ. However I still wonder if I might be a Ni strong ISTP or INFJ. More or less on the Ni-Se perceiving axis but figuring out tribe functions. I am open to any and all conjectures and understandings and will accept the outcome regardless! \n\n\n\n1. What things in life pull you back? (in the sense of things you struggle with) A distaste for vulnerability. If I dont enough knowledge on a subject I won\u2019t say speak on matters so as not to make a fool of myself. Sometimes I get stuck with some crippling self doubt and impostor syndrome where I feel as if I\u2019m supposed to be to a certain level. I really never want to look stupid or unknowledgable around people. Sometimes I get stuck trying to create the perfect formula as I want everything to go perfectly; which is never how life works out an I need to learn that. \n\n2. What stresses you out and upsets you? People who are very \u201cgo with the flow\u201d and make decisions about things last second. A string distaste  for indecisiveness and people who need to ask others and not just do it. I also dislike being in an emotionally charged environment with people you have to tip toe around their sensibilities. I dislike validating other people and you should never come to me if you\u2019re looking for someone to rub your stomach and tell you it\u2019s going to be ok. That\u2019s not me. I dislike incompetence and I hate relying on someone I consider a weak link. I hate when people assume that you have no emotions just because it\u2019s internal and not external. People are idiots who assume Fe equals high EQ. when live in an age were it\u2019s assumed that people who express the most feel the most and stoics like myself must be horrible psychopaths. I dislike hollow, \nDisingenuous behavior such as I hate social convention where you\u2019re forced to ask someone how their day is when in reality you don\u2019t care. When I was younger I was very much asocial and I hate it when \u201cpopular\u201dpeople would come up and try to talk to because I assumed they they looked down on me and were only doing it to look like good people. I guess this shows my burning hatred of Fe. People who reason with feeling catch my ire. \n\n3. What are you like when you aren\u2019t having the best day? I can more or less keep it to myself. When I\u2019m not in a good mood I\u2019m kind of an asshole but I can keep it under wraps unless someone decides to try me. I\u2019m fairly good about keeping my own emotions in check and it helps to talk to one of my close friends so I can vent to them. When I was younger I used to bottle up emotions to the point of having outbursts over the littlest annoyances  \n\n4. How would your close friends describe you? Stoic, intelligent. Pretty cold when someone\u2019s trying to get to know me. I\u2019d venture even to say maybe a bit rude. They\u2019d say that unless I know someone I tend to be very stiff and formal. That is until I warm up to the person and I tend to be more talkative and joking around. If you\u2019re my friend and I have vetted you as belonging to my close circle then there\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for you and vice versa. I tend to be extremely discerning and judge mental and critical when it comes to who I allow myself to associate with. I have a small group of close and constant friends. I could never have more than maybe 6 friends and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \n\n5. How do you see the world? (E.g. you see it in a bright light etc) I tend to have somewhat fatalistic, pessimism bordering on nihilism view of the world. Philosophy is an interest of mine and I\u2019m sadly drawn to more negative ideologies. I\u2019m a sad idealist ultimately. I once saw potential. I\u2019m dismissive of virtues and see it for what it truly is. Ultimately people are out for number 1 but can be unconscious about why they truly do things. Even the the most \u201caltruistic\u201d of intentions is somewhat selfish in that maybe whether you realize it or not you want people to think you\u2019re good person. I veer more towards Hobbes than Rousseau and Locke and I think he was kind of right that humans need someone to impose order on them for they are too weak willed to govern themselves. I want to judge and look at the world objectively but humanity often lets me down. I can be very misanthropic towards humanity. \n\n6. Would you described yourself as ambitious? Why/why not? Oh most definitely. I\u2019ve had a set of ideals and visions of what I want my life to be since I was little. I\u2019ve deviated very little from that path. When I was younger I set up a times table of where I should be in life and how I\u2019d go about achieving my endeavors. I am a torrent river braving and meandering the flow against the rocks and rapids. I will brave the currents to flow into a greater body of a vision and understanding. \n\n7. What things are you good at and why do you think makes you good at them?\nI\u2019m good intellectual things and digesting large sums of information and bringing vin ew thoughts and takes to add upon them. I don\u2019t enjoy tooting my own horn so this question may be difficult. I\u2019m not one to jump up immediately to take charge, but if it becomes too chaotic I have no problem assuming being the leader of a group in any situation. I can make a fairly good leader if put my mind to I have been head or part of the ruling body of clubs and organizations I\u2019ve been apart of. I think I\u2019m good at breathing life into goals and making them reality. People don\u2019t have an understanding of locus I\u2019d control and how much they dictate their reality. I\u2019m so sick of people blaming life and others for their misfortunes. \n\n\n\n8. Why do you think are human \nrelationships necessary in life? \nAgain I\u2019m very choosy about who I allow to get close to me. For me I\u2019m a bit of a perpetual loner and I enjoy having the freedom of coming and going as I wish and not having to take into account other people in the decisions I make. I\u2019m fine with being single and it doesn\u2019t bother me in the slightest. I\u2019ve had people try to shame me into having romantic relationships in the past but I\u2019ve made it very clear I for the most part don\u2019t want one because my tolerance for human bullshit is very very low. I still think relationships such a familiar and platonic friendships are important. I\u2019ll admit I still need someone but my need to socialize is very low. \n\n9. What\u2019s important to you?\nLiving up to the standards of conduct that I have made for myself. I can be very self critical when I don\u2019t live up to them. I have a strong desire to achieve my end goals and I was always part of the high achieving students in both high school and now currently college. I see the life I\u2019d want to live and will fight tooth and nail against the rise of adversity to see it into reality. Intelligence and strong moral character are incredibly important to me I will never give an inch and comprise my values and what I believe is right or wrong for anyone. I have no problem holding my own against people and I tend to come off as a bit self righteous but I don\u2019t care. \n\n10. Would you say you understand \nyourself and your feelings well?\nI\u2019d say I understand my self and can pinpoint why I feel or think the way I do. Now whether I do anything about it is another topic but yes I know why I do the things I do. I have pretty good self awareness and because of that I can only ever blame my self and perhaps circumstance for any misfortune. While I tend to value ration and logic I still believe emotions have their place. I understand we all have emotions and even if mine are more internal I still have them and it\u2019s be foolish to ignore them. I tend to get my feelings out by writing novellas and poetry. I have a two or three moleskins worth of poetry and diary entries to fully flesh out what I\u2019m thinking and feeling. It always helps to write. \n\n\n11. What problems have you had growing up? I was never very social and my parents kept pushing me to socialize. I was a bit of a Know it all somewhat arrogant kid. I was the \u201cwell acktuly\u201d kid and I had no problem correcting the teacher and I could be down right alienating to my peers as I didn\u2019t have the understanding to know how I was coming off towards others \n\n12. Have you ever felt alienated? Why?in a strange way not really. I mean I chose who and who I wouldn\u2019t associate with. Despite what I said in the previous question, I was the kid or person that never said much but still was liekable. I\u2019ve always wondered how I can be that way and yet I\u2019d say a vast majority of people hold positive opinions on me. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone that even strongly dislikes me. I guess maybe I\u2019m not as bad as I think I am if I can still get a majority of people to like me. I was never perceived as \u201ccool\u201d (as if that means anything to me) until the end of high school. I was never seriously bullied, no more or less than the average person. I avoided any serious bullying by being just likeable enough to be left in peace. \n\n13. You have a whole day free, no \nresponsibilities. What do you do and why, considering the day before you weren\u2019t exhausted? In the past I had problems giving myself a break as I tend to be hard on myself about being lazy and letting my metaphorical hair down. On my days off I\u2019ll either run errands or read and introspect. I tend to read a lot about it things that interest me such as self help but also horror and historical novels.  Introspecting is very important to me as it helps me self reflect and figure why I feel the way I do and how to fix it. Growing up I was the responsible studious child to my younger sisters wild and passionate. I\u2019m better about buckling down and doing what needs to be done in order to live a more ordered life.  While my personal space tends to be cluttered my schedule and the way I compose myself are ordered. \n\n\t14.\tWhat are your toxic traits? Or what are you like when you are at your worst behavior? I can be arrogant and very much a self righteous know it all. I\u2019m not really afraid of condescending and being just an ass to someone\u2019s face. The worst part is I\u2019m very unapologetic and I almost never apologize unless it\u2019s very clear I\u2019m in the wrong or you\u2019re one of my close friends. I can be very verbally abusive and in a fight I go straight for someone\u2019s deeply held insecurities as I am using the power of being able to read a person and diagnose what their insecurities are for evil. I can be unpleasant when I\u2019m in a bad mood. When I as younger I used to explode in anger because I just didn\u2019t care. I was right and they were wrong I couldn\u2019t care less about actually exposing their rationale be I saw them as less intelligent and not worthy of rational analysis. \n\n\t15.\tWhat are some things you would like to improve on yourself? I could really try being less judge mental towards people I deem as incompetent as we all people who tend to be emotionally expressive. Being judge mental and kind of an asshole are probably one of my biggest flaws as I can come off as rude whithout meaning to. It\u2019s also hard to apply myself sometimes to things I deem as menial and pointless. If there a problem with myself it\u2019s important to me to figure out what it is and how to rectify it. Maybe being more sensitive and less unapologetic towards others. I can can being severely sarcastic and snarky towards people I don\u2019t agree with and when I was younger I had no problem airing out grievances. Perhaps less negative and cynical of virtue.? \n\n\t16.\tWhat are some of your qualities that you think would be useful to the society as a whole and why? I think could contribute best as a leader with a vision and the ability to use my constituent\u2019s abilities to the best of their ability. I think could contribute my intelligence and intellectual  know how. I\u2019ll be honest and say entry level menial jobs are a waste of my abilities. I can be conscious of how I would treat anybody working under me as happy workers are productive workers. Take care of them and they\u2019ll take care of you. I\u2019m good a problem solving and coming up with interesting unconventional solutions to problems which can put me at odds with traditionalists and cut and dried personalities. That being said I\u2019d rather work in the shadows than being the lead figure head as I\u2019m fine with being 2nd in command as long as I vet them as competent. \n\n\t17.\tWhy are you confused about your type? What stereotypes do you not fit into? What confuses you about it, etc.\nIf I\u2019m INTJ-Yea can be a self righteous know it all but I think if I\u2019m INTJ I have wetter understanding of where the lien is with people and not to cross. When I want to be I can come off as affable which is something most people in the community would never associate-with INTJ. I\u2019m also hate how people in the community draw lines between INFJ and INTJ. It basically goes Ni dom I like-INFJ vs Ni dom I don\u2019t like -INTJ. I think it\u2019s stupid and most of the bad stereotypes come from isfps pretending to be INTJs. INTJs irl are very different from these people. On the odd occasion I can be sensitive to people\u2019s needs if I care about them. I\u2019m pretty good at reading people\u2019s faces and I can tell when someone\u2019s having a bad day. I\u2019m still impervious to figuring out when people are romantically interested in me though. Reading about how INTJs are and what a lot of their childhoods where like I relate the most to INTJ. The last two people I had type me concluded INTJ decisively, but I still think there may be some margin for error as id like a wide sample group. \nIf I\u2019m ISTP- if I\u2019m an istp I wouldn\u2019t relate to be being gifted in sports with good hand eye coordinations and my interests tend to be cerebral as opposed to tangible. This could be because I\u2019m a dominant five and I know not every istp is james dean or Han Solo or Indiana Jones but still. I don\u2019t think istps or sensors in genes are stupid as I hate type exceptionalism. People often associate Se with athleticism and while I take the time to exercise every day I\u2019m not at an adrenaline junkies like most of the SPs I know. I have my moments which could be chalked up to Se grip but for the most part  I\u2019m not impulsive which is kind of an SPs trait."

I was in the backseat with my little brother and she didn't exactly answer me but she did nod her head. She has a history of not answering questions and then getting upset at me later because I didn't read her mind, but in this instance I didn't read her mind and I also was stupid enough not to ask for clarification. \nAnyways, when we got home I went to the park and then my mom texts me that I needed to do one chore before I went to the park, and to come home right away.  So I started heading back home when my bf (17m) texts me where I'm at, and that he's at my house and it sounds like my parents are screaming at each other. I ask him how bad it sounds and he said it sounds really bad. \nI hate it whenever my stepdad and mom fight because they often try to include me in their fights or blame it on me. Also it's just really stressful. So tbh, I really didn't want to go home unless absolutely necessary. I told my mom I'd do one chore when I got home and then went to hang out with my bf for a bit. (I let my mom know where I was at thru text, she never replied to any of my messages tho)\nI got home right at my curfew (8 pm) And when I got home my mom started yelling at me and saying I was grounded because I didn't come home right away. I told her that I didn't want to come home if her and my stepdad were biting each others heads off. She said that no matter what, if she tells me to come home I need to come home. She also got mad because my bf found out that they were fighting, which I don't know why that was even a big deal cuz when we were on vacation and my bf was there they got into a massive fight right in front of him and the cops ended up being called. (Noise complaint)\nShe ended up grounding me for two weeks because I argued with her. So what I'm wondering is, am I the asshole for refusing to come home? My dad says I wasn't in the wrong for it but my mom and stepdad think I was in the wrong. They also still blamed me for their fight because they were fighting about the house being messy and I was supposed to do a chore."

I learned this from my aunt, who told me she essentially called me \"unwanted\" and that since she had her unwanted pregnancy 17 years ago, that means every other woman out there should have their unwanted pregnancies too. \nShe has told me time and time again that I was an \"accident.\" She says she loves and appreciates me, but far too often does the topic come up in a conversation where she talks about how I was a \"happy accident.\" She uses the word happy, but the word accident is still in there. And I never realized until the other day how fucking awful that makes me feel. How my whole life feels like a fucking lie. How she probably wanted to abort me, but decided to take her version of a moral high ground and have me. I can't explain it but knowing that hurts so fucking much. it hurts me to my core. knowing she could've just not had me, knowing she at the time HAD A CHOICE, while uterus owners nowadays may not have a choice any time soon, and she still decided to have me and now I'm just here. I'm here to pick up the pieces, I'm here to deal with her shitty exes and clean up her messes, take care of her children she needed so desperately. It hurts so much I can't even begin to describe it. I'm not happy."

My grades were so bad, I would need to retake 5 classes and enter an MS program to make me more qualified for medical school. Even then it wouldn't be a traditional route. \n\nLooking at the worst of my grades was from when I spent all my time appeasing an N in my life. For anonymitys sake, I'm just gonna say it's an N that's a family member.\n\nI started dating someone that my N didn't like. They whined about it, refused to talk to me about it if I wasn't going to break up with my boyfriend, and eventually made sure I never spent any time by myself after I started dating. I thought moving out would give me space and time to myself but that didn't change after moving. Constantly blew up my phone had to know my schedule (I made the mistake of giving my class schedule one time ), called me during class, pitched a fit and blew up my phone and email more when I told them I had a lot on my plate with school and I needed some space. \n\nThen I just started appeasing them. Came when called, spent hours doing all these super non productive things, and had to make sure they were in a decent mood to finally let myself out to go back home. I barely had any time to myself and it was incredibly hard to cram in all my work after all that time was gone. \n\nThings finally blew up one week when my boyfriend and I had a fight. We decided that we just needed a little time apart to collect ourselves and come back together. Upset I called N for support and they pounced on the opportunity to get me to break up. They were nicer than they ever were to me in my life up until I changed my phone number and moved all my stuff back home. Then it was business as usual, hovering over me, pitching a fit when I didn't want to spend all my time with them, and treating me like they always did... I realized that I was being manipulated to come back to their environment and I finally confronted them that it wasn't right and I will stay with my boyfriend. \n\nLong story short, I just packed up my stuff and left for good. And we're NC now. Lots of crying and yelling and throwing my things on top of that. It took years to get over that and be functional again. This entire time I had to juggle a rigourous course load, research and all my volunteering that you have to do for your applications.\n\nMy biggest regret was not just putting my foot down and just going NC the moment I moved out. Me trying to save my relationship with N severely limited my chances of getting to medical school. I'm still going to try and make it happen, cos I don't want this to defeat me, but none the less I mean devastated and angry at myself and angry at the situation I had to (poorly) navigate. \n\nThanks for listening y'all"

Se ha llegado a varias conclusiones. Una de estas es que estamos cansados del contenido proveniente de la app \"Tik Tok\". Aunque no considero que todo el material importado de esta aplicaci\u00f3n sea mediocre, es cierto que en su mayoria es de una calidad bastante pesima.\n\nQuiero volver a los tiempos en los que ibamos 3 meses por delante a Tik Tok en cuanto a bromas y memes. Cuando Tik Tok solo eran las sobras de memes que llevaban mucho tiempo muertos. \n\u00daltimamente parece que nosotros nos hemos convertido en el vertedero.\n\nSoy consciente de la cantidad de factores que han influido en nuestra situaci\u00f3n actual. Algunos de ellos no han sido nuestra culpa ni son nuestra responsabilidad. Pero eso no significa que debamos rendirnos. Tenemos que hacer todo lo posible por levantar nuestro hogar.\n\nHay peque\u00f1os actos que pueden ayudar: \n-No hagas repost hdp\n-No posteen pensando en cuantos upvotes conseguir\u00e1s. Postea estando seguro de que el material cumple con los valores y caracter\u00edsticas del humor cl\u00e1sico de esta comunidad.\n-Si es un video de Tik Tok por lo menos ten la decencia de quitarle la marca de agua. Es muy sencillo, copias el enlace de esa publicaci\u00f3n y te vas a una pagina que convierta esos links en archivos .mp4 \nEjemplo: https://ssstik.io/es?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_CV0E.nHz.JgdU0PUT2T4ltXCAbFXplf3lBWyagFxS9g-1630068483-0-gqNtZGzNAhCjcnBszQc9\nCreo que hablo por todos si digo lo molesto y anticlimatico que es ver el logo de esa app y darse cuenta en lo que nos hemos convertido cuando mi prop\u00f3sito era re\u00edrme.\n\nGestos como \u00e9ste ayudar\u00e1n a mejorar el reddit. Estos eran solo algunos ejemplos os invito a que hag\u00e1is vuestras propias sugerencias en las respuestas o en post independientes.\n\nProbablemente el gracioso que vaya a comentar mucho texto no haya llegado hasta aqui pero si ten\u00edas pensado decirlo, ahorratelo.\n \nSin nada m\u00e1s que decir se despide un autista de coraz\u00f3n."

Infact for me, these are the most unsafe cars we have in our country. \n\nWhile we either mock of defend these cars, we should watch and take note on how Suzuki is actually doing well with safety even for the cars like Alto!! \n\nIn the JNCAP ratings (Japanese NCAP) the recently launched Japanese version of Alto scored a decent 4 stars which we could never imagine for our Indian Alto!!\n\nPlease watch this video (Japanese but see the safety features):\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LZsb9nP7gM0\n\nAnd we literally get trash here. I get it these are cheap with good mileage but are they more important than our own life?? Especially when the accidents are increasing daily!!\n\nAtleast we as consumers should voice these concerns?? No??\n\nThe Government must note this and I propose that they must work on a reform where only the 2+ star cars are allowed \n\n\nEven if you're not satisfied, feel free to downvote me!!"

Want to know how I know?\n\nI have one; and we share quantum energy through our soul tie. \n\nA soul tie is a quantum entangled umbilical cord that you can share with your soul mate through long distances. \n\nNow, quantum entanglement is simply energy combined with matter, mass, electricity and the body that can be shared in many ways. \n\nMy preferred method currently is through quantum wormholes my soulmate and I make through energy particles we create through our psychic abilities. \n\nDuring my spiritual awakening three and a half years ago I thought I completely lost my mind. \n\nHowever, I found G.O.D. instead. \n\n I suffered many medical problems, including an inability to regulate energy properly from my lack of oxygen when my mother suffered placenta previa, an inability to breathe properly because of underveloped lungs from being born months early and a heck of a lot of dark energy in that god forsaken hospitaI I was born in. My medical problems combined with my inability to regulate energy properly made it hard for my brain to gather enough energy to keep my body alive. \n\nSo it did what every body does to survive, it regulated me through my oversized amygdala. \n\nI spent twenty seven years that way, in and out of the hospital consistently as a child. Constant panic and anxiety attacks, parental abuse from not so wonderful generational familial ties - so on and so forth. \n\nThanks to my Mother, Father, Sister, Brother and two adorable nephews. My Soul children and I  finally figured out how everything is Truly connected.\n\nIt's \"love\" you dummies \u2661. \n\nThat includes aliens of course, you beautiful souls you. \n\nAliens are also connected to us through energetic frequencies. These frequencies for each soul is entirely unique to the person. Depending on the DNA of a person, the energetic frequency can be altered through Light Codes or what the more alienistic people prefer to call \"Plieadian Codes\".\n\nPlieadian coding is created though life energy or as most people call it light energy. The scientific term is light matter. \n\nLight matter and dark matter also known as light energy and Dark energy is vital to the human genome. The emotions, mind, spirit and body are all regulated through energy a.k.a. \"chakra\". \n\nNow, there are many religious factors that go into the spiritual side of things that I honestly don't feel like going into but basically aliens are completely and utterly real and can be explained completely through scientific theory as long as all twelve sides work together. \n\nI have what we in spiritual community like to call a \"Soulmate Contract\". This was created through my energy field before I was born in the draconian star system. In my past life before I came to earth I was a Lyran Princess that died before she was able to be born. \n\nNice to meet you all officially. \n\nSometimes I go by Zuen<3 (That's my alien name). \n\nHappy travels and Godspeed, Galactic Federation~"

However I have noticed a slight difference between how we fee. They seem to constantly \"long\" for me and think about me all the time, and I just really enjoy being around them and would like to spend more time around them if possible, but I'm fine on my own as well if I have to and don't feel as \"obsessively\" (I don't think that's the best word but can't think of another one atm) about them.\n\nAll of that has led me to believe that I may fall under the romance-positive aromantic classification. And I'd just like your perspective on that 7 months later. Do you still think that makes sense? Is this something you can relate with?

Is there any other limitations to the spell aside from spell slots and components?

And the idea of that makes me happy.\n\nBut then I think about my parents, and the fact that they've been paying for my studies since I was 10 (before that I went to public school), and even now when I'm 19 they're paying for my college, and I can't even get a job to help them because I study full time.

I know they don't expect that from me, and that they've always supported me because they're good parents and they love me, but I still can't get rid of this feeling. \n\nI don't even know if I should get rid of it, because maybe I do owe them something.

There is no current triage from between customer request and me spilling hours and hours of time trying to make what they want happen, but my company is trying to fix that.\n\nI guess I just never know, since I've been disregarded and cast aside for less at many companies. I'm trying my best but there are plenty of times where my best hasn't been good enough in the past, so it's an uncomfortable place to be.",

You sound very levelheaded and respectable to me, just aggravated, which is valid.\n\nI haven't been in the casual dating game for 10 years, so grain of salt and all that, but of course you're looking for what the other person brings to the relationship if you're going on a date. If you're always paying, that's fine, but then you're going to be more curious more quickly what the other person is bringing to the table. Is she offering to cook sometimes at least? Pay for a movie every now and then?\n\nI'll say, when I was dating my husband, we were both early 20s and fresh out of college. He's 3 years older than me, so, when I graduated into unemployment, he had a stable income and housing already while I worked temp jobs for the first 3 months and had a bad house situation for a while until I saved up enough to get my own place. In that time, I cooked dinner if he didn't feel like paying for us to go out. He didn't want me paying, but I wanted him to know I wanted to contribute some other way. Looking back, we probably wouldn't have dated at all if we hadn't been friends for years before that where we went out and each paid for our own entertainment in a mutual friend group. He had a history with me to know I worked and could pay, and was just going through a rough patch at that specific time that meant I couldn't for a little while. If we'd met on a dating app though? God, no, I wouldn't have been looking to date ANYONE at that ugly point in my life, and he would've been smart to run from an unemployed, housing displaced new grad, lol.\n\nAnyway, I'm just saying dating is all about figuring out what each person brings to the table and there will be times you bring more or she brings more, but each should be putting in that effort everyday to get to 100% together. It's hard to establish that when you're just starting to date, but it'll happen! I would struggle so bad in the current dating scene figuring that out, so I'm glad I don't have to do that anymore.",

                "body": "These happened three separate times at the same grocery store near my house. All are at least a year ago, but I only realized recently that these are situations where people thought I worked there!\n\nFor context, we really like the self checkout setup at this store because husband can stand at the scanning station ringing up the items, and then a conveyer belt sends them down to me where I can bag them and put them in the cart after. It's super efficient with the two of us, so we really like doing this. Most other people we see are there alone, so they scan all their purchases first, and then walk down and bag everything up after. We're usually the only duo making quick work of it, but truthfully it's because we're both introverts, so we're moving fast to buy our shit and get the fuck outta there!\n\nCue the confusion from other people...\n\nFirst incident (short and anticlimactic):\n\nAn excited lady came up to me, smiling, and said, \"Wow! How do I get one of those?\" (Indicating to me bagging where everyone else has no one bagging for them)\n\nI think she's being conversational and I'm newly married enough that I'm still used to the weird things people say about marriage that make no actual sense to me, so I smile back, gesture to myself, and say something to the effect of \"Marry a good one!\"\n\nHer smile fades as she looks back and forth to husband and me, realizes we're married and I'm not the Grocery Bagging Lady, and then she glances around awkwardly while wandering off.\n\nI think the interaction is weird, but move on and don't think about it until the next two...\n\n\nSecond incident:\n\nWe're creatures of routine so you bet we're doing the exact same setup of husband scanning and me bagging. Right next to us are the smaller self scan stations, so the bagging area is right next to the scanner and it's ideal for people there alone with 15 items or less. Unfortunately, this is the height of lockdown in the U.S. and lots of places are getting short staffed, so the scanner can sometimes mess up and there's no staff member standing right there to help you. Cue this non-interaction:\n\nI'm much better now, but I've always had social anxiety, so big places with lots of people make me retreat even further into my head. Loud people only make that worse.\n\nA woman at the smaller stations is speaking loudly and aggressively, but I'm not listening because I'm busy, I hate being in public so I'm probably at my limit on interacting with others at this point, and also I just think some people are loud sometimes and I don't need to care so I don't. Our scanner needs some employee input too, so we're unfortunately just standing around waiting for someone to come clear the error just like loud woman likely is.\n\nI also have a problem with overwork (I know, I'm trying to cut back, I promise), so I take the opportunity to get on my phone and check work emails and probably fire off a response or two on whatever the hell project I have at the time. I'm still not listening to loud lady, but she's close enough that it's sort of obnoxious as she keeps speaking, but I'm absorbed enough in work shit that I tune her out as best I can.\n\nWork emails sorted, I distinctly remember avoiding looking her direction because she's loud and I'm really reaching my fuck-i-hate-being-in-public limit, but eventually looking behind me as I finally register she's aggressively trying to get someone's attention. Since I can tell it's directed a certain direction (totally missing it's at ME), I remember looking back behind me and only seeing the bathrooms and summer random patrons milling around.\n\nWeird, I think, who the heck is she talking to? There's no one over there. Oh well, not my problem, people are all sorts of strange, and I go back to Aggressively Minding My Own Business (a skill I am incredibly proud of, for the record).\n\nRight around this point, thankfully an employee appears, codes whatever thing our scanner needed and then walks over to aggressive lady next to help her. It's at this point, as I'm giving a sigh of relief that someone can help her and get her the fuck away from me, that I finally turn towards her as we're grabbing our things to leave that I see her point at me and (I assume, in hindsight) ask the employee if I work there.\n\nEmployee looks confused, I only half heard what she said because I was still Aggressively Minding My Business, but I stop and pay more attention seeing her finger pointing at me and now am giving them both my full attention.\n\nEmployee says no or shakes her head as I vaguely remember, but what I remember SUPER clearly is loud lady now just stares at me with her mouth open. (Legit just this face I see people throw all over the Internet: \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f) \n\nHusband's finished throwing the last few things in the cart and starts heading towards the exit, so I just smile at this random lady staring at me, no idea what the hell just happened, but leave.\n\nOnly in hindsight did I realize she was probably trying to get my attention all that time, but y'all I am talented at tuning things out. I'm from a huge family with 4 older brothers who were constantly getting into something, so I learned young to tune out chaos that had nothing to do with me. Also, real talk, people in the ghetto are taught to do that because no one has time to pay attention to every single thing going on around them, and I only notice people wanting to do that who grew up in safer neighborhoods. No problem, live your best life, but I want nothing to do with most situations, especially chaotic ones, because it benefits me in no way to get involved, and, if anything, can drag me into a bad situation instead, so I stay the fuck out of stuff.\n\n\nThird and so far last incident:\n\nYou guessed it, same setup as always at the conveyer self checkout! This woman was so nice, but good gracious I'm dense and she missed so many opportunities to realize her mistake, so this was a perfect storm of lol all around.\n\nWe're stuck with an error or input needed again with no employee in sight, so I'm on my phone while standing at the bagging part as usual doing, you guessed it, work emails again. I have a problem, I know, but get chastised enough for missing one godforsaken important tidbit buried in an email once, and it's easy to become way too attentive as an over correction. Anyway, this nice lady walks up to me and gives no context but says she needs help. She looks about my age, maybe only a little older, but I was frequently mistaken as being younger than I am, so that probably isn't helping me in these situations.\n\nI actually don't mind helping people anywhere if they come up asking for help, and since I'm stuck waiting anyway, I say sure and ask her what she needs. I honestly forget what her problem was all these months later, but I remember it was something where she too needed an employee, so I told her to stand at the station where employees usually are stationed and wait for someone. I say this with a smile, think nothing of it, and go back to work on my phone.\n\nI don't remember the exact way she asked for help again, but I remember I was typing a response to a coworker/boss and she interrupted me twice, so I was at first accommodating but the second time asked her to let me fire off work email first and then she could ask her question. This time she tries to lead me somewhere, and I vaguely register my husband saying my name to get my attention as I start going with her (in hindsight... Yeah, I was clearly mentally checked out to start following her).\n\nI stop, a little alarmed that my frazzled overworked brain was snapped to attention so aggressively, and husband tells me gently that she thinks I work there. He turns to say something to the lady, but I laugh and say, \"She doesn't think I work here! She just needs help. I'll be right back.\" I turn back to her with a smile and gesture to go ahead. Whatever she says ends is back up at the employee station where I tell her she needs to wait for an employee.\n\nI remember her mentioning something about how it takes so long for someone to come, and I gently reply that I'm sure they're understaffed like a lot of places are so we just have to be patient and we'll all get through it, etc. She then asks sweetly why I couldn't help her, and I genuinely still don't click that she thinks I work there, so laugh and say I probably could figure out their MS-DOS system if I tried! But y'know that's it because I still think we're just being conversational.\n\nHusband's still hanging out with all our stuff at our register, so since I can see we're not leaving any time soon, I hang out with the lady a bit and make what I assume is small talk while she's actually trying to genuinely figure out why I can't just do whatever thing she needs done. Because she's so nice about it, I think some of her questions are a little weird but just keep being a total dunce by thinking we're just chatting as two people passing the time in the same situation (\"Oh, what department do you work for?\" \"Oh, I do Job Description, which is really cool because...\")\n\nEventually, an employee comes and keys in whatever we needed at the register where husband has been patiently waiting, and I tell lady it was nice chatting or whatever and go to leave. It's at this point she asks, a little panicked, where I'm going, and I'm genuinely confused as I tell her I'm going home. Her mouth is a little agape as she says \"Home? Then who's going to help me?\" I tell her an employee will, and that I'm done shopping so that's why I'm going home. She keeps gaping as husband hands me my purse and jacket and I think she finally realizes (maybe, who in the world knows) and wanders off as I turn around and leave.\n\nHusband gently, again, tells me she thought I worked there as we're leaving, and I again laugh and go, \"Nooo, I don't have to work somewhere to help people!\"\n\nI realize typing this out that I must be an exhausting wife to keep up with sometimes, but he's very patient with my overworked brain.\n\nI also realize typing this all out for the first time that I stopped checking work emails over the weekend (what I was doing in these stories), but I was just answering work stuff at a friend get-together last night at 8pm on a Friday night and husband told me I've got to stop working after hours then too, and I responded in a huff saying I wish I could but boss this and that... I have a real problem, I finally realize. Ugh. Time for hard stops, my brain is always so dead these days..."

It's about a man who sleepwalks and one day he wakes up with blood all over his bed and his wife is missing. He has no idea what happened so he decides to strap an infrared camera to his shoulder to record while sleepwalking, thinking he might find out what happened to his wife. In the trailer we see footage of the infrared camera and at some point he picks up a young female hitchhiker, and that's all I remember."

So the quantity is not even an answer.\n\n\n\nLife is everlasting game of balancing risk and benefits. You go to work to get money, could get smashed by a car (suprisingly high chances). You go skiing, one of the most dangerous sports that exist. \nYou go mountain hiking risking all possible sources of serious injury and death.\n\n\nNow, these are all highly documented dangers of a day to day world, with relatively high probability of occurring. \n\nNow:\n\n\n1) HPPD occurs to max. 1% of people, most of whom got already genetic predisposition, so this is same case as trying psychedelics and the risk of schizophrenia. \n\n2)  it is not that well documented, and many psychiatrists doubt even its existence as it is described. (Not saying I doubt it's existence). Which means it is in a huge part purely anecdotal evidence.\n\n\n3) don't know how about you guys, but I am very rarely using anything, and each time, I believe, I gain much insight and perspective, hopefully making me a better man.\n\n\nSo the risk/reward ratio is not exactly that bad, especially having in mind mentioned risks of day to day life.",

I \"woke up\" in void state several times. I am pretty sure i was in void state, i felt like flying and my body vibrating, didnt feel the environment. Of course first thing that came to my mind was to affirm. When i said affirmations the vibrations got a bit intenser. But after a while they faded away. This happened to me multiple times, \"waking up\" in void state, saying affirmations but void state fades away by itself.

What makes these ads clever yet put together and understandable by the target audience? \n\n\nAn example is one hot sauce ad: a picture of just the bottle (with the brand label), with circular burnt marks on the table under it.\n\nWith only a photograph, no text, no explanatory slogan, they told the audience that their product is spicy in a quick and efficient way. How did they think of that?"

It showed a tanned kid with long blond hair who was paralyzed in the legs, and the show setting was maybe Native American. I remember it had something to do with the sun, like this child is a child of the sun, and he has been cursed with paralysis somehow. \n\n\nThe only scene I remember is maybe the title scene, where the child crawls up a cliff with a voiceover, and then the camera shows the sky and the title. What's the name of this show?"

He and the girl are alone in a dark building, he asks her questions but she keeps crying. He tells her that she was strong and made a brave decision but she still won't say a word. In the end he doesn't interrogate further, he sits on the floor beside her in silence. She pulls out her hand so he can hold it. \n\nIt was a very touching moment because it's like Batman was reconciling a kid who just went through the same trauma as him. What comic series/book was this from? Or was it fanart?"

It's also apparent in the makeup industry, and is caused by systematic inequality and misogyny. \n\nPs: I think the word was described with another word in the end, like \"the ... effect\" or \"the ... phenomenon\" but I could be wrong."
