I had been fighting back the tears during that whole time (locking myself in the bathroom to let it out intermittently). Then came the day when I was talking to my supervisor and the tears just started coming (still tried to keep a straight face, but what good does that do when you're choked up and clearly there are tears rolling?). First time she gave me a hug, second time she stood awkwardly and asked if I wanted to go home. I said yes, packed my stuff and left for the day. I worry about how this changed her perception of me and if I will ever be able to work there again.\n\nIf you have had a similar experience, it may help to know that you're not alone.

Gin knew about the Hades incident, so i think he was explained this in his first trial same as how Shin was explained how AI worked.\n2. In Your Turn To Shine (Kai's POV) [here](https://youtu.be/cWOzEz2ulu0) he has a fondness moment with Gin he said who he would bring to the island to survive he said **Kai because he knows how to cook and was a USEFUL GUY.** if you had to survive an island Kai out of all the characters would indeed be the most useful... but then who would be the most useful in the Death Game to have by your side? That would be Sara, so I think Gin genuinely loves Sara but he's also using her since she has the most chances of winning. Kai is really perceptive how he knew Keiji was hiding something back in chapter 1, he was surprised to Gin's answer:\n\n>K: \"...............\"  \n>  \n>G:\"Surprised by my cleverness\"  \n>  \n>K: \"Yes, surprised indeed (Quite the interesting child...)\".\n\nAlso in chapter 2 first part when Gin offers Sara 30 of his tokens (the 2nd time he offers them) and you accept he says **he will use Sara to play** or along those lines\n\ni think this will be touched next chapter definetly since there's no many characters left, the next following part will explores Gin's and Sara's\n\nalso remember when Midori said jokingly that Gin is a dark horse when he was explaining the 4 papers to Sara? i think this is obviously foreshadowing\n\ndark horse meaning/symbology:\n\n* a person who keeps their interests and ideas secret, especially someone who has a surprising ability or skill:\n* a candidate or competitor about whom little is known but who unexpectedly wins or succeeds.\n* A dark horse is a previously less known person or thing that emerges to prominence in a situation, especially in a competition involving multiple rivals, or a contestant that on paper should be unlikely to succeed but yet still might."

Keiji could still be with Megumi investigating or maybe they both had a confrontation for whatever reasons since we know they were both captured together. Keiji could not longer belong to the police (though i doubt it) and in this confrontation they were both captured.\n\nKeiji wishing for Sara to be in the game was already implied by Ranmaru, i think that was foreshadowing low-key and reason why Keiji is still alive and we get to know his either 1. investigation he did about ASU-NARO 2. a memory 3. his wish in the next part. I think that part 2 of chapter 3 wil require to find out stuff about ASU-NARO. Ranmaru says that independently of the game route you take so i think this line was important. This is somewhat Akin to Q-taro memories foreshadowing with him being the doll in the last update.\n\nKeiji the most probably didn't directly wished for it, but perhaps he wished to know the truth or \"I wish to know who was behind this\" \"I want to know the reason why, etc\". As in your turn to Shine it was implied that Sara was some kind of master mind and key figure to ASU-NARO. I also think Keiji knows at least some important facts about Sara and that's the reason he trusts her so much to the get  go, he already said he's not that calculating and has strong intuition but idk who knows. he usually shrugs it off saying she's cute, but what if he already knows her with some documents, lots of stuff could happen here, maybe even the percentages and he deduced she was strong.\n\nperhaps there's 2 Saras one is the real one, and the AI-doll Sara, the final confrontation would be with her doppelganger, only one of them living to see who's most fit to be the leader of ASU-NARO and the underworld.\n\nremember when Kurumada said that if you meet your doppelganger they die. what if Sara AI is supposed to be final floor master or maybe not (tbh i doubt it lol), but the Sara AI-doll could still be presented as a room master or as a watcher, we don't know for sure that the death game isn't being transmited live or being recorded even though Q-taro said he was watching for any camera.  all first trials were recorded and there wasn't any visible identifiable camera in the first trial room nor in others (kanna's room and the one who Keiji was investigating).\n\nmaybe Gin's mom is watching him and other people too, like Sara's dad, he's so sus (and obv Meister), paintings and other stuff (Gin's memories pen spy camera) could well be used as cameras or register the events that the Hades event replay since this is an important moment for the organization, maybe other important people of the organization could be watching this too.\n\nI think this will depend on the route you took, the Logic route could be more crude and more revealing about ASU-NAROs organization and cannot escape the game. In emotion route you could escape or viceversa. even though we know that the remaining participants will try to escape I think these scenarios would happen while investigating the locations and stuff necesary to get out of the game."

                "body": "Relevant part of Prospect\u2019s post:\n\n> One piece of what I consider abused or bad advice is pushing back anytime your boss wants to give you a new task or change your workload or give you a stretch assignment. I often wonder what the pushback would even look like or what their jobs are. I see this advice a lot on reddit work subs. My jobs is basically 90% different than when I started, so I feel like this constant pushback, if done in real life, will just cause these people to get laid off. As a manager I also struggle more with giving out stretch assignments. I often pick smaller and less urgent versions of the stretch assignment so if the employee screws up, it\u2019s not a huge deal. I haven\u2019t had anyone ask for a huge raise because I gave them one stretch assignment (which is advice I often see in other forums) but I\u2019ve had people pushback with \u201cthis is a full time job\u201d or \u201ca team should be doing this\u201d and it often leads to discussing how at our competitors, these actually aren\u2019t FT roles or they are FT because they do parts manually that we have automated. Or they have 4X more customers so can afford to make it a FT role. Or they pay pretty low for that FT role. I find that there are a lot of myths out there about how intense some work is and how much competitors pay. For example, I got pushback on a project and was told that this could be a FT role. Said employee didn\u2019t know that I know that at one of our biggest competitors, the only reason it\u2019s a FT role is because they have people making $15-$18 an hour in lower cost of living states clicking through a bunch of stuff manually, whereas they make $80K and we\u2019d pay for someone to automate the mouse clicking parts.\n\nWeirdly, I think I agree with this, but think they\u2019ve got it kind of backwards \u2014 it\u2019s very common to see \u201cdon\u2019t do the work until you get the official promotion!\u201d on AAM.\n\nIt\u2019s probably field-dependent, too. I\u2019m in public accounting, and I\u2019m trying to imagine having insisted to management that I wouldn\u2019t lead an audit until I was promoted to senior. That\u2019s not how it works, at least at the firm where I work: your first couple of times as \u201cthe audit lead\u201d are usually with a more experienced person also on the job, to give you advice. That way, you gain experience on the tasks of leading an audit, and it becomes evidence that you\u2019re ready to move up to senior and do it routinely. In a job where roles and responsibilities are more mutually exclusive, though, I could see the majority AAM/antiwork perspective being a more reasonable response.",

I'm close-minded in being open-minded (because atleast I'm trying to shift). \n\nWhat do I do with that? How to shift? \n\nEven when I believed it the most and was so purely excited for shifting I got nowhere close. \n\nI'm losing the motivation and belief and I dont want to. I just don't kniw how to stop that. And dont be like \"change the mindset its so easy \ud83e\udd2a\" no its not? Sometimes I even feel, that shifting is real, but I'm not capable of it. And i know thats bs but but hey, i didnt prove myself wrong yet lol\n\nHow to help with that? With having motivation even though youre failing? And no, imagining myself into my dr actually doesnt help, ive been doing that for a long time and nothing happened. \n\nId love answers especially from people who shifted and had similiar problems or someone who shifted after a long time? But everyone is welcomed to give some advices of course"

I finally settled on Soft Natural and have been happy enough experimenting within these lines for the last two years.\n\nBut I have been going through a crisis these last few weeks that makes me think I might have gotten it all wrong. I think I might actually be a Soft Gamine with a strong influence from the Natural family. And I'm wondering if anyone else is going through or has already experienced a similar crisis.\n\nThis all started after I watched A Star is Born lol. I know Lady Gaga is an FG, but there was something about her movements and her demeanor that I related to. I've also always loved Bette Davis's style and felt a kinship with her energy, but I never related to her younger photos. I've never been so slim.\n\nThis brings me to what I think is a big part in my confusion: I am 5'3 and have been on and off overweight since I was a child. Obviously, this experience skews my self-perception. I've NEVER thought of myself as dainty or small. I have a large bust, wide shoulders, and fleshy arms. (Like truly, tailored sleeves are the bane of my existence.)\n\nI know on Facebook our lord Kibbe has described an SN subtype called \"Spitfire SNs\"\u2014SNs who need some gamine influence. But there is a dearth of concrete advice on how to dress a gaminish SN, so I'm taking this research into my own hands.\n\nI've been tracking my wardrobe for a few months and am analyzing my favorite and most-worn pieces.  A lot of my favorite pieces fit within SN recommendations: folkloric embroidery, peasant blouses, square necklines, flowing sleeves, flared pants, flared sleeves, leather, casual hoodies, low-rise baggy jeans, etc. But a lot of pieces are also SG recommendations\u2014fitted, round collars; tapering at the wrists or ankles or elbows; high-contrast color and trim; bouffant-style dresses; skinny capris; cropped tailored vests; etc.\n\nThere are some SG recommendations that I think I look awful in (although this may be my own skewed self-perception). I don't think I look particularly good in American Apparel-style tennis skirts. I look very very bad in tiny puff sleeves and cap sleeves. I feel like I look constricted in too much tailoring, especially around the chest. I don't think sharp emphasis at the waist is my best look because I have a very short torso. I look very very bad in a gamine-style bob.\n\nBut I think I look worse in *fundamental* SN recommendations, especially in photos. In the mirror, I like my long, wavy hair, but in pictures, I see that long hair and long bangs drag me down. Flowing fabric drags me down. Slip dresses look awful and shapeless on me. Cowl necklines look sloppy. Necklines that aren't either high and round or low and square\u2014once again\u2014drag me down. Basically any non-cropped coat in existence...DRAGS ME DOWN. It's VERY easy for me to look matronly/dowdy, which are words that Kibbe actually uses A LOT in his book descriptions of what SGs should avoid lmao.\n\nSo why don't I feel like I fit into either category? Well....I have a STRONG hunch that this is all a result of Kibbe's Eurocentrism\u2014more specifically, his lack of verified Asian celebrities. (IMO Kibbe x Kpop is not a good resource past a certain age and a certain body fat percentage.)\n\nWhile I don't think I look different from a lot of Asian women, I do think I look slightly different from the American understanding of an SG or an SN. My theory is that it's all about the hips. I can see that most modern celebrity SGs are famously pear-shaped, and a lot of SNs have fleshy hips. But I think a lot of Asian women carry weight in their upper bodies and have slim hips\u2014this is definitely true for me. It's also true of my mom, who I believe is a true Natural (leaning towards FN). And we all know how Kpop idols wear hip pads...right?? This asymmetry is what made me first explore FG, but I realized geometric sharpness is not truly flattering on me, and I need quite a bit of yin to make me feel like myself. And because I'm top-heavy and always have been, I automatically assumed I had width to accommodate (because, generally, I do have to accommodate it!). And this is how I landed on SN.\n\nSo what am I really? Is it possible that I have to accommodate width, curve, AND petite? I will continue to explore what I believe brings out my truest essence. For now, I'm going to play around with SG. My new obsession is bouffant dresses\u2014ironically, they make me feel more adult!\n\nI would LOVE to hear that someone else is going through a similar thing. I'm in too deep in the Kibbe rabbit hole and have nobody else IRL to talk to about these very minor (but not insignificant!) details lol.\n\nAlso, I am totally open to learning that I am wrong about these types. If so, please let me know!! There is so much misinformation online, so I'd love to be corrected here on anything I said.\n\nEdited to clarify that I am speaking specifically as an East Asian woman!"

                "body": "Some stats: I'm 5'2 and in my 20s, so I'm very not into most of what's floating around on the internet regarding style guides for SNs :'( I'm also not super thin, so it's hard finding clothes that fit my stature and my chest/torso. I'm definitely a gaminish SN and am easily overwhelmed by too much fabric, so YMMV regarding these items.\n\nAs a disclaimer, I totally get that Kibbe says items don't have types.........but in my (admittedly more limited) experience I do not find that piece of wisdom to be very helpful. I think there are items that require too much styling work to fit into my wardrobe, and there are other items that seamlessly integrate. \n\nI will be focusing on the items that seamlessly integrate! And I will also share what didn't work.\n\n**WHAT WORKED FOR ME**  \n\n[Dana Long Sleeve Tee (LISA SAYS GAH)](https://lisasaysgah.com/products/dana-long-sleeve-tee-white-pretzels?variant=41990180995252#)\n\nI believe this shirt works because it's fitted through the torso and the fabric is a soft medium weight. There is a very slight rib texture that conforms to the body nicely. It has a slightly dropped shoulder on this model, but it fits me at the shoulders perfectly. The neckline is also very flattering. One of my new favorite tops!!!!\n\nFrom Kibbe:\n\n>Weights should be light to moderate so fluid movement is possible. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k6bclg5iuh5a1.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e21f97579b99ec6ab33a3dafd062859db1bdf379\n\n[Smocked Peplum Top (GAP)](https://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=451507002&pcid=999&vid=1&searchText=peplum#pdp-page-content)\n\nI think this top would work for any yin type. The square neckline, shirred bodice, and peplum flare are SUPER flattering. I've never owned anything peplum, so the fit of this was a nice surprise. The fabric is very soft and drapey\u2014a lot of fun to swish around in. I wear this most often with menswear-inspired trousers.\n\nRelevant Kibbe quote:\n\n>Sleeves can be full and flowing or gently tapered at the wrist with a minimum of detail. Trim should be delicate and antique (shirring, applique, etc.). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6mutnwkxvh5a1.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b263b58a935698a2f23b82c1b4c0b1e2c45bd3bd\n\n[Bodysuit (ARQ)](https://shoparq.com/collections/paloma-leo/products/paloma-leo-pistachio)\n\nMy first bodysuit! The raglan sleeves and pleated bust look great. The neckline is beautiful. It's also super easy to dress up or down. I got mine at a discount, and there are a ton for sale on resale sites!! \n\nFrom Kibbe:\n\n>Necklines should be loose and soft, not closed, restricted, or fussy (simple draped necklines; soft cowls, soft, notched collars; clean lapels, shawl collars, etc.)\u00a0  \n>  \n>Your use of color should be vibrant and rich. Brights and pastels form the basis of your wardrobe, but soft neutrals with a little vivid accenting can be very elegant and exciting in beautiful textures.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xvmrkack7i5a1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=697294425dc4f1e55ce5664316685e278685b129\n\n[Keyhole applique cardigan (thrifted Bob Mackie)](https://www.google.com/search?q=bob+mackie+cardigan&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjPhdm_w_T7AhUXFFkFHbsjDo4Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=bob+mackie+cardigan&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECCMQJ1CHBliHBmDCBmgAcAB4AIABOIgBaZIBATKYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=dFqXY8_7Bpeo5NoPu8e48Ag&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS924US924)\n\nI don't like most cardigans\u2014I find most of them to be either dowdy or constricting. But this one is perfect!!! The fabric is, once again, soft and medium-weight. The arms are quite drapey but tapered. The neckline showcases my collarbones. The hemline is rounded. And there is an amazing applique right in the center!! (Kibbe was right on the money with SNs and appliques.)\n\nThis piece reminds me a bit of what [Matilda Djerf](https://djerfavenue.com/en-us/dream-cardigan-cloud/) (suspected SN) is currently doing with her keyhole cardigans. I think the key here is the fabric\u2014it has to be soft and drapey!\n\nMy only styling issue is that I *have* to wear this with a square-neck top with short or no sleeves, which is a bit annoying. I've paired this with bustiers and tube tops, but I'm open to other ideas!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rutmotjaxh5a1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c843a76ec7c012bacf4aed7dbe6f334977d7ca31\n\n[Slouchy sweater (Yesstyle)](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/rorah-argyle-sweater/info.html/pid.1085234205)\n\nI purchased this years ago (before I stopped buying fast fashion) and it has surprisingly become one of my favorite sweaters! The fabric is thick but drapey, and the arms and hemline are rounded. It ends around my hips, which I find easy to style. I wear this with flared jeans or a white midi dress, and I style it with a white collar like in the photo.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgajfnc04i5a1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9ac62c4681b2914226180f961ab30e9ffcf63ded\n\n[Relaxed jeans (Djerf Avenue)](https://djerfavenue.com/en-us/relaxed-jeans-washed-blue/)\n\nMy first Djerf Ave purchase, and it is STUNNING. I've never owned pants like these so I had no idea what it was going to look like on me, but it fits perfectly. Once again, the fabric is very soft, and it's a medium-weight that drapes beautifully around the legs. I have a short torso, and I think this low-to-mid-rise suits me better than a high-rise. It's a little long on me without shoes, but I wear this with lug-sole derbies to give myself a bit of height.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jftvp9j52i5a1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=962810a70a8f416ea157fb16279705b5f5f936e8\n\n[Work pants (Big Bud Press)](https://bigbudpress.com/collections/work-pants/products/petite-work-pants-navy-blue?variant=41778035720385)\n\nI don't see BBP mentioned a lot on this sub, but they're seriously one of the best size-inclusive brands out there. I own a few pairs of pants in different colors from them, but my recent hero has been the work pant. The cut of these pants is super flattering, and the fabric is thick enough to work for the winter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mjp4mibc6i5a1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=74bc4fd597244c11bd1af9d74f81f349ab751e92\n\n[Tiered midi skirt (Adored Vintage)](https://www.adoredvintage.com/products/classic-vintage-inspired-black-white-gingham-tiered-midi-skirt?_pos=1&_sid=bc7ee8003&_ss=r)\n\nI find tiered skirts to be very flattering since they are flared but give the impression of flatness at the hip. I also find that skirts with pleating detail can look super cool. I wear these with fleece tights and knee-high boots to stay warm.\n\nFrom Kibbe:\n\n>Gathers and folds should be deep, full and soft.\u00a0  \n>  \n>Skirts should have a soft outline. Full or flared skirts that are flat in the hip area are excellent. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eys5ty3owh5a1.png?width=1212&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1c27595eb7f63a3a929fe31565551bd0d4acdaeb\n\n[Colorful](https://losangelesapparel.net/products/rn040-40-denier-opaque-tights?variant=37787859714227) or [patterned](https://www.ssense.com/en-us/women/product/lauren-perrin/green-tie-dye-tights/9808791) tights\n\nCrazy tights have kind of become my personality\u2014they speak for themselves!! They're a little harder to style in the dead of winter, but come spring and fall I am ALWAYS wearing tights in funky colors and patterns. I think they bring a lot of freshness to our outfits.\n\nFrom Kibbe:\n\n>Opaque stockings in light shades are soft, and you may definitely contrast the stocking with the hemline, if you wish. Bright and textured stockings are excellent for fun.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/crlfus8z2i5a1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c3924f086bc96e922d56ab26c761739b059a2592\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9x2ejydc3i5a1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3ed604b39e747f7e7fbb66a30c60d8cb83a9c461\n\n[White collars](https://www.amazon.com/Shinywear-Detachable-Collar-Office-Dickey/dp/B0BLYTR5Y5)\n\nI throw these under practically every sweater I own. Not only can they be a warm layering piece, but they add some needed structure to sweaters that can otherwise feel sloppy on an SN. I alternate between a detachable collar, a sleeveless vest, and a button-down shirt.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spakevgr0i5a1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4fd0c44e5583ce322f9e63023e2a61428ca186b6\n\n**WHAT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME**\n\n[Fangio Vest (LISA SAYS GAH)](https://lisasaysgah.com/products/lsg-s001?variant=41472334561460#)\n\nI love sweater vests and I REALLY wanted this to work (look at the print!!! the colors!!!), but I think the cap sleeve and length did not flatter me at all. I tried styling it with a skirt and button-up shirt, and my bf said I looked like I was in a costume lol. I think this would look AMAZING on the more yang types!! Also, any recommendations for sweater vests for SNs? Lol\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pf7sym4bvh5a1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c28063afa234dcfa49309242ed1483668c8c49af\n\n[Puff sleeve cropped sweater (LA Apparel)](https://losangelesapparel.net/products/fm06gd-fisherman-cropped-tee?variant=37788080013491)\n\nShort puff sleeves look AWFUL on me. Is this typical of most SNs? The quality of this piece is nice, but the texture is too heavy. I think heavy, ribbed knits can easily be overwhelming on us.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6uqda3ud8i5a1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2cd7fb527114b2f4335ebb596c3a4b4ee1bb5945\n\nCoat (Burberry) [(similar)](https://us.burberry.com/the-camden-heritage-car-coat-p80580361?istCompanyId=564e1513-f47e-4b67-be63-f610234165ed&istFeedId=8cf3583f-d329-465d-b0c6-94f120d80dba&istItemId=rxpmqillm&istBid=t&pla=true&gclid=CjwKCAiAv9ucBhBXEiwA6N8nYK403YxByABV02E1u_FbR1tNkt2_du4TwlLn7ppkIwT0erIMaWtZPxoCPC4QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)\n\nI bought this used from The Real Real. I wanted to get a coat with raglan sleeves because I often find shoulders to be too tight on me, but this one was WAY too plain. And the lack of curve in the chest area was extremely unflattering lol.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/70iw5r959i5a1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=643d66a96b4fcb73df0ebd8656101deb67237433\n\n[Puff sleeve shirt (Adored Vintage)](https://www.adoredvintage.com/collections/tops/products/timeless-vintage-inspired-light-blue-plaid-crochet-detail-babydoll-top)\n\nAnother puff sleeve disaster. Honestly, I don't know what I was thinking with this one. It would really suit a gamine, though!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qr33qeh0ai5a1.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0795107d645d4b7fc184df460bcd73b884df92d7\n\nRed slit skirt (Fashion Brand Company)\n\nI love FBC and I own so many clothes from there, but this skirt just looked awful on me. This was very disappointing because it looks AMAZING on the models, but it was indeed not \"full\" and \"flowing\" as our lord Kibbe suggests for SNs. (Picture is the same skirt in faux leather fabric.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kkj5wymsbi5a1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70f29998468a1e1eeda10c72125316de90074811\n\n\\--\n\nSo, what do the winners have in common? Most of them have round hemlines, and all of them have mid-weight, soft, drapey fabric. (The trick to staying warm in thinner fabrics is to layer!) And what do all the losers have in common? They are not flowy and drapey. The fabrics are either too stiff and heavy or too light and airy. And (controversial) I think built-in dropped sleeves do not flatter SNs. I find that if the sleeve is dropped, it has to be VERY dropped, and the fabric should be thinner. \n\nAnyway, please learn from my mistakes! And if anyone has thoughts on what coats look best on SNs, I would love to hear\u2014I am REALLY struggling in that area lol."

Quadriboob is common. Bras with too much structure seem to be worse. \n\nWhen measured IRL at  Adore Me, I was told I was a 34G \u2014 the 34G balconette bra fit fine but the wire dug in really badly. Most of my bras are victoria\u2019s secret 34DD\n\nTLDR: Is an unlined bra the move?? I can\u2019t figure out my shape or what I need. I\u2019m fairly confident I have tall, wide roots, though."

They feel below Victoria's Secret and one step above Shein. The straps are thin and flimsy and the lace is lumpy. It feels like a $12 bra, not a supposedly $55+ one. \n3. One of the bras has the lace sewn inside in such an odd way I can't tell if it's a manufacturer error or intentional. It looks wrong and the design choice makes boobs look lumpy.\n4. The two bras that are the same size and style (balcony) fit horribly in different ways. The fabric has so little stretch and such a weird shape that my boobs like like weird eggs? And one of them the cut of the bra is such that the top of the bra on one side has weird spillage??\n5. To return any of the items from the US, you must pay to ship. Mine would d cost   $186 to ship. Not even worth it! Wish I had realized!! \n6. It's also nearly impossible to leave reviews on the website. Actually, it might be impossible? I spent a few minutes trying to figure it out and couldn't do it, so now I do not trust any of the ones on the site. \n\n\nTLDR: Surprisingly poor quality, can't return from US unless you want to spend a ton of money. It would have cost me $186 to return $70 of bras. Disgrace."

Or when a Garrosh throws you in, and adds insult to injury by reducing your heals. Let's not forget cain's 75% heal reduction and Xul's at 20. Even Malthael has one as 7 (-50%). Twin blades mortal strike is a permanent heal reduction on one hero (if not blinded) which is so fun to play against! \n\nNot only does heal reduction make your healer virtually useless, but it makes the game unbearable and have 0 counter play against stun lock comps where the medallion and healing would be the only way to counter it. \n\nLast point, not sure if this is even relevant to my rant, but when your spell power is reduced, your healing is reduced as well. I don't think this is a fair mechanic (but some will argue that when spell power is increased, the opposite happens as well). However this is just a cheap way to not even have to focus a healer or dps when you can reduce all incoming and SELF sustain.\nEdit: made worse by the fact that many of these reduced heals can have AOE effects and are point and clicks.\n\nRant over."

The UK is transferring non-op trans women into men\u2019s prisons. The US is openly attempting to encourage suicide in trans youth through removal of access to support and medical care.\n\nNobody is going to die on this hill with us because we\u2019re so tiny of a minority.\n\nWe need to organize and establish underground supply lines to help each other with HRT, shelter, food, education and escape from hostile environments because we can\u2019t count on anyone else to do it.\n\nI know I\u2019m screaming into the void right now, still stuck in retail, but I\u2019m going to get qualified in IT and work my way up until I have a position I can support less privileged trans people from and I encourage everyone who has the capability to do the same to also follow a similar path. Capitalism is the true enemy, of course, but Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. If we act to support each other as much as possible and put ourselves in positions of privilege through our community support, we can do some powerful good in the world, both for ourselves and for others less able to advocate for themselves. \n\nWe CAN make a difference if we all stick together, protest together, work together by creating safe and affirming workplaces for each other, work to help each other find housing and never giving up. (These are just examples, whichever way you can help or build towards to help is worthwhile)\n\nAnd saving ourselves would just be the beginning of what we could do.\n\nTransgender people are by and large the most left - wing demographic in the western world. We may be small as a minority,  but as a united political front we could punch far above our weight.\n\nWe don\u2019t need a leader, we just need to actively create projects to support each other and generally go out of our way to help.\n\nPlease share both your ideas in the comments and this post with anyone you deem fit."

I don't really know what's going on... plz help\n\nEDIT: I have a work around for this issue but I don't really know why it won't work regularly... if I press the capture midi button after I play the take, it capture's the sustain information. I'm still curious why once I hit the record button, sustain just doesn't work..\n\nedit again....: the work around doesn't actually work... it worked in the past. but it doesn't work right now. the really odd thing is that my keyboard has a triple pedal setup, and the sustenuto pedal works just fine when recording, however the sustain pedal really doesn't want to work. Also it happens when I press play not just recording. This issue has become increasingly frustrating because I have no way to add sustain to this track. It's spitfire's cinematic soft piano btw. "

A Comic Book Cookbook\" and I've been using store bought dried noodles. \nBut today I made my own noodles without a pasta machine. I gotta say it's a lot of hard work making a thin sheet of dough. My hands hurt and it took all day to make 5 servings of noodles. However, I think there's something quite special about them, compared to the noodles I've been using. The taste, texture.. the fact that you actually have to eat them quickly or else they get soggy. It's pretty magical. \n\nAlthough I got pretty good at rolling the dough, I need to get my hands on a pasta machine because my hands can't take it anymore. \n\nTl;Dr Today I learned that you can in fact make ramen noodles by hand, but it made my hands very sore. Just buy a pasta roller."

The cup was slightly sour but I didnt think much of the channeling at the moment.\n\nThe second cup I went a little finer for some reason I didnt really think of what I saw in the last brew. And I tried to add the second pour quicker so I could move the slurry around (in this case with the rao spin) which actually made it better but I had overshot the weight. (Which is something I'm still trying work on) anyways it was bitter and I wanted to make a better cup. (I didnt drink it all)\n\nOn the third try which is one of my best cups using this recipe. I went back to my original grind setting and my first pour was over shot by 10g (70g) but I tried to do everything else the same way. And out came a pretty good cup. Despite the acidity being high, It wasnt sour.\n\nSo although I might have already found the answer, I wanted to know if anyone has any tips on that second pour. If I dont do anything to it, there will always be channeling. Is it the way I'm pouring? Is it my technique? \n\nP.S. I had just thought to add one more thing. \nI pour pretty close to the brewer should I raise the kettle a little to create more turbulence? I've had enough coffee today but I will probably try it tomorrow morning. But I wonder if that is something I could do..\nBut if I add water slowly would the slurry not move as much? More testing need on my part..\n"

Every day I am adding more and more of verified celebrities and no one but the R and TR lines (Kibbe and his wife too) do this. Some S types get really close but not quite. There is still separation. I need to find where he supposedly debunked it. My current theory is, I know he wants this all to remain pretty abstract and subjective, so even if it were fact that this works, he wouldn\u2019t want it to be used as it adds a level of objectivity to it that he doesn\u2019t want. Although, what I am enjoying seeing, is regardless of conventional curve or not, the R lines are proving over and over that this happens. I have not found an R or TR verified person who doesn\u2019t have this occur, and I haven\u2019t found (outside of Ice Spice) any other ID with it out of the verified celebs. So thus far, I believe it is worth it. Currently, I\u2019m just working on building up my folders. It takes time, to use the verified list, find a good picture of them, and then apply it and save to the designated folder. I\u2019m also debating if I need to do hollow circles to better see it? Or if I need to also add the no circles picture as well?\n\nI did have someone mention that I shouldn\u2019t use circles on everyone due to us being different shapes, and I\u2019ve used other shapes. The thing is, even Kibbe says, all women have some curve. Curve is a circle or oval or such. The way I\u2019m doing this, which is just taking in the perimeters of the hip region and the perimeters of the bust region (stopped by edge of bust, rib cage, or top of shoulders), then using circles is the most accurate way to do this. \n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s for my own fun since discovering this (though there are articles that point it out, I don\u2019t think anyone has been putting together something this extensive) though, until something otherwise shows this to be faulty, I will believe this shows something in this. The consistency is what is doing it for me.",

                "body": "Thank God I've finally found a sub where I can voice my anxieties about possibly being pregnant without it violating the rules and regulations! I'm just looking to get this off my chest because it's driving me insane. I usually have pretty regular cycles, between 28 and 30 days. I'm not tracking them precisely as my boyfriend and I are not TTC (much to my chagrin, but that's another story). I missed my period in September, most likely due to stress. It usually comes mid-month. A couple of weeks ago, we had unprotected sex and we both figured I'd be fine because I'd missed my period. Reading that now as I type it makes me feel like a huge dumbass. I should have known that ovulation could happen at any time because my cycle was obviously out of whack. \n\nA couple of days later I got pretty thick EWCM. As noted above, I'm not doing any of the fancy tracking like using OPKs or BBT readings to pinpoint ovulation, but I think it's safe to assume I ovulated sometime in those two days or the two days after. So there's at least some chance fertilization could have happened. Last weekend I started having some mild cramping, which made me think my period was about to come, though that would make no sense if I'd only ovulated a few days earlier. These were very dull cramps that have come and gone in bursts since then (Sunday, Sept. 29th was when they started). Of course I've been consulting Dr. Google non-stop. I've read numerous articles saying that dull cramps - along with a general tenderness of the lower abdomen, in my case - can be a sign of implantation. But then, I'm wondering if it's too early for implantation to have happened. If I *am* pregnant, I know the exact date when we had sex (Sept. 22nd), but not the exact date of ovulation. Implantation usually occurs 6-12 days after fertilization. I estimate that I ovulated between Sept. 24th and 26th, which would mean that, at the earliest, implantation might have happened last weekend. \n\nBesides the dull cramps, I've experienced a couple of other things that have me wondering. I feel like my sense of smell has been heightened in the past week but that might just be in my head. It's hard to know for sure. Something else that happened just yesterday, but is supposed to only happen to women in their third trimester, is that lightning crotch sensation. All of a sudden I felt this quick, sharp zap right in my lady parts. It happened a couple more times within a few seconds and then subsided. I went to Google it and, lo and behold, it can be a sign of pregnancy. I've come across some anecdotal evidence of other women experiencing it very early in pregnancy so apparently it's not impossible.\n\nI'm trying so hard not to be impatient, but I want to wait at least another week and a half before I take a pregnancy test. I know the changes of getting a false negative are way higher the earlier you test, so I'm just going to stick it out. Of course the ideal would be to wait to see if my period comes, but I'm not sure I'll be able to hold out that long. I just want to know one way or the other. I've been minding everything I put into my body this week, just in case. I've felt super anxious a couple of times drinking a latte that I forgot to order decaf. I know I'm totally overreacting, but since I don't know yet I'd rather not take any chances. All I can say is the infamous TWW (two week wait) is brutal. If you've read up to this point, I thank you and I appreciate you. Please feel free to reply...maybe you've had a similar experience and got a BFP (or BFN, as the case may be)...or maybe I'm just bonkers lol. Tell me if I'm being nuts or if it sounds like there's a chance I could be pregnant.\n\nCheers!"

I will try and help however needed, but I\u2019m not trying to force any changes or be controlling. The capacity to which you take the advice is up to you, and I (of course) believe that the writer knows best. I will be attempting to operate as a professional would, and I will gladly take feedback on how to be more constructive and helpful.\n\n**If you are interested:**\n\nDrop your logline and material and please specify what type of help you\u2019re looking for here or via Pm. Would you like to workshop from the ground up? Do you need help with a scene or a theme? Would you like free coverage done? I\u2019m open to pretty much any type of help, just specify so I know. Depending on how many I receive, I will work with the ones most grabbing to me, whether they need the most help or the least.\n\n**About me**\n\nOf course, my feedback is subjective and untested, but as lots of script readers are fresh out of college, I will be giving a perspective similar to ones you may find after sending your script off to \u201cthe industry\u201d. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in my work, I have a script posted, and I will link an example of the cursory feedback I have given on here previously. Once I get on my computer, I will also try and link coverage I have completed for college. \n\nI\u2019m excited to help! Let me know if I can :)\n\nLink to last (quick) feedback given: https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadMyScript/comments/nj3qnp/my_first_scene_is_really_good_the_rest_is_hot/gz60pt0/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;amp;amp;context=3"

                "body": "So I'm watching TellTales Fires Side Chat channel (I can link the video in comments if yall want it) and on it he is commenting on this tiktokers end times prophecies. Apparently people around the world have been hearing strange noises  that are actually the trumpets of the seven angels \\*eye roll\\*. I recently deconverted/deconstructed from Christianity and took a break looking at anything from the crazies and related to religion. Coming back now, I realize just how much of a cult I was in. Sure, there are some Christians out there who aren't batshit crazy and I really appreciate those people. But the religion itself is a damned cult. The end times stuff is a fine example of this. Using fear to bring people into the fold/ keep them from leaving. \n\nChristians twist what is and isn't a choice to keep people in the religion. I recently drove through Kansas and saw a sign saying \"Its not a choice, its a baby\". A baby is a choice actually. The act of sex must be done in order for a baby to be created. It doesn't grow suddenly like a tumor. My partner and I can decide we want to have a baby and then try for one. But when that act is forced, that person never made the choice to have a baby or that interaction. No matter how you swing it, a baby *is* a choice. Meanwhile, it's not a choice on who you love, same sex or not, but they claim that IS a choice. And why does Christianity give such a shit on why you have that baby or not? So they can get more fodder for the machine and continue to have life long money givers. Without people attending, the church dies out. Also, to feed the sick child perverts within the church that we've seen so many cases of. And these people know whats happening (looking at you Catholic Church AND Southern Baptist!) and cover it up or deny it when it comes to light. I strongly believe now that they want babies specifically to give to these perverts. \n\nThey tell you how to live your life and what to think. \"Be a godly woman and have children, stay at home.\" \"Be a godly man and shove religion down everyone's throats\". \"Ensure your children are taught the fear of God so they never stray\". Your entire soul is at stake here. You don't want to be part of the world. You don't want to enjoy anything the world has to offer- it's the devils temptations. Don't listen to the voice that makes you doubt God, or He will cast you into the fire! And all my life, though it apparently wasn't always this way- vote for this candidate because that's who God ordained. \n\nI don't know what Christianity was like before damn Constantine made it an official thing and wiped out all the other sects that sprouted. I don't know what it was like when it was Jesus actually talking. But what it is today is nothing more than a cult designed to get money, keep people in power, and control others. I'm certain if Jesus came back, he would recognize Atheists as being more what he envisioned than Christians. \n\nAnd every time I see something related to Christianity, it kinda slaps me in the face that I was actually in a cult. I lived my life as if I was a Mormon- I didn't even drink coffee because I didn't want to become addicted to anything! But I wasn't in that group at all. Wasn't in anything that was actually labeled a cult. I was simply in non-denominational churches that were \"spirit filled\"- aka Pentecostal. There must be something else going on if I wasn't actually \"in the cult\" and yet I lived my life as if I was, right?\n\nSimple. Christianity itself is a cult. I'm glad to see people waking up to it, leaving the church and faith, heck even saying \"this isn't what Jesus wanted\" and just being better people. The cult has lived for way too long. It's time for it to die."

I declined and she jumped right into the idea that I just \"didn't believe in God\". I'm never going out on Sunday again. And I'm fucking pissed this happened because I'm not even in the fucking Bible Belt anymore!)\n\nIt's not about not believing in your God. It's about recognizing how completely terrible your god is. Your god purposely hardened the pharaohs heart to show off how powerful he was. Your god only  stopped after he could murder the first born CHILDREN. He told the Isrealites to go and completely wipe out nations. He sent a flood to kill literally everyone on Earth because they didn't worship him. He murdered Aarons two sons simply for using the wrong type of incense. \n\nAnd then he sent a man down, who is him and yet not, to be a sacrifice to himself, in order to feel a tiny amount of remorse for people and suddenly become all loving and all forgiving- while saying this is the only way you can earn my forgiveness. \n\nYour god is NOT a god of love. Your god is a narcissistic abuser who is not worthy of my adoration or worship. \n\nAnd that is leaving out all the clear cut evidence based in science and history that its all made the fuck up. Undoubtedly to control people. \n\nThere are a lot of deep reasons why I will never attend your church ma'am. Including the fact that I looked up your church before and all your pastors got their education in the Bible Belt. I'm from there and I know exactly what they are teaching because of that. \n\nYou can tell me all day that your church is different.  That its a church of love. I know that's a lie. It's not the first time I've heard that line and it always results in the same thing- you spew hate. Your church isn't even on any list of gay affirming churches. Some \"loving church\" you are. \n\nSo fuck off and fuck you for cornering me in the fucking grocery store, forcing me into an uncomfortable situation, clearly seeing I'm like a trapped animal who just wants to escape while still carrying on talking about how much abortion matters to you and how you now have so much responsibility to make things better for women now. While saying that you believe abortion is a mercy on those children because you believe all those who are born will go straight to hell. And then telling me \"God loves you\" while triggering some fucking PTSD shit I have from all my previous experiences.\n\nFuck you and your idea of love. You are EXACTLY the reason I left the fucked up controlling machine called Christianity."

TL;DR; my bf's family dropped off his old cat at our place and after two months we are returning her because fuck cats and their bullshit!\n\nIt has recently been solidified that I fucking hate cats. My bf's family moved and passed by where we live and left their cat off with us. They were trying to be nice (my bf adopted her ages ago but then had to move because of work and couldn't take her with him) but holy fuck two months and we have called and we are taking her back to his family in a month. She is the loudest licker I have EVER heard. Even my cat-loving friend was shocked at how loud she was! The cat has finally made it register that I have Misophonia- I have a severe fight response when I hear loud sounds related to eating. She makes the most AWFUL squishy licking noises that INSTANTLY severely triggers me. Best part? I leave the room so I don't have to deal with it AND SHE FOLLOWS ME INTO THE NEW ROOM, SITS DOWN, AND CONTINUES. She is CONSTANTLY grooming herself like this. I can't think of anytime she isn't grooming other than when she is sleeping or chilling for like two minutes at a time.\n\nThen she fucking yowls. She literally woke me up last night yowling all because she wanted in the fucking room I was sleeping in, at fucking 11pm. Before I started closing the door, she started playing fucking cat alarm at 2:59 in the morning. At the time I was waking up at 3am for work. One minute before my actual alarm goes off. Give me the damn minute you POS cat! Her loud ass licking has woken me up multiple times too! And one night, I was LITERALLY about to fall asleep and SHE FUCKING YOWLED IN MY FACE. I'M NOT KIDDING LITERALLY I OPENED MY EYES AND I SAW THIS CAT. \n\nAnd shes a fucking bully for food! She will literally rub against your legs and cutely meow up at you to get food. But if you ignore her and don't give her food, and walk away, she fucking stalks you AND BITES YOUR FOOT. She has bitten me so many fucking times! As a solution to everything, we got an automatic feeder and she STILL is a bully because we give her wet food at 3pm. 2pm today, she was stalking and biting our feet because we would NOT give her the wet food early! Listen cat you work on MY schedule NOT I work on yours!\n\nAnd then just the fucking kitchen. This cat will be in a literal DEAD SLEEP and as soon as I walk into the kitchen, SHE IS RIGHT THERE AT MY FEET. We've gotten in the habit of basically hissing at her to try and get her out, but I have literally tripped over her AND SHE BIT ME FOR IT. FUCK YOU CAT! \n\nNow I'm the type of person to say okay, every animal deserves a chance. I will google solutions to problems so we can all live happily together. But fucking cat owners on the internet are always like \"welcome to being a cat slave, just give in!\" or \"how fucking dare you have a problem with anything your cat does, you horrible piece of shit?!\" Like fucking wanting to not be love bit all the damn time is a fucking problem? Not wanting the cat to be literally in between my legs when I'm cooking and moving around in the kitchen is a problem? These people literally make me think I'm a horrible person just because I don't like a certain animal being in my home. And I bet these same people have issues with dogs, which I LOVE. So basically, reading those comments make me feel like cat owners are bullying me and making me feel like something is wrong with me, when literally they are just as big of POS's as their cat masters are.\n\nAnd then their other BS is \"don't spray a cat because it'll teach them nothing and they'll just get aggressive towards you!\" I cant fucking train a cat! I can't freaking teach this cat to not do behavior that will annoy me, and thus make me more prone to giving her love. Cats are literally the most training adverse animals I have EVER dealt with. I have a dog and he quickly learned \"Hey mom told me 'out' that means leave the kitchen, let me go sit down and watch her, ill go in later and grab bits off the ground!\" But the cat? No, she looks at me like \"wtf human!\" and then her dumb cat brain doesn't seem to connect when you do a certain action THAT'S when you get the spray/hiss so maybe fucking stop doing the behavior? No apparently cats just think you fucking hate them and don't learn WHICH MAKES ME ACTUALLY HATE THEM.\n\nAnytime I live with a cat (because this isn't the first one), I literally feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with them. I walk on eggshells because I'm terrified that if i don't do what they want, I'll fucking pay hell somehow. If I do cave in, then I'm the one who has no damn boundaries for myself and just become the slave of the animal. I'm terrified of picking her up when she is licking and moving her to another room because I don't want her to claw at me. She hasn't yet, but I've pet her and shes nipped my hand and she regularly goes for nipping my ankle, foot, leg, whatever. \n\nAnd to anyone who says \"she has energy play with her!\" THIS CAT DOES NOT PLAY. She will watch something move and say \"oh that's cool!\" and WALK OFF. she wont jump, wont bat, wont do anything so how the fuck am I supposed to get any \"pent up energy\" out of her?\n\nThe cat I lived with previously. That cat was my roommates cat and was a fucking nightmare too. That cat would NOT let me sleep. Naturally, at that point I would have my door closed and that cat would yowl CONSTANTLY. I had to sleep with my door cracked so this fucker could come in at night. At one point, I got this automatic spray that would make a hiss noise to scare it off. the fucker stopped sitting directly in front of my door and would get just outside of its range AND SING THE SONG OF HIS PEOPLE UNTIL I OPENED THE FUCKING DOOR. And then that cat would ALWAYS be on the fucking counters and table. Get the fuck off where I eat you piece of shit, I don't want your fur and poopy butthole where my food is!\n\nI hate liter boxes. I don't care what litter you have, they always smell. I hate feeling like this isn't my home anymore. Thank fuck that I only have one more month to put up with this and then we are taking her back to my bf's family, who actually miss her, which is good because they can keep her! The only good thing I can say about her is she isn't tearing up our home or furniture, which that last cat I lived with did. \n\nThank you for reading and letting me scream that off my shoulders. Thank fuck she is going to be leaving and if his family doesn't end up taking her back, we will find a shelter program that will place her directly into a home. Because as angry as cats make me, I don't want any of them to be euthanized or on the streets. I want all animals to have loving homes. I just don't want cats in *my* home anymore."

                "body": "I recently found a book called \"Sovereign Self\" by Acharya Shunya. In a nutshell, its a book about Vedic wisdom and how it can be applied to our lives. This book has me seriously thinking on a level I've never thought on before. It's making me look inward while uplifting my self-esteem and self-worth. It's also been making me reflect more on Christianity and helping calm that bit inside of me that still goes \"but what if...? \n\nFor example. The book mentions pop spirituality and how many tote meditation as the \"fast fix to solving all your spiritual problems\". \"Just 30 minutes a week out of your life, and you'll be a new person!\" The author asks \"Why would we settle for such a quick solution to the most sacred of our journeys?\" And that made me think. I remember reading an article on why someone was a Christian. They said it was because all religions have you slave away trying to reach God, but in Christianity, God came to us! Therefore, it's true \\[because it's different from all the others\\]. But with the question posed, Christianity is the pure definition of \"pop spirituality\". It's like a \"lose weight fast!\" promise. \"Accept Jesus and that's it! New you and all your problems will be fixed!\" \n\nWhen I look around the world, I can't find a single instance in which it actually works that way. If I want to be a doctor, I have to put the work into going to school. If I want to start a business, I need to put the work in to getting loans, office space, and employees (and much more!). Even in my personal relationships, I have to put forth effort to keep them strong. Nothing in this world provides me gratification without hard work or at least some type of effort. So why would I expect the god, who supposedly created the world this way, to be the opposite?\n\nWhen I look up \"Christianity is too good to be true\" so much apologetics comes up explaining why its certainly true and yes, that good! And now it's making me realize how much Christianity is *sold* to people. It's sold like a product on a shelf, a quick and easy, no hassle answer to all of your problems. It's not a path to spiritual enlightenment, peace, or wisdom... its a pill to swallow to give you a short placebo effect.\n\nAnything worthwhile takes hard effort. We don't hit roadblocks and throw up our hands. We keep trying and don't stop achieving our goals. And how proud we are because of all that effort we put into it. So after reflection yes... Christianity is indeed, too good to be true."

It's such an obvious ignoring of history and archeology, I can't believe this guy is actually a professor. And people in the comments are praising this guy for revealing something that's so true and \"people just don't want to use the name Jesus because it makes nonbelievers believers\". Look commenter, I literally wished that upon myself and nothing happened. In fact, I use Jesus' name all the time when people are being ridiculous. With the amount of swearing I do, I should have complete faith. \n\nThe amount of brainwashing here is at max level. It's the blind leading the blind. I just wanted the historical information from when the Hebrews were polytheists and when God had a wife, not some Christian bullshit about why they're right and everyone else is wrong. -.- I guess it's my fault, I didn't read the username that said \"REAL Bible Believers\" but damn the video looked legit at first glance.\n\nVideo link for anyone interested.

                "body": "I can't even properly convey how I feel about this man anymore. Anger at his lie. Disgust that such a vile man existed. To put into context, and maybe this well help people out, Paul legit lied about the entire religion. He used Jesus as a front man to his personal agenda. I found a post on here years ago talking about how Paul clearly contradicts Jesus ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/hj9v9q/modern_christians_are_followers_of_paul_not_jesus/) and [here](http://www.voiceofjesus.org/paulvsjesus.html)). And then I did more research. I found that there is a text from the Ebonites that is talked about by Epiphanius, an early church bishop ([here](https://jdstone.org/cr/files/paul_sex.html)). He said these people claimed Paul wasn't even Jewish, he was pagan and converted to win over a Jewish woman. That failed and thus he became spiteful towards the Jewish people and wrote against them and their customs. Epiphanius writes as if its a heresy but conveniently, the early church completely wiped out anything that spoke contradictory to or against them. So I wondered- what if these \"heresies\" are actually the truth and what we got was the lie? What is the other side of the story, the one of James and Peter and the early Jewish Christians whom we don't get to hear?\n\nThis shit stinks so bad and it repulses and angers me. Fuck Paul! How many people died because this man was angry he got circumcised? How many people's lives were ruined by the church because of this mans hate? And fuck Constantine too. If it wasn't for him making this an official religion, it might have just ended up in the history books. The church wouldn't have been formed and they wouldn't have been able to claim (another lie btw) of apostilistic succession from Peter.\n\nI wondered if Christianity was the problem or the people were. Now I know it was created on the foundation of lies and control. And how clearly can we see this underlying vein of control and hatred? A priest told me that a gay couple can't adopt as a couple (they can do it separately though!) but a straight infertile couple can- although, as a friend informed me, the church often looks down on that couple anyway because all the church cares about is if you can make babies. And that's all its about. Controlling the narrative, the people, and ensuring the creation of new fodder for the indoctrination and control machine. Because innocent, clean slate babies are easier to keep in the faith than grown knowledgeable adults are.\n\nI'm sickened. I'm disgusted. I'm glad that I'm finally awake to the true horrors of this fucked up religion and institution. I don't want to hate it- I have seen peoples lives turn around because of it and I know good people who are Christian. But that can be said of any religion, I've also seen people turn into right arseholes because of religion, and I think that individual people have all the influence on how their religion shapes them anyway."

The amount of accusations from Christians on me \"misinterpreting the Bible\"or being too \"heathen to understand such a holy text\" is astounding! There are plenty of other people on there commenting and telling these people off (and for the sake of my own anger levels I haven't paid too much attention to the comments overall) but the sheer arrogance and assumptions of these people astound me. One person said \"I bet you a million dollars you didn't genuinely pray over the Bible\". I said \"Welp, you owe me a million dollars! Don't assume you know my story. You don't\". And that I think is what angers me the most about these people. Not that you think I'm a demonic piece of shit, but that you sit there and are the biggest hypocrite ever saying you follow a guy that preached \"love thy neighbor\" and yet you blatantly come attack me... *on an Atheist video mind you.* Like wtf do you expect going to an Atheist site and attacking people? You think you'll get through to people and help them \"see the light\" by being a total ass to them? That by assuming our story is all the same, you can say the magic cut, copy, and paste words and that'll make us \"go back to God\"? Reality check, promise you a lot of us left and take you for a giant joke because of those exact reasons.\n\nSorry boo boo, I don't know how I can \"misinterpret\" Paul telling slaves to be good slaves and women to shut up during services (which is a confirmed forgery btw so talk to me about *that* misinterpretation please!), how God killed all of humanity, and how God can't get his shit straight on whether to use Moses' or Aaron's staff. I don't need to fucking pray to understand that God hates us and that you use that to control us, thank-you-very-fuck-you-much.

I wrote a statement that screamed to me as very Christian influenced and that is the \"we have a choice to believe or not\" argument. I know that belief isn't actually a choice, such as how I can go to a restaurant and chose what meal to have.\n\nSo that got me wondering. For you all who have already gone through this process, what was the process of gaining your belief? I guess it's an odd question, but did it occur over time or did something happen to change it to what it is now? I know for most Atheists it's generally the lack of evidence that led to your belief, but did you need time for that evidence to sink in or was it instant?\n\nI'm not exactly looking for stories on how you become an exChristian, I'm more curious about the belief forming process and if you had to first tackle and \"discard\" old beliefs before your new ones came or if it just evolved over time. I wonder sometimes if maybe I'm personally trying to push myself too hard to figure out **right**. **now**. what I believe and should calm down a little haha. Anything helps and thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone! Very eye-opening and helpful! I'm going to try and slow down and focus more on learning for the fun of it vs learning with a purpose and just focus more on unlearning certain perspectives that were instilled into me.

They just don't seem to want to admit that Christianity, even if it did at one point, doesn't represent love; all it represents now is hatred. The people who \"just leave to sin\" are literally leaving BECAUSE all they see is sin within the Church. Hypocrisy, child abuse, regular abuse, mental abuse, illogical arguments used to control people... I sit here and think in reality, the \"true Christians\" are leaving the religion because they know it's all corrupted tainted crap now. But then I ask \"but was it actually always just crap and people are just now gaining the courage to break free from it?\" I don't know guys, but I'm just sick of hearing so much victim blaming coming from these people. It makes me want to start posting my own videos and trying to reach out to the community to spread awareness and maybe have people turn a new leaf.

Since the end of the Button, we have continued our mission to proselytize the Church, support other battalions in their objectives, keep records and histories, and work with the Inquisition to keep the Order safe.\n\n\n#[Knights of the Ashen Blade](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAshenBlade/)\n\nCommander: [u/FeldsparThief](https://www.reddit.com/u/FeldsparThief/)\n\nAshen Blade? More like *Fashion Blade.* Once a member of less-than-completely friendly faction? Couldn\u2019t help but contribute a few black blotches to /r/place? Looking for something a little different to the typical rank and hierarchy... Or plainly, simply, can\u2019t see what else here fits? That\u2019s all okay, we do forgive and we sometimes forget. The Ashen ranks comprise former Swarm, Shade, Destructionists, Void \u2014 whichever worryingly titled online reddit.com nerd-faction you\u2019d care to mention. There are those among us with murky pasts, and while we\u2019re all totally past that now (it was totally just a phase, totally, totally) \u2014 a little murk never ruined any battalion, surely? Murky or murkfree, we welcome your hails and will never turn away an eager Knight with a desire to see a different side of the Order.\n\n\n#[Redguard](https://www.reddit.com/r/AprilKnights/comments/fdno4d/what_are_the_redguard/)\n\nCommander: [u/gryph667](https://www.reddit.com/u/gryph667/)\n\nThe Redguard accepts only veteran Knights, with a year or more of faithful service. We are the Last Line. As our discipline strove for the Cherry Fruits during the Button, so do we work to prove our mettle and worth. When time is short, in the shadow of doubt and fear, Forward the Redguard.\n\n\n*Please click on the Battalion title links to learn more about them.

I was trying to think of a couple NPCs that would be a good candidate to also believe werewolves didn't exist to help validate his incorrect belief. \n\nI was thinking about the hunters in Vallaki being good candidates. Reason being: they hunt wolves for a living, and even with enough indirect evidence to believe in werewolves, they probably would have motivated reasoning to want to not feel morally ambiguous about their job. Or at least not want other people to feel that they could be murderers. I don't think they directly know any werewolves, but it's hard to know for sure because the book is organized terribly.\n\nWhat do you think? Are there any other people that would be likely to say \"yeah werewolves don't exist, that's a bunch of rumors from Krezk\""

I dont know if people have adressed this already but it's personally bugging me out. I want something like in Rocket League, where you can literally have a \"season 1 champion tournament winner\" title that is oddly specific but still SOMETHING to award for my grind. I know that I shouldn't grind for any kind of reward, but just experiencing the symbol changing to something cooler and then it all being gone just isn't enough for me.\n\nIs this petty/silly, or am I making an understandable point here? I think it makes kind of sense that the player titles are seasonal, but just in general: There is no reward for playing a lot and grinding and that makes me feel like my achievements are worthless. (They are in my head, I am happy about them, but next season my rank decays so I forget about that anyways)."

Since the call was anonymous, I have no way to call them back.\n\nThe woman spoke fluent English so I\u2019m inclined to believe the call was legit, but I have no idea why they\u2019d be calling me - I play online pretty infrequently and haven\u2019t made any recent withdrawals or deposits. Anyone have any idea why they\u2019d be calling, or if this is just some kind of scam?"

I do not know how many students have joined in on this but a local news article listed the student's name (that's how I know they are in my class). \n\nI'm scared. I have no idea if I need to be worried about being tagged in this lawsuit because my class is synchronous online and she submitted this lawsuit while taking my class. However, I went to great lengths increasing my presence on campus with open door F2F tutoring times- of which this student has yet to participate in. \n\nShould I be looking into getting my own private insurance just in case she comes after me as well as the university? I'm also afraid the university will ask me to be a witness to defend the great lengths I went to in meeting the personal needs of students while teaching on zoom. I know it's a case to case basis, but I would like to know what my options are before just in case my fears come true.

My background is nursing and so I am a bit apprehensive of using these apps as they largely monitor pulse (HR), respiratory rate (RR), temperature, self reported \"how are you feeling?\" and some even use video recording of the HR, RR and temperature readings. For students running across campus, a rise in HR and RR is normal, however these apps would flag it as them possibly being sick. Not only that but individuals who have respiratory co-morbidities would also have a high HR and RR due to effects of inhalers or from the disease itself. -- Just some of my thoughts on the validity of these app readings. The app we recently looked at is from Presage.  \n\n\nHave any of you looked into apps like this? If so, what ones are your universities thinking of using? Are there any that you think would be worth the time, money and energy?"

NEVER AGAIN.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR : got really drunk at a party. keys fell off my pocket into narnia. was locked out of my airbnb at 3am and had to piss in a park."

WHAT THE FUCK.\nthen a few friends came to talk with me and i told them about it....they proceeded to tell me a mutual friend had ALSO been raped by this person. \nnot only that, but they also informed me that they put drugs in wine and then drugged their victim to rape them so they wouldn't resist. JUST LIKE IT WAS IN MY DREAM.\nagain, WHAT THE FUCK.\ni still have no clue on what to make off this whole situation. i was not directly raped by this person but it almost feels like i was. i saw them a while ago by coincidence in an art gallery and i had to control myself not to spiral into a panic attack. i don't know if it's actual trauma, since technically it was not real. but it felt SO REAL. i still have no clue what all of this means.\ni'm starting to think i absorb people's feelings or bad experiences in my dreams. i had a dream in which i killed myself with an acquaintance just to find out she was feeling suicidal the other day. i had dreams of people crying and then talking to them i would find out they were having a bad time mentally that day.\nsorry if it's a bit of a weird ass story, but i just needed to put it somewhere. thanks for reading."

What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\ni'm 21 years old turning 22 this year. i'm a female. i'm a college student, i love staying in my personal space, i don't speak a lot and i especially don't speak at all especially when i'm not by myself. my friends even joke around saying \"oh, you were here all this time?\" (which i sometimes don't like) people like me because of my calm and unbothered exterior (basically i'm the \"chill guy\")\n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nnot that i know of\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nupbringing... i dont really recall a lot from my childhood. what i know is that our family isn't the type to show physical affection or even emotion. we arent those kinds of families who kiss each other and say i love you. my mom is more religious than us for sure but i never really followed her that way in terms of religiousness. basically my life was more structured before compared to now. since i'm already an adult i can decide for myself without my family telling me otherwise.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\ni have no job yet since i'm still in college, but i'll become a physical therapist in the future hopefully. i don't like it just because of the whole learning process, but i think the job itself is okay. i was only in it for the money tbh but it grew on me the more i progressed. my original dream job was to become a musician or a performer.\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\ni would feel refreshed for sure. Quarantine proved self isolation as heaven to me hahaha\n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI'd prefer indoor activities more. But if given a chance to experience something from outdoors,  i would consider it.\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\ni'm curious to the point where i would sacrifice sleep just to get the answers i want. i have A LOT of ideas, for sure. but i execute them only when it is possible. My curiosities are usually about the human mind. (basically psychology). i really love everything about psychology, and i'm just getting started with mbti. My ideas are usually conceptual. again, i have a lot of ideas in my head, and those ideas are usually concerning about the mind\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\ni don't really enjoy taking on a leadership position since i'm quite the lazy type or maybe the task we're given isn't what i'm really confident in, but i naturally move as a leader when i see that no one is stepping up to be a leader or when our leader isn't doing his/her job properly. \n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI didn't really realize this before, but i am quite uncoordinated. I can't even catch a mosquito with my bare hands and i always either destroy fragile things or accidentally throw my phone too hard cause i can't handle my strength that much. Hands-on activities? I don't really have any interest in doing something hands-on but if i'm given a task that requires it, i tend to do good. \n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\ni do think that i'm artistic. since i have a lot of ideas in my head (mostly scenarios), i express those idea by writing short stories. i also sing and dance as a medium to appreciate music. \n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\npast is in the past, present is what you are now, and future is what you will become. as much as they're all interconnected in shaping up your whole identity as a person, they still have this kind of distinctness wherein they would be different. just because you have a past doesn't mean you are what you are now. just because you are like this in the present doesn't mean you will continue to be like this in the future. it's complicated but it's true. i deal with them separately too. for the past, i don't really dwell on it since they're done. for the present, i don't really live my life to the fullest. basically all i've been thinking now is planning what i'll do next in the future.\n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\ni would say \"okay sure, what do you want help with?\" cause why not? it's not a big deal unless they're keeping me from doing what i'm currently focused on doing\n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life? \n\nyes.\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nfor efficiency, i believe that straying away to the point of the problem isn't gonna do any good. if you're faced with a problem, solve it immediately cause some problems in real life are time limited. if you spend time finding solutions, you fail. in the case of productivity, yes it is very important too since both efficiency and productivity is correlated to each other. if you have increased productivity, you have great efficiency.\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\ni'm not consciously aware most of the time, but when i think about it, i tend to control others indirectly especially when i see that the people around me aren't good at what they're doing. take for example about the leader thingy. the deadline was near and no one's moving to initiate or take the leader's position that's why i naturally ended up initiating planning the whole thing and telling people what they should do\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nSinging, watching reaction videos either about kpop or games, playing mobile games, watching anime or kdramas or korean tv shows.\n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\ni learn a lot better in visual and auditory aspects. i have a hard time learning in unorganized spaces, noisy environments and i clearly prefer to learn alone than with study groups. i've really tried to engage in study groups because they said it helped them learn a lot, but it didn't really work for me so i could say that i learn a lot best when i'm by myself. hmmm i would prefer classes that would involve logic and creativity.\n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI'm definitely bad at improvising and doing tasks on impulse. I usually plan ahead about which of the following tasks i should do first. I usually segregate it according to its importance. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nprofessionally, my aspiration would be to become successful (and rich, might i add). personally, i aspire to be just... a better me.\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nmy fears? idk what its called but i have a fear of falling over those wide gaps that are only covered with plank wood or steel because they might snap in half and i'll fall. but i'm not afraid of heights though. what makes me uncomfortable is people invading my personal space because of the fact that it is my personal space. i don't like it when people around me can't match my pace when doing things. i absolutely hate injustice because it just reminds me how pathetic people of authority are. i literally hate close-minded people with passion because they don't consider other people's perspectives and would only believe to what they think is right like, wtf.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nachieving all the goals i've been planning, like finally buying that one thing ive been wanting to buy after months of saving up.\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nit looks nothing on the outside but it's chaos on the inside. basically an unhealthy social isolation. it happens when i fail in my class\n\n\u2022\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\ni'm mostly out of reality. i daydream alot especially these days that i'm granted a break from my workloads. i'm usually not aware since i'm too focused and i cant multitask.\n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\ni do have something to do. they're all in my head. i would probably have a monologue during that whole duration.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI don't really give it much importance and would decide quick when it isn't an urgent situation. However for an important situation, i usually weigh in the pros and cons first and think whether this decision would be the best or not.\n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nI do know which emotion i feel the first moment it hits me but i don't show them outside unless i've assessed the situation and confirm whether or not it's appropriate to let them out. But usually i don't really show them. \n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nyes, sometimes. it's either because that person is too close minded tthat contradicting them just won't be worth it or because i don't know the topic and would want them to keep going so that i would get new information and understand it.\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nyes. i do break rules when i think that the rules are dumb and ineffective in dealing with the problem. authorities tend to make rules to give them reasons to punish people without any logical reason to."

But the training isn't fun. Especially when I go on YouTube to watch videos and learn specific mechanics and see these beautiful, intricate, custom maps. I want to play those. How do I do so? I don't. \n\nRocket league is currently on 7 different platforms. Namely: Switch, Xbox one, Xbox series x, ps4, ps5, epic games, and finally, steam. Where can these maps be found? \"Players who own a copy of the Steam version of\u00a0Rocket League\u00a0for the PC will be able to download and play on custom maps\" \n\nWell shucks, I guess I'll have to get a pc to run rocket league. But wait, there's more! \"the Steam version is no longer for sale.

I'm not even a new player and it frustrates me. These content creators bring entirely new ways to play your game to you, yet not one single person who joined after free to play went live will experience them unless something is done about it. Make all maps available on all the platforms that can physically run them and you'll have a grateful player-base, new and old."

                "body": "Hey reddit, longtime destiny fan wanting to share my thoughts on destiny now, in the past, and in the future. I'd like to consider myself the target audience for destiny as I usually play just enough to get things done by the end of the season. Somewhere between casual and hardcore, I suppose. \n\nI'll get started by saying that since destiny 1s release, it's been a long Rollercoaster of excitement and disappointment. I see so many people that love destiny, it's lore, and it's mechanics, but burn themselves out by playing activities until they're so repetitive that their desire to play and their enjoyment is weakened. Allow me to make a loose comparison. On 11/11/11 a behemoth of a game was released. Having been at least three years in development, Skyrim was a very enjoyable experience from the start. With a world full of things to discover, players would spend hundreds of hours exploring the world to unearth it's secrets. Destiny, at launch, was not like skyrim. It had so little to offer at the start. 10 hours of story, maybe. And after 4 years of development! This is where this story could have ended. Some of you might even think that it should have. Personally, I didn't pick it up again until after more content was added. But these developers, unlike those who created games like Skyrim, were developing a changing world, an experience that I believe is unlike any other. \n\nHere's the thing. The last dlc for skyrim came out late 2012 and development basically halted to work on other projects in 2013. Not so for destiny. My fellow enthusiasts, destiny has been in development since 2010 and has not stopped attempting to expand. There have been times in destiny where we were so engaged in the world, the raids, the exotics, and the secrets that we felt like we couldn't put it down. Many of us, myself included, have thousands of hours dedicated to this game. Games like Skyrim, in my opinion, do not have that kind of playability. So why, then, are games like skyrim so revered, when destiny continues to be viewed as a second rate game? I believe there are a number of reasons for this, but foremost, I think the difference lies in the development. I think our opinion on destiny has been soured by expectation. \n\nWhy do you play destiny? We all have our reasons. Mine come in the form of memories with friends, staying up and doing raids until 3 in the morning. I know I'm not the only one who chases that feeling to this day. These memories are the reason that I consider destiny to be an overall success. That being said, destiny is nothing like skyrim. Destiny is no one-off and I'd argue that there is no \"base\" game anymore. It has changed so much. \n\nThis brings me back to my initial point. Destiny is a train ride, not a stop along the way. To me, it isn't a place that you can stay, it's a trip that you take. We've had some rough trips, we've hopped off at stations to get back on later. I want to tell you that that is okay. Don't let FOMO get you down, if you don't enjoy the season, hop off for a bit, catch the train the next time around. Wait for the vaulted content if you're unsatisfied now. I think bungie has been playing catch-up ever since ftp released. We can't change that. We can, however, be constructive with our criticism and patient with its implementation. There's a lot of work to do on destiny without the addition of new content, a lot of which\u00a0 we know will be addressed this year. The season loop might be tiring and not exciting at the moment. Maybe we're kinda upset about sunsetting. Maybe we were using all of the content in d2 and we're upset that we don't have it right now. Maybe we're tired of dying to shatterdive. I get it. I'm there with you and sometimes the best thing is to step away for a while. But in the end, I love this game and many of you do to. I look forward to 2021 in d2 and what it will bring. Whatever your choice, stay or go, guardians like myself are happy to have you and hope to see you again. \n\n\nTL;DR: destiny overall has been a good experience. It will keep progressing and changing, so if you feel overwhelmed (or underwhelmed) it might be beneficial to stop playing for a while. \n\n*Disclaimer: These are just thoughts and opinions, please be kind."

For example, in this small test, I added \"Hello!\" text to the screen.\n\nFor some reason, \"Hello!\" is truncated, but \"Hello!!\" is not. Nor is \"Hello!!!!!!!!!\" It seems counterintuitive that adding a character would somehow allow it to fit more easily on the screen.\n\nIn Paul Hudson's flag guessing program, I noticed the same issue with \"Estonia,\" so I added a space before and after so that the text read \" Estonia \" which fixed the truncated text. This makes absolutely no sense to me, and I don't want to have to use odd workarounds.\n\nWhile I've run across fixes (*.minimumScaleFactor(0.99)*, I'd like to know the root issue (the *why*) behind this odd behavior, and a way to permanently fix it, or at least know why SwiftUI has this built in error with its functionality. Is it something I'm doing wrong?\n\nEDIT: Here's a screenshot [https://imgur.com/a/0vwacyf](https://imgur.com/a/0vwacyf)"

From the corner of my eye, I spot it--a post indicating a user hasn't uploaded their Dartmouth peer evaluation. \"Dartmouth w-w-wha-\" I stutter. \"A peer evaluation?\" I furrow my brow. \n\nA quick Google search reveals that I had missed something important in my prior research. I need someone to vouch for my friendliness, quirkiness, warmth, empathy, and compassionate qualities. My eyes dart to the worn out calendar barely hanging onto the tack above my bed. \"December 20th,\" I say aloud. I sigh. I close my eyes. \"I've made a mistake.\"\n\n\\*car tire screeeeech to halt the dramatic plot\\*\n\nOkay, so I clearly missed this whole \"peer eval.\" I have absolutely no idea who I can get to write a peer evaluation right now, so close to the deadline, in the middle of the holidays. What is everyone here's thoughts on asking a significant other to write the letter? I wouldn't want her to write it as just a friend, as that's probably what everyone does, and I think the honesty might actually help my case. I found a handful of people on College Confidential who got in with their S/O writing it, so it's clearly not grounds for disqualification or anything *that* drastic. \n\nIn terms of the obvious bias that it would present, isn't that the point of the peer review? Picking another peer, such as my best friend, would be *just* as biased as my girlfriend. It's just that she has more time on her hands at the moment than the best friend does. Also, she was my friend for years before she was my girlfriend, so I think she could offer stories about the time before we began dating.\n\nThere's a 90% chance I'll be going with her anyway, as I don't think I have much of a choice. Just seeing if everyone here was absolutely full-on against it or had any thoughts on how to execute it.\n\n**TL;DR** \\-- Thoughts on a S/O writing a peer review? & What's the best way to execute this if I decide to do so?"

I also feel like I am obligated to act like I am over it too. I even thought that it would not come back like this, but that was before Junior year started.\n\nWhat do I do?"

Yes criticism for the game might be good, but instead of complaining, calm down, and think.\n\nAn example: \nTom, a Samus player is playing against a snake player, he's been winning neutral and getting good punishes off openings, because he is winning he decides to camp a bit and charge his neutral b, the snake throws grenades, but Tom has fast reactions and blocks them. He finishes charging his shot and shoots it at the desperate snake that is trying to run in, only thing is the grenade on the ground blocks his shot, blows up and doesn't even touch the snake, the snake runs in and uptilts and evens out the game.\n\nTom, frustrated, starts to run in carelessly and eventually loses the game, he then complains about snake being overpowered, never actually learning why he lost.\n\nWhat he should've done is calm down, take note of that interaction, try not to blame the game but rather adapting to this new learned information, stick to his gameplan and after that do some research on snake.\n\nTo get good at this game you have to have a very good mentality. This game is bullshit and bullshit things will happen. But it's important to remember that everything has counterplay and everything can be adapted to. Getting heat up in the moment is okay sometimes but it's important to remember that you, as a player have control of everything that is happening, instead of thinking: \"Why did he fall out of my fair? This game is so bad!\" Think: \"Why did he fall out of my fair? Should've I spaced it better? Maybe it's because I did it while fading back?\".\n\nYou become a lot better at this game when you stop making excuses and actually try to understand the game deepper mechanics and start to adapt rather than blame the game.\n\nCalling a particular character or matchup impossible to beat is the thing that makes it impossible to beat, it sets a mental block in your mind that keeps you away from a positive, learning mindset and gives you a very negative one instead.\n\nJust remember this advice: don't complain, adapt.\n\nThat is all."

Though you might need some patience with auto focus with them. They are 90s camera so in dark areas they have hard time focusing. Also, many of them have pretty \u201cslow lenses\u201d so your image will be come out shaky if you do not hold them stable.\n\nOf course, if you want something more reliable but user friendly, you could go automatic SLRs. Like Canon EOS, Nikon automatic SLRs. They are similar(or almost identical) to modern DSLRs and for Nikon F mount and Canon EF mounts you can mount modern lenses or 90s autofocus lenses with them. They are as cheap as point and shoot cameras, but much bigger and heavier. The most advanced one is Nikon F6, which was produced until 2020.\n\nOther choices are rather \u201cnot 90s\u201d - cheap autoexposure rangefinders(sometimes only viewfinder; you have to guess the distance to set the focus). They are great but compared to first two I\u2019ve mentioned, not that beginner friendly - just like rangefinders in general.\n\nLastly there are more expensive options - Contax G series, Leica Minilux, Konica Hexar AF or RF, etc. These are sure user friendly but way too expensive.",

Effects were mostly subtle so I think they are not that noticeable unless I upload original negatives, but I think they came out fine, except for that horrible easel and paper placement. I really should pay attention to it...\n\nSpilt grading was easier than I thought, really. It was basically exposing same paper in different grading and time, thus manipulating image to get more shadow details out or give more contrast to the sky. Though, first two pictures and negatives already had hard contrast and no detail in the sky whatsoever - it was very clear day - I should try mix of spilt grading and burning to get the details of atmosphere instead.\n\nCropping was very simple, very easy - basically raise the enlarger. Of course, I had to expose my paper longer, and image came out extremely grainy. I guess if I wanted more detail then I should use lower ISO film with more dense grain.\n\nNow dodge and burning was completely different experience. I thought manipulating exposure time with my hands would result in unnatural difference in contrast and brightness, but to my surprise they came out actually ok. I used number 5 filter, so image is super contrasty and that might hide some mistakes. Next, I might have to try to mix spilt grading with dodge and burning, so I can manipulate my prints however I want to.\n\nNow I remember when I watched documentary of Moriyama Daido, he said \"I can't remember how I printed\" - I can totally understand it. If I ever mixed spilt grading, dodge and burning and cropping etc, I don't think I could remember all the details as well.",

                "body": "I'm working in an investigative government agency with a building erected around 1960s. I'm pretty new since I started 2018 but since my dad is a criminologist and my uncle is a chemist. I kinda grew up roaming the said building (it's not really that strict when the entire office knows you're an employee's kid.) \n\n1. First is the creepy forensic hall in my uncle's office floor. The 3rd floor is a mixed of chemistry and forensic lab (medico legal). It was a weekend so the entire building is nearly empty, save for some roaming janitors and guards. I tagged along with my father, who works on weekend, like I often do when the weather is bad and couldn't play outside. I think I was a little nagging so he told me to go greet my uncle instead. That being said, I packed some comic books and carried my dog with me. Already when the elevator opened on that floor my dog started whimpering, but I only took it as he wants to be let go. So I did. And he bolted on the forensic wings (that's where autopsies are usually conducted and severed parts of victims stored). I fucking hate that wing. They have glass displays of human parts and fetuses and teeth and whatever the fuck they can recover from a corpse and stored it in big jars full of formalin. It didn't traumatized me but it sure does creeps me out. Some offices on that floor has frosted window/walls, so you can kinda see people inside during office hours. \nSo my dog ran on that part and since no one is on duty, the entire wing was dark. I switched on my phone's flashlight to look for my dog and only when I was halfway till the end of the wing I realized my dog is inside a fire exit, whimpering as if he's hurt. I'm a fairly brave girl and didn't believe in ghost but when I took another step, I feel my entire body ran cold. My dog's whimper grew louder like something is hurting him. I attempted to march towards the fire exit but my flashlight caught a silhouette of man standing inside one of the office with frosted glass walls. He is tall, kinda robust and very still so I know it's not just my scrawny shadow being reflected. I thought maybe a janitor so I, again, tried to take another step but the silhouette walked towards the glass wall.He was just standing for a few seconds, about a meter away. I know it's a ghost so I ran away and that figure seemed to run with me, almost catching up inside the wall adjacent to me. \n\nI was like having a panic attack. I get to my uncle's office screaming and crying and blubbering words. They have to get 2 guards to take my dog from the exit and good news is he wasn't hurt or anything.  Ah my dad was so worried he made my brother pick me up. I binged watch SpongeBob that night to get that silhouette off of my head. And I also sleep with lights on starting then. \n\n2. The veiled lady on the 5th floor. \n\nThis happened September 2018 and I'm not the only witness now. We have an office party in a nearby bar and my officemate, who I will call 'Jenny', left our bags in the office with then intention of getting it after the party (I mean, c'mon, who likes to bring heavy bags in a party \u2014and we don't have car btw). It was only around 7 pm. The elevators are not functioning for whatever damn reason so we took the staircase to the 7th floor where our office is. Between the fifth floor and the fourth floor, we tried to catch our breath (we've been walking non stop). I was joking about getting old and our lame stamina and Jenny was chuckling until she stopped all of sudden. I glanced at her and she was staring wide eye on the fifth floor.  So i looked where she was looking and then there it was, walking back and forth, a shadow figure of a lady with a veil. I swear we're so stupid and tired that we stare at it for a good 5 seconds (probably 10 seconds for Jenny)(and damn that figure just kept walking back and forth) before we bolted away. Yep we took the fire exit, and yep we dragged a friend in the same floor to come down with us. Needless to say, I work early to also leave early. And it's been like that till now. \n\nThe good news, folks. I will be transferring to another office. Hopefully new and not haunted."

You would think that after a long time interest in meditation and productivity I would have realized this sooner, but the primal brain is very persuasive. I've been on a year-long journey of trying to maximize my productivity, but I really hadn't made much headway until now. I pinned my constant failure to reach my goals on lack of will power or motivation. Now it seems obvious that every time I opened Snapchat or decided I needed a snack while I should have been studying, it was just lack of mindfulness. I think that realizing this deep fear of boredom opens the door to all aspects of self improvement and productivity."

The only logical conclusion to this information is that taste, to humans, is much more than flavour, so boiling the matter down to just flavour is reductive.\n\nIn a way this is obvious, especially if you use some analogies (imperfect ones though they are). For example, a woman or man is in front of you with the \"dream body\" (whatever that means for you). If you dress him or her in sexy clothing then I would debate that they become more attractive than they were before. If you dress them in your vision of un-sexy clothing then, of course, the appeal diminishes. You can interpret the clothes, whether sexy or not, to be representative of not just the packaging of a food, but all of the cultural conditioning over the course of your lifetime that leads you to have certain beliefs and presuppositions about colour, sound, style, flavour etc.\n\nThat example was horribly imperfect, but it's one other comparable instance of this phenomenon. Another one is music. The context one listens to music in has astronomically powerful impacts on one's taste in the moment.\n\nJust because flavour has more hard science going on, in regards to the nutritional and bio-chemical profile of food and drink, it definitely doesn't mean that it's objectivity far surpasses that of our perceptions of attractiveness in others or of good quality music. Accept that all of our senses succumb to the beck and call of our presuppositions and we can understand that most of appreciation for anything is down to whether or not our brain tells is it's good or not. \n\nThat's why mindfulness is so effective for quality of life! It stops the automatic labelling of experiences as bad and gives us an opportunity to experience the pleasure that was previously unavailable to us.",

I'm a first time rat owner, so I could be making some ignorant mistakes."

This is largely due to battling with an eating disorder and finding it hard to keep a more balanced diet, so the candida comes back and I eventually go through another wave of die-off when things stabilise again.\n\nThe last couple of die-offs have produced a brand new symptom for me though, a persistent salty taste in my mouth. Not only has this symptom coincided clearly with die-off periods, but it also appears to be highly responsive to  the fluctuations in that period. For example, during a die-off phase if I overeat one night then the salty taste will disappear soon after eating and it will only return after a day or so has passed if I stabilised my diet in the meantime.\n\nThis has been a startlingly consistent phenomenon, to the extent where I have become very grateful for its presence as a symptom because it far outshines any other symptom I've identified in the past that can help me to ascertain if I'm in die-off and to what extent it is occurring.\n\nI remain critical about it, despite the anecdotal evidence, and have been trying to find anything online that can validate and explain the concurrence of this salty taste in my mouth and candida die-off. \n\nHave any of you experienced this, or heard of someone who has? Or might be able to provide some hypotheses for its existence? I would be very grateful. Thank you for reading!"

You can either do what you want or do nothing (relaxation) in that time. But if you\u2019re getting paid to do what you want, then all of the time spent working is \u201ctime off,\u201d because you\u2019re doing what you want. So why would making more money matter at that point unless you needed more of it to fuel what you want?\n\nMaking more could mean working 80 hours a week at a job you hate and retire early just to be too burned out to do what you were once passionate about. Or it could mean taking the time to get the credentials for a job where you\u2019re making a lot of money at 40 hours per week with time left over to do what you want- but there\u2019s a catch if you\u2019re the type of person to have personal goals and want a family or even a social life. Outside of work time, you have to choose one or the other. Balancing the two requires a herculean effort that is possible but hard. You can hardly be relaxed in the mindset required for this. If you get the balance wrong and prioritize your personal goals your family life will suffer, and your goals will suffer if you prioritize family or even friends because they will eat the time necessary for your goals, or really anything that you want to do. You could do what you want together, but that assumes that everybody in board, and even if you can try to find a partner that likes what you like, if you have kids they might not like what you do, or want you to spend time doing a what they like.\n\n\nSorry to be so descriptive, but there was no other way to get the point across without misconstruing what I was trying to say.",

Honestly my husband does more than I do.\n\nPostpartum depression was hell for me and he needed a LOT of medical attention early in his life, so he cried a lot. In the early colic stages he either slept or cried, and that was it. Noise is one aspect - I tolerated the crying relatively well, - the broken sleep on the other hand was worse. I wish I had heard a bit more that \"fed is best\" but I was in a hospital that was super pushy on breastfeeding whereas I wasn't sure I wanted that. It took us ages before we found a bottle he would take but once my husband could take shifts with me it was such a relief. I wish I had listened to my instinct and went with formula but being autistic it's often hard to know what you want and I ended up being overruled by nurses and doctors a lot.

This has happened every week or so since I was 34 weeks, I'm now 39.\n\nIs there anything that I can do about this? Because it's exhausting physically and mentally. I feel some level of pain, can't walk well, can't do much aside from staying home which is slowly driving me nuts - and mentally it's fine when I imagine myself holding my baby soon but when it's been 15 hours of this then haha nope nothing, it's hard not to cry the next morning that it was all in vain and you'll have to do it again. \n\nI also feel dismissed by the medical team that they aren't \"real\" contractions, sure it's not active labour, but I've heard from several other women that they whole \"you can't talk through the real ones\" isn't always correct. Given that I've often missed signs of fainting, being overly stressed or having physical injuries and other bodily signals I just don't \"feel\" stuff easily in my own body (being autistic doesn't help).

I don\u2019t need to be told to do better or whatever else, I\u2019m already calling myself a fuck up because I just fuck things up. Things I really want, things that my heart is into\u2026. Been burned way too many times.\n\nMy parents were hypercritical of me, and there\u2019s things I work on but I keep for myself. I can\u2019t deal with high praise. I can\u2019t deal with critical and I can\u2019t deal with passive aggression.\n\nI wasn\u2019t allowed feelings either so I learned growing up to bottle them up. Till I just lose it, because either there\u2019s too much or it\u2019s been there too long. I\u2019m a fearful avoidant, and a lot of anxious and avoidant too\u2026 very little secure\u2026 and my ACE score is 7 or 8 and I\u2019m managing to work a full time job\u2026 somehow.\n\nI live in my head. That\u2019s how I survived growing up and the therapist said it was fine to keep using it for now as a coping mechanism. But I keep wondering\u2026 is that really helping?\n\nI would love some of my reality to be close to what others got here (by here I mean other folks going to things\u2026 and actually getting decent). Even when I try, it\u2019s not enough. I work myself into the ground and have been learning not to so when I get disappointed it hurts less. Which in turn makes it less likely for me to get what I want for myself and keeps going on that cycle instead. .. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m even making sense?\n\nI have a feeling everything relates, but I have no idea how to help myself. The closest I got was a mentor from many years ago\u2026 and then everything fell apart due to abuse from elsewhere and I feel so gone, worthless, sad. I\u2019ve been in therapy for years (6? Solid CBT for awhile and then EMDR for the last\u2026 1.5?) and been in support groups - CoDA, Al-annon\u2026 and it\u2019s like\u2026 sigh. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice/emotional support? \n\nThanks for reading.

I will list their names I can think of as much as I could\n\n* Thalgard\n* Fogville\n* Silvergrove\n* Northwind\n* Foamville\n* Goldenfrost area\n* Throatstone area\n* Powder Cliff\n* Some abandoned taverns (Tavern at the Penny Road, The Hollow Hand etc.)\n* Whisperwood area\n* Isle of Kor\n* Fortress Rockwatch\n* Etc.\n\nPretty sure there are more of them but this is all I can think of.

Friend did the assignment misgendering themself and then just fucked off out of class to cry somewhere. Later got scolded by the teacher for running off like that, and now the teacher wants to talk to them. I told them to not go to that teacher, he can fuck right off. Supporting my ass. If he asks why not talk, they've said they'll answer something like \"Oh, I thought you could see?\"\n\nFriend is really mad at him now, doesn't even care about being outed anymore because he probably has guessed it by now, and they will be going to the principal to explain this and hopefully someone will tell the teacher to stop doing that or something.\n\nThank you again for the advice and support.

The assignment is talking about yourself. Not just anything, specifically your gender. This friend of mine though is still questioning, leaning more male/enban right now (they're afab) \n\nThe assignment is basically describe yourself like this:\n\n\"I am Jamie, I am a man. I feel like a man. My pronouns are he/him and I love women\"\n\nMy friend is on the verge of crying because of this. They're still figuring it out, aren't out to anyone except me because I'm FTM and they felt safe telling me. School isn't so safe though. That teacher is a wonderful, accepting man. But I'm afraid he does not seem to see the weight this assignment can have on some people and how stupid it is in general. Friend their classmates are also pretty homophobic/transphobic. They at no cost want to out themselves to any teacher because they want to figure themselves out first, and they don't want to risk being outed to everyone.\n\nThey have no \"safe adult person\", no idea how to handle it. If I had any way to contact said teacher I would just out myself at the cost of helping others cuz I already graduated a while ago, but I have no way to contact him and the assignment is tomorrow.\n\nSaid friend can't stay at home, not showing up would only delay the assignment anyway. Sending a mail to the teacher isn't an option either because they have a specific app for that and you have only your account so they know who send it, which outs said person. No friends or anything to send in their place. Last resort would be misgendering themselves but that would take a great toll on their mental health and would rather be avoided. \n\nSo, any advice? This whole assignment is just bullshit because I am pretty sure any person, cis or trans, is not happy with this. I am glad I graduated before this could happen to me I'd be throwing the damn table through the roof."

Most of the cut is now closing a bit but has a yellowish color, but a little part is still not closed and has some red around it. It doesn't hurt at all but I am terrified that it might be infected.\n\nPut a bandaid on it and then the bandage and am just hoping it doesn't get stuck again. Any advicr on what to do next? I want to avoid a doctor or hospital at all costs please. The cut is at this point 2,5 days old so I'm hoping it'll just close but I'm terrified it won't.\n\nTL;DR: Paper and bandage got stuck in wound multiple times and I think it might be slightly infected. What can I do without going to a doctor or hospital? \n\nNever had this happen in the 3 years I've done this, maybe the crust got yellow at most but not like this."

I'm getting back into gaming after playing on a shitty laptop for years.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any tips I could save a bit of money on, or if I shouldn't compromise and just fork out the cash (which is ok).\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/VV3Vht)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 3.8 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/qtvqqs/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-38-ghz-8-core-processor-100-100000063wof) | $592.36 @ Amazon Australia \n**CPU Cooler** | [Corsair iCUE H100i RGB PRO XT 75 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/B6pmP6/corsair-icue-h100i-rgb-pro-xt-75-cfm-liquid-cpu-cooler-cw-9060043-ww) | $167.77 @ JW Computers \n**Motherboard** | [\\*Gigabyte X570 GAMING X ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/LJxbt6/gigabyte-x570-gaming-x-atx-am4-motherboard-x570-gaming-x) | $168.77 @ JW Computers \n**Memory** | [\\*G.Skill Ripjaws V 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3600 CL16 Memory](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/zcH8TW/gskill-ripjaws-v-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr4-3600-memory-f4-3600c16d-32gvkc) | $257.10 @ Newegg Australia \n**Storage** | [\\*Western Digital Green 1 TB 2.5\" Solid State Drive](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/rJhKHx/western-digital-green-1-tb-25-solid-state-drive-wds100t2g0a) | $114.77 @ JW Computers \n**Video Card** | [Asus Radeon RX 6800 XT 16 GB Video Card](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/HY4BD3/asus-radeon-rx-6800-xt-16-gb-video-card-tuf-rx6800xt-o16g-gaming) | $1949.00 @ PC Byte \n**Case** | [Fractal Design Define R5 ATX Mid Tower Case](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/yQ7CmG/fractal-design-case-fdcadefr5wt) | $180.00 \n**Power Supply** | [\\*Silverstone Strider Gold S V2 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/JNH8TW/silverstone-strider-gold-s-v2-850-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-sst-st85f-gs-v2) | $139.00 @ PCCaseGear \n**Operating System** | [Microsoft Windows 10 Home OEM 64-bit](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/wtgPxr/microsoft-os-kw900140) | $167.00 @ Amazon Australia \n**Sound Card** | [Asus Xonar SE 24-bit 192 kHz Sound Card](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/HDHRsY/asus-xonar-se-24-bit-192-khz-sound-card-xonar-se) | $59.00 @ JW Computers \n**Wired Network Adapter** | [Asus XG-C100C PCIe x4 10 Gbit/s Network Adapter](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/7z4NnQ/asus-xg-c100c-network-adapter-xg-c100c) | $149.00 @ Centre Com \n**Monitor** | [Asus TUF Gaming VG27AQ 27.0\" 2560x1440 165 Hz Monitor](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/pGqBD3/asus-tuf-gaming-vg27aq-270-2560x1440-165-hz-monitor-vg27aq) | $509.00 @ JW Computers \n**Keyboard** | [Cherry G80-11900 Series Compact Keyboard Wired Standard Keyboard With Touchpad](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/VWkD4D/cherry-keyboard-g8011900ltmus0) | $228.08 @ Amazon Australia \n**Mouse** | [Zowie EC2-eVo WHITE Wired Optical Mouse](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/FnkD4D/zowie-mouse-ec2evowhite) |-\n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | **Total** | **$4680.85**\n | \\*Lowest price parts chosen from parametric criteria |\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2021-11-04 11:44 AEDT+1100 |"

I want to create the art that I want to create, not be told to respond to something. Of course responding to themes is normal but this feels too specific and restrictive. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?"

                "body": "Now that I am home I can write a more detailed explanation on this.\n\nIf we look at this site (https://www.plantation-productions.com/Webster/www.artofasm.com/DOS/ch03/CH03-3.html#:~:text=Altogether%2C%20the%20mov%20instruction%20takes,memory%20(one%20clock%20cycle).)\n\nYou'll notice that instructions take a certain amount of cycles and not many take 1 (looking at you nop)\n\nBasically this varies from chip to chip depending on its design. Beyond the chance problem which I'll get to later it's going to take a while to get an instruction done (I'm using mov as an example here) however looking at Intel's website you can see a wide variety of architecture on its i5 chips (https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/core_i5) but regardless you still have to abide by the architecture of the chip it doesn't change (unless you get a new chip which defeats the purpose of buying this server rack)\n\nTherefore no matter what you do it's static (again avoid cache right now)\n\nSo in this case where we avoid the more or less random chance of cache the only thing that matters on the same architecture is it's clock speed.\n\nNow the nitty gritty\nProcessors have memory in them.\n(https://teivah.medium.com/go-and-cpu-caches-af5d32cc5592) see the image.\n\nBecause a CPU will not always have what it needs in l1 or l2 it may need to go to other locations to gather that data therefore may be faster or slower but that is a result of where the data is stored and is not perfect. When you cpu grabs data it thinks is on l1 but isn't it's called a cache miss and it spends more cycles calling the lower memory and checking if it is there. This is why cache sizes matter as well but when this happens it slows down the process. \n\nBut again this is unavoidable\n\nWe also have to consider instructions because they are different among different cpus some may be faster or slower than others and without a perfect breakdown of every single instruction Minecraft takes we will never know what mix is in there. Therefore a CPU might have more instructions per cycle (or more accurately the other way around) but other cpus might have different faster instructions. Each instruction is not as fast as the other and unless provided with a breakdown of how much each instruction is used we cannot be sure if we are getting the ipc we are striving for.\n\n\nSo going back to the clock argument there is a lot of variation that short of getting a different cpu you can't control and getting a different cpu defeats the point of buying the server. While it's fair to say that instructions per cycle or more accurately cycles per instruction is a good measure it's prone to being varied by the cpu design instruction set and other factors out of their control. You are correct don't get me wrong but in a realistic sense there is no real reason to consider cpi considering it's up to the design of the cpu and some chance. While it's more accurate I suppose to describe in cpi clock rate is easier because it carriers less info about architecture and cache and the other results that may affect it.\n\n\nSo to tldr cpi is more accurate however cpi varies by instruction and cache and the likes\n\nClock rate however is constant (not actual with Intel turbo boost and the likes but a clock is a clock an instruction has to have different cycles per execution and it if loads or reads data there is a cache to content with)\n\nSo yes cpi is accurate \nBut clock rate is easier to interpret and not subject to the whims of cpu design or cache misses",

If we consider the jump instruction for example than it's only a few cycles of work right but if we have more cycles in a second we can do more jump instructions per second.\n\nTherefore the amount of instructions you do per second is tied with clock speed and how many cycles per instruction. You cant really tweak that second part unless you want to design your own CPU so the best thing you have is clock speed and therefore clock speed does affect it.",

                "body": "Best tip I can give you for heat management is to use nat gas in storage. Batteries slowly leak charge and that charge produces heat. The bigger storage the more heat. This is how most of my bases worked untill recently.\n\nIf you find a gyser for natural gas store the gas not the electricity. The gas doesn't leak off and it's not a battery so it wouldn't produce heat (other than the temp the gas comes out at). Then automate is as fast as possible with a smart battery (it sends signals to machines when low on power and is more efficient). You only need 1 battery. Basically what it should do is burn gas when you need power or your battery runs low and do nothing otherwise.\n\n\nThe amount of heat reduced and power saved is immense.\n\nTo reduce heat because it will build up is also a challenges. You'll need a working fluid like pwater and an Aten and hydrogen gyser. Atens are machines found in ice biomes that delete heat using hydrogen. Hydrogen is not dense and the heat on it is deleted anyways when used so pumping hydrogen into a Aten is a good idea to keep everything cool. Then pump the working fluid in-between the base and your Aten. Make sure it doesn't freeze. That is the tricky part but when you manage to get oil you can use that as a working fluid it it's harder to freeze.\n\nA few people will say use an aqua tuner and steam turbine setup to cool a base. You can do that but it's rather complex and not easy to do for a while. Personally I use atens because they are easier the only hard part is finding a hydrogen vent to power it.\n\nYou can also use wheezeworts found in the ice biomes as they cool down the air. You'll need a lot of them to make a difference however and then you need a lot of phosphorus which you can get by farming dreckos (the fluffy things that climb walls). Keep them feed and you can maintain a lot of them. It's easier then an Aten but less powerful.",

Build those plates where most of the heat is and have the water drain either into a pool via mesh tiles or into a container and dump that into your water supply.\n\nNext for sustainability I prefer to go with a Aten setup. If you have a single hydrogen vent and a Aten anywhere all you need to do is a simple automation check and have a working fluid. P water will work.\n\nAs for water you will need a slush or steam gyser and cooling those can be a pain in the but without aquatuner. It's possible but not fun. It's possible but not fun. Wheeze works won't work well for cooling water as they act on gases which have low conductivity. Another Aten might work if you have one but otherwise you may need an aquatuner which you should use steel for.",

This manager was really laid back and clam so I chimmed in when I had something to say.\n\nI don't do this with my close friends really.\n\n I forget what it was that day but the manager said something somewhat funny and before I had a chance to even laugh the conversation was in a different topic. The issue is despite everyone else talking about something else I was still stuck on what the manager said to almost make me laugh to the point where if I didn't say anything about her comment letting her know I though it was funny I thought I would burst. I eventually found a time where no one was talking and told her I thought the joke was very funny but as it was so far past the conversation it didn't really make any sense context wise and she just kinda gave me an award thanks probably thinking \"why'd this person bring up a joke I made 30 minutes ago\". \n\nIt's things like this that I feel make conversation difficult. I have the same problem with my parents where if we are discussing something and I have a point to make but the time goes by I will have an urge to make this point even if the conversation is done and dusted.\n\nIt's lead to a lot of really award situations and I want to know if anyone else feels this or has any tips they might offer.\n\nPs.

But yeah, does anyone else deal with this? I have OCD and I feel like it's becoming a weird obsession and the compulsion is to test myself. Even when I'm asleep, apparently. I'd like to hear your stories or input if you'd like to share. I want to know if I'm alone or not and if you have experience with these feelings, how you deal with them. Thanks for reading."

                "body": "Hi, \n\nThe title sums it up pretty well, but to elaborate, I'm turning 26 soon. I've fooled around with a few guys but I only had one relationship last longer than a year, and another one last just a few months. Both of them were with men, and I know now that I'm a lesbian. It occurred to me that I never actually felt love and attraction to them on a deeper level. Looking back, it was superficial, like I had to Google what love is supposed to feel like and when you're supposed to have those feelings with a man. Sex was beyond unfulfilling and I dreaded it or zoned out completely, never enjoying it or actually wanting it vs. agreeing to it. I would get totally freaked out at the first kiss with any guy I dated or tried to hook up with and I seriously panicked and cried when they left. When I went along with it I was just going through the motions and just wanted to feel something. I never did. I've realized that I kinda admired those guys but mostly just appreciated a dependable person to have around. Now that I know about comphet, it makes sense. But I'm so sad about it all.\n\nI know 26 is probably young to many of you all here in this sub, but it still feels a little old to have never had a truly long term rewarding relationship by now. My younger brother is getting married in October, my dad is remarrying after 5 years, and my youngest brother is serious about his current relationship and wants to start a family some day. But then, there's me. Alone. And I know they worry about me for not having found someone to share my life with. \n\nI've become so pessimistic, especially with the pandemic, and that I'm back in college and everyone around me is at least 8 years younger than me and that makes me uncomfortable. I have no way of dating anyone or finding someone IRL. And the voice in my head is telling me that if I've never been in love by now, I might as well give up on it entirely and just accept that I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life.\n\nIt feels silly writing it out, but it really bothers me. I see people either IRL or in stories fall in love and I absolutely adore when characters or people fall for each other, but it makes me feel this empty pain in my chest, too.\n\nHas anyone else felt this way? Did you find someone depsite thinking you'd just end up by yourself? I feel lost. I'd love to hear your stories if you'd be so kind as to share them. Thanks for reading!"

Tonight I broke down again like I did a few months ago: I cried out for someone to have mercy on me, whether that's easing my suffering or taking my life. I'm still having chest pain from my breakdown and it feels like I'm seizing up inside. I hate this. I know that nobody can save me. And I can't save myself.\n\n I'm about to turn 26. My mental illnesses started to develop already as a child. I've been in and out of therapy and meds for a decade now but it never ends. Every day is so painful for me and it doesn't matter, all these years of insights and trying to reframe my thought processes have been bandaids on the festering wound that is my existence. I was abused as a child and life never got any better for me. It's been pretty shitty. I'm still trying to graduate college but every night I think of how I'm never going to make it and either ignore my mountain of missed assignments and classes or freak out because of how behind I am. \n\nI'm in a better place than I was in 2016-2017 when I was totally psychologically dependent on marijuana, not on meds or in therapy, and living with a self proclaimed sociopath and his Borderline gf. That was absolute hell. But even then, at least I could get blitzed and not worry about anything or think about anything. I dropped out a few times just to sit on our shitty couch and be high constantly. I almost miss it. I was running away from myself and totally unhealthy. But I miss it.\n\nNo matter how many pep talks I give myself, or how much encouragement or advice others give me, or what medications I'm maxxed out on, at the end of the day, I don't even remember what happiness is supposed to feel like.  Or even just a normal day. Everything just hurts. My thoughts are all catastrophic. All I can think about is giving up. About dropping out. About faking my death and running away or just actually taking my life. Honestly, the suicidal thoughts never go away. \n\nEveryone tells me about my potential. They all allude to me as being some type of genius without actually saying that word. They tell me I'm destined to have a bright future and make an impact on the world. But none of that matters when I'm curled up on the floor, scratching my chest because I wish I could rip out my own heart and stop having emotions. \n\nIdk where I'm going with this. I just really needed to write this. I'm way past when I should be asleep and I'm not even tired, just clutching my chest and trying to stop crying. I wish it could end. But I don't think it ever will. If it hasn't gotten better by now, it probably never will. It feels like the only rational end to inevitable and inescapable suffering is to choose not to be alive anymore. My ideations never come to fruition. For some reason, I keep going. It's just this internal drive I have. It's like an instinct to go forward and grow and succeed. It's like my feet move forward on their own while I'm dying inside. I don't think I will ever take my own life, but every day ends with me wishing I were no longer alive.\n\nI don't know what to do. Or if this will ever end. Or if there is any reason why I keep trying even when I want to give up. It never gets any better. If anything, it feels like insanity to keep going like this. I'm so tired. I'm lost. I don't think it's ever going to improve. I hope someone out there can prove me wrong. Or just be an example of it getting better, or just confirm that I will eternally feel this way, and what to do about it. Thanks for taking the time to read this."

Sorry for not being visible for so long, but we promise we do try to keep our eyes on you when we can.\n\nWe're here today to just try to address a few things: about our meetups and its future, our modmail, and addressing few affliate requests. and general policies. \n\n# **1) Meetups**\n\nThe question we get asked most is that whether we have plans to resume the meetup in some form or way. At the time of posting, **IRL meetings will be postponed indefinitely until COVID restrictions are lifted** -- it is not possible for spaces to provide location for us, and we feel that it's not appropriate to risk it. \n\n**Online**: There has been some talk about whether an online session is possible. We've been talking amongst ourselves about it, and basically it boils down to this -- are the hosts able to have enough capacity to host and moderate the content/progress? The simple answer is we simply don't have enough resources to give. The process of hosting and moderating is long and demanding.  And we apologise for that, and we hope you can understand. \n\n\n# **2) Moderation**\n\nNext -- there have been a significant amount of backlog in moderation, due to our process not being as streamlined as possible.\nWe would like to formally apologise to those who have sent modmails in and never gotten the replies, and also our negligence as mods. We will reply to the post that had come our way within the year with an active account, everything that's before that has more or less resolved itself or have not been active for a long time. If you'd like to follow up with that, please try the modmail again and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. We've been trying to change up the processes and I'm already in contact with someone for help. We will try to catch up with everything we should, and if we've missed something, please shoot us a PM. \n\nFor future modmail from individuals -- if you're not getting a fast enough respond, please do not hestitate to send direct PM to me, u/GrayySea. I usually will try to help out as much as I can. If I can't handle it personally, I'll delegate to someone else. \n\nFor non-individuals, refer to next point.\n\nNormal threads and reports are still being regularly attended. \n\n\n#**3) Affiliates**\n\nAny affiliates (include posting about your mental health related instagram, twitter, subreddit, page, blog, website, organisation) request is not unwelcomed, *but* we will have to screen your group and your page. We generally don't accept promoting posts very frequently. However, if you think your content is good for the subreddit, go ahead and post. If someone asks for your group, you may tell them. We're going to be quite lenient and hands off overall, so please try not to abuse it. \n\nPlease talk to us if you'd like to work together. Again, we don't reject mental health related groups and topics. \n\n#**4) Policies**\n\nWe feel appropriate to state that as a group, we will not engage public speaking engagements. This might change in the future, but for now, we will decline any and all invitation to speak. \n\n#**5) We need your help**\n\nIf you have experience as a subreddit mod and would like to help with the subreddit, please contact me directly so we can have a chat! We are looking for users who is willing to helpout with the subreddit side of things -- think theme/appearance, moderation ideas, general insights, etc. We're just like.... Kinda noob when it comes to this, so to speak. \n\n**TL;DR**: we're kinda swamped, we're sorry, please modmail/PM for anything, please no advertise, and please help if you have expertise on subreddit. \n\n\nThank you so much for your patience as community, as we navigate through this together. Your understanding and participation has helped us grow and gave us a huge sense of pride and honour. All your stories and your difficulties remind us every day that we are grateful that we're not alone. \n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions, ideas, options, please shoot it our way -- we will listen or address it if we can.  \n\n\n*With love,*  \n*MHP admin team.*"

It\u2019s outrageous and impossible to do so because the scope is so large. However, positive claims like the existence of god do have the burden of proof upon them. The existence of God should have some sort of evidence backing it it if true.*\n\nThat wouldn't apply as that's under the assumption that the concept of God is novel enough to require evidence. By all means, the concept of God epistemologically speaking is an axiom. Meaning the burden of proof is quite literally on no one.\n\nIt literally loops back to those who believe the concept has value to them subjective in contrast to those that it doesn't. The burden of proof depends on the circumstances.\n\nThe evidence of God's existence, to me at least, is rather logical yet not explicit enough per se. Particularly the contingency argument variation of the Kalam Cosmological argument.\n\n>*You are misrepresenting what Nietzsche was saying in quoting the famous \u201cGod is Dead\u201d line. His argument was that society was evolving beyond the point of basing its morality upon Christianity (and other Abrahamic faiths by extension). This was not some happy phenomena. It was a tortuous realization that now humanity had the responsibility of finding its own way forward independent of these beliefs.*\n\nThat's quite literally my point. I'm saying out of their own personal desire of what they ***don't*** want reality to be. Society has \"*evolved*\" in such a way that detaches itself from these faiths, hence secularism.\n\nThey ***don't*** want to live in a reality where the existence of Hellfire lies waiting at the end of the road. They'd rather sacrifice eternal Pleasure which in this case ins Paradise, if it meant that they can live however they like assuming it doesn't harm anyone.",

                "body": "AssalamuAlaykum,\n\nI have a problem when it comes to the concept known as \"*Haya'a*\" which if I recall is supposed to be correlative with \"*shyness*\". \n\nBut looking at the word in Arabic, especially its old and root association of what it actually means, it's often associated with \"*Hesitation in conscience.*\" Where you use your conscience to hesitate in doing wrong action, be it to speak out of line to your boss or as far as to get angry and lash at your own mother. These wrong actions need hesitation and patience. \n\nHowever, my question goes around the idea of whether is it only associated with what people say or is it also attributed to what they do as well. As, personally speaking, from a young age, I had so much \"*shyness*\" that I hesitated in everything that I had ever done. Resulting in a lack of \"***ItQa'n***\" also known as \"*Good quality work*\", so now as a young adult, that stage of hesitation is almost gone. During my teenage years, I found that so-called \"*Haya'a*\" to be restrictive in what I do and my learning process in life.\n\nThis had me develop habits where I speak out of line, but I've now more or less stabilized said habits. Although I'm trying to know if my application is flawed or even my own reasoning is flawed."

I like to write poems and stories, the only problem here is the element known as fiction. Differences of opinion come up but overall the idea is that It's ***Halal***(Permissible) as long as the details of the said story don't contradict Islam's doctrines or the very conservative opinion of:\n\n\"*It's fiction, lying straight to people's faces. It's also a waste of time. It's, therefore,* ***Haram***(Forbidden).\"\n\nAnd with how our religion believes in concepts of prevention not so much as cures, the notion of risk is very looked down upon. Especially with the apparent yet understandable disdain toward gambling, dice, and other events where \"*luck*\" is involved. Islam despises \"*luck*\" or the notion of \"*risking*\" rather explicitly so.\n\nThus making me feel almost obliged to throw that \"*talent*\" for writing away. Just like the many talents I've thrown away for the sake of Allah like drawing characters and music. Each one leaves me more frustrated than the last. You could tell me to write \"*non-fiction*\" but I have, and that isn't really \"*creative work*\".\n\nYou don't need to remind me of the notion that whoever leaves something bad for the sake of Allah, Allah will reward him with something better than it. And personally, that isn't particularly motivating. But I'm doing it because it's for the best not for any reward, really.\n\nNow I'm even contemplating throwing away playing games in general, and once I do. I won't have much left, really. I'll resort to sports and studying, and living life as grey as possible.\n\nThis leaves me in a state of \"*dissonance*\", where I feel like I have a few empty spots in my heart/soul. Now some might say: \"*Great! Fill those wholes with the remembrance of Allah.*\"\n\nI have tried, but they aren't particularly being filled. I do a lot of ***Dhikr***(remembrance) passively, be it thinking of how everything relates to Allah, marveling at his creations, praising his perfection; or simply reciting Qur'an.\n\nNonetheless, it's frustrating really, how I have to abandon all these hours.\n\nSome people might say: \"*That's just how life is though, it's full of trials and tribulations. You'll feel truly satisfied in Paradise. Just be patient.*\"\n\nTo that, I find disdain in my heart personally speaking. How I have to \"*die*\" before I can feel satisfied with my life, and that, I can't stand it.\n\nSome of you might say I have the wrong priorities and that I should focus on the Akhira, but I want a balance. I want a good life in the Dunya and a good end in the Akhira. Call me greedy if you'd like but it isn't impossible. Some might respond that I should just change my perspectives and just accept it all as is.\n\nI don't have many desires as a whole as a person, not many at all. I don't think I particularly \"*desire*\" Paradise. I just don't want to be in Hellfire really. Paradise never felt like a reward, I don't feel like I deserve it and never will.\n\nEither way, I just feel a bit empty right about now, that is all. I'd like to hear your thoughts."

                "body": "AssalumuAlaykum,\n\nAs the title states, the more I understand on the rights, duties, and responsibilities associated with marriage the more I dislike the idea of going through with it.\n\nI'm not saying that I dislike what is halal in the sense that I despise marriage/find it to be unnecessary. Far from that. That isn't what I'm saying at all.\n\nIt's more of a personal idea when it comes to how I would behave as a Husband. Personally, I'm not a person who commands nor do I like to give commands. The concept of an \"*obeying*\" wife doesn't particularly entertain me. It's more of a \"*fact of life*\" kind of reaction. If I were to get married I'd personally do everything myself. I'd clean, I'd cook, I'd work, I'd engage in my hobbies. I always had the belief: \"*Why would I ask someone to do it when I can do it myself? I* ***am*** *currently free to do so.*\"\n\nThe second point would be intimacy, for the sake of my wife, I would probably never be the one to initiate intimacy unless she does. The reasons for that are to shut down all the possibilities of Angels cursing her. So if ***I*** never call her to do so, then that event cannot happen. Now some might reply that it's almost impossible to do so, but it isn't. I've gone 6 years without it, and I can shut down my desires with the correct redistribution of blood flow. If I simply do cardio when in a state of desire then I can shut it down. This is what I've always done during those 6 years. My desires are also not even that strong. Strong in the sense that they override reason.\n\nBut this has me contemplating another concept, am I doing this out of rebellion? Where I'm rejecting the rights Allah (SWT) has bestowed upon me? If so, is this Kufr? I don't know. Basically, looking at it from a mechanical perspective, what I'm doing is trying to tweak parts of the religion to approach the relationship dynamic I desire. And that makes me question if I even have the right to do so.\n\nThe final point is children, children to me are a ***huge*** responsibility. It isn't a joke, and personally, I won't take the sit-back-and-watch approach. I can't do that. These children need to be nurtured, I can't bring myself to do that. And that behavior is definitely going to be stressful.\n\nThoughts?"

                "body": "AssalamuAlaykum,\n\nIn this post, I've been thinking and meaning to ask about particular concepts. This time it's about risk. Particularly associated with how we, as Muslims, never interact with anything that even has a possibility of being 1% problematic. Which, as pedantic as that is, does indeed make sense. Although I do need some clarification. \n\nNonetheless, though, the concept of Tawakkul still exists for a reason. And that's where I come to ask to understand the borderline of when Tawakkul should be practiced.\n\nI have multiple cases and I'd like to understand when it comes to the idea of risk. \n\n***Case 1: Injury.***\n\n   Let's assume there is a Muslim who has pursued becoming an athlete, they've been training ever since childhood and are planning on taking this into a career-based fashion. They maintain their obligations and awrah and focus on succeeding in the match specifically. Sooner or later, during practice, they end up injured by tearing a tendon in their knee, which thankfully (AlhamduliLah) had healed. But now there retains the risk of:  \n\"*If your knee tears once more you won't be able to play again.*\"  \nUnder such a case, are they allowed to continue playing in spite of that risk? They're indeed healed in the sense they're capable of playing and running as normal, simply that if it ***does*** tear again, permanent damage will most likely be caused.\n\nI ask of this particularly pertaining to the idea of living one's life. We, as humans only live once in this Dunya (Worldly Life) and while granted it isn't as important as our Afterlife (Akhira) we are to enjoy our time here when we can and thank Allah in our duties of worship until our time is up. There is a reason to congratulate and pray to Allah for blessings to those with long lives. So, in my personal case, I ask. Is it wrong for one to push passed in spite of their current circumstances?\n\n   I'm personally not an athlete, yet a similar case might come up. Where I have a choice to risk something or to live it as safely as possible. I'm personally discouraged by the latter, as that just makes people more restricted. They won't play any. sports, won't run too much,  or even regular exercise all for the sake of \"*safety.*\" I'd imagine there is a balance involved, but personally speaking, I would risk it anyway. But in case it's a problematic decision to take, I came here to ask.\n\n***Case 2: Travel.***\n\nSome people hold the opinion of: \"*It is Haraam to leave one's Muslim homeland for a Kafir country as the risk of Fitnah is too high.*\" While that argument is indeed valid, it simply insinuates that I am to not travel the world for the sake of learning more due to the risk of Fitnah existing.   \nIf that is indeed true, as in I'm not allowed to settle or even temporarily visit a non-Muslim-majority country for the sole risk of Fitnah, then shouldn't that logic apply to concepts such as the Internet? Where the internet would be considered \"*Haraam*\" due to the possible risks of losing one's faith. Due to the extreme amount of Fitnah. My understanding is that such things are like a cup, where the usage of a cup is indeed allowed, what the cup is used to ***drink*** is what makes it Haram or Halal. \n\nThoughts?"

For example, marriage.\n\n>*Narrated Anas bin Malik: A group of three men came to the houses of the wives of the Prophet (\ufdfa) asking how the Prophet (\ufdfa) worshipped (Allah), and when they were informed about that, they considered their worship insufficient and said, \"Where are we from the Prophet (\ufdfa) as his past and future sins have been forgiven.\" Then one of them said, \"I will offer the prayer throughout the night forever.\" The other said, \"I will fast throughout the year and will not break my fast.\" The third said, \"I will keep away from the women and will not marry forever.\" Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) came to them and said, \"Are you the same people who said so-and-so? By Allah, I am more submissive to Allah and more afraid of Him than you; yet I fast and break my fast, I do sleep and I also marry women. So he who does not follow my tradition in religion, is not from me (not one of my followers).*  \n>  \n>Sahih al-Bukhari 5063\n\nIt's basically implying here: \"*If you do not follow my Sunnah, then you're not among my followers.*\" This further implies: \"*You've made your own sect other than what the Messenger(PBUH) of Allah(SWT) has ordained.*\"\n\nAnd recall the other Hadith:\n\n>*It was narrated from \u2018Awf bin Malik that the Messenger of Allah(\ufdfa) said: \u201cThe Jews split into seventy-one sects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy in Hell. The Christians split into seventy-two sects, seventy-one of which will be in Hell and one in Paradise. I swear by the One Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, my nation will split into seventy-three sects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy-two in Hell.\u201d It was said: \u201cO Messenger of Allah, who are they?\u201d He said: \u201cThe main body.\u201d*  \n>  \n>Grade: ***Hasan (Darussalam)***  \n>  \n>Sunan Ibn Majah 3992\n\nWhich then further heavily implies that you'll have an extremely high chance of being chained to Hellfire if you make another sect. Meaning, if you reject marriage and made it something \"*traditional*\" then you've caused another sect, which has an absurdly high chance of it falling into ruin(hellfire).\n\nWhile I know this isn't so black-and-white/extreme, it can definitely feel that way by how Islamic teachers have taught me in school through similar implicit arguments and inductive reasoning.\n\nWhen it comes to that I just end up asking then: \"*Why not just explicitly say that:* ***If one is capable of marriage, then they must get married.***\"\n\nIt just feels out of touch, so to speak."

It's been very hard, but I've only received praise from my boss and coworkers on how well I've done, and some say that they would be actually lost without me. \n\nDuring all of this, I've fluctuated between feeling like I'm doing a really good job and feeling like I'm just not good enough no matter what I do. I try to remind myself that I try to do my best and I can't magically be more than that, but I still find myself nit-picking everything I do. I think I'm by far my harshest critic and that has just gotten worse over the years. \n\nIt was at its absolute worst yesterday after I ran multiple interviews. I worried that they didn't like me and I scared them away. I did my research to prepare and try and give a good, comfortable interview experience for us and the candidates. Part of me thinks the interviews went really well, but I also feel like I'm a naturally terrible interviewer. I can't tell if that's just me or if it's true. I have barely any reference for what a good interview should be like, and I already know how harsh I am on myself too. \n\nTLDR: My confidence in my ability to do my job well goes from high to low all the time, lately getting lower, even though my boss and coworkers only tell me I'm doing really well. Do you guys ever feel this kind of back and forth in your self-confidence, especially when it comes to something like being a good interviewer? Is that a common feeling to have as a relatively new HR professional? How do you deal with it?"

                "body": "tldr, do you work less so you can pay your ex less in spousal support post divorce?\n\nBackstory time!\n\nWhen I was married, I was the sole breadwinner of the household for all but about three of the 17 years I was with my ex.  We had no children and were SINKS or DINKS (single/double income no kids) and had built an small retirement portfolio and a fancy house and didn't really want for anything, even though my ex went to school full time for 13 of those years.  We pulled it off because I'm pretty shrewd and at the time, I was really really into working.  60 hour weeks most weeks and 100 sometimes.  A month after my ex got employed after her last credential, she kicked me out and I had to face down her infidelity and our marriage was over.\n\nWe had a comfortable life.  But, to save a lot of detail, I don't want to really disclose, the divorce made it impossible for me to continue  that old life and I had to completely start over.  I mean, start over.  My divorce was so contentious (I have a similar name as my father, and had my own related business, plus did work for my parents company) it strained my relationship with my parents so bad they sold out and I haven't spoken with them in many years.  My family had been very close and I usually had Thanksgiving at my home for 40+ people.\n\nBut my life is different now post divorce - most importantly, a new business that has zero assets and it's all my labor where I have a small bespoke clientele and I stop taking customers when I get to a certain $ threshold.  That threshold is set by my ex, who has a job where her salary is publicly discoverable.  I refuse to make a penny over that because making less than her is an affirmative defense in family court against spousal support.\n\nMy divorce consumed my half of my accumulated equity (in legal fees to get rid of my ex who was representing herself per se and creating a lot of havoc)  and she got hers - which she deserved.  I'm totally okay with that.  But in my state she has lifetime recourse to come back for support because of the length of time we were married.  That causes me no small amount of anxiety.  So nowadays, I usually work a short three days a week and take it easy the rest of the time.  Enjoying my really wonderful life I've created.  But -frankly - a little bored because I really enjoyed it when I had 600 employees and a company that did $150M in revenue a year to look after.  \n\nAnd I didn't mind my ex being in my wallet when we were married, but man did my opinion of her change in the three years it took to divorce her.  Somehow she expected me to continue to work like a dog and front a lifestyle for her - and me not be a part of it.  Yeah, no.  I mean, no.  You can figure it out yourself with your wallet.  You can't have mine anymore.\n\nSo, I know I'm not the only one who has this problem because I know lots of WOMEN who had to pay spousal support to the husband post divorce.   Except I got around it by making less and lowering my lifestyle.  So this isn't a sexist thing.  It's an spousal support thing.\n\nAnd that's my question?  Am I the only one who does this?  Or did you make compromises that maximize your potential (it doesn't just have to be income, you could do it for visitation or any host of other reasons) did you take on as a result of your divorce?\n\nThanks for your time."

Someone who has enough brains to 1) read and 2) care what you have to say.  So, kindly keep that in mind while you read on.\n\nIn another thread, I commented that I would insta swipe left on a womans bio if she wrote certain things because they implied frustration and a bad attitude.  Here are a smattering of pretty typical posts that I swiped left on just today.\n\n>Seems as though I need to put it bluntly that if your hitting me up for booty calls don't bother; I'm not a prude but lately this is what I've been attracting on here.  \n>  \n>I'm a workaholic and I......\n\nGot it.  No booty calls, but not a prude.  Works big hours.  You'll have to be flexable with your life because she can't be with hers.\n\n>I will not give you money.  Please don't try my patience.  It will not end well for you.\n\nI'm sincerely curious what she would do if I asked for money.  Is she threatening to kick my butt?  Not that I would ask anyone for money.  I have my own money. I digress.\n\n>So, I did meet a guy on here, but he turned out to be a game player and was a narcissist, so no narcissists please!\n\nThis is probably my favorite one, as this lady is advertising that she's already prime to be manipulated by a narcissist because she's already fallen prey to one.  All they have to do is run the standard narc game on her and she'll fall for it again.\n\nBut here's the kicker:\n\n>Fun loving, easy going woman looking for the real thing.\n\nOh wait, I swiped right on her.  Anyone wonder why?\n\nWhy I'm writing this:  I'm focused on having fun, living my best life, and finding like minded women who want to do the same.  I was not always like this.  I was married for 20 years, but went through a scorching divorce, and had enough trust issues to fill a warehouse as recently as six months ago - and gave up ever dating again.\n\nThen I fixed my attitude.  Because you can't catch bees with vinegar, you need pollen.  Your first sentence can do the same.  Or it can alienate good men who otherwise might swipe right.  Your choice.\n\nY'all be safe out there."

At first I thought if I went with them I could maybe explain how the waves worked and help them have some awareness in the water, but dang it the chaos was too hard for me to control. They formed a pack and essentially turned into a bunch of floating mines last summer, and anytime I went with them I\u2019d have to leave my board on the beach and frantically keep them from colliding with other surfers. They\u2019ve been too cold to go out ever since summer ended, but spring is just around the corner and they\u2019ll probably back out there. Its been so peaceful surfing without them and I don\u2019t want to surf with them anymore, but I really hate the thought of them causing problems for other people.",

This inflammatory response causes fatigue in a similar way that influenza causes fatigue: your body is producing inflammatory cytokines which are telling your immune system to fight something. The stress of the immune response can lead to fatigue.\n\nPoor sleep quality is another component of AS that can lead to fatigue. Stiffness and pain while sleeping causes you to wake up, which decreases the amount of quality REM sleep you get. \n\nArthritis.org has some other explanations on why inflammatory arthritis can lead to fatigue:\n\nhttps://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/managing-pain/fatigue-sleep/causes-of-fatigue-in-arthritis",

My job also gives me really good insurance, which is helping keep me well enough to do the things I want to do. \n\nI worked when I was at my worst, so I don\u2019t really feel like leaving work now that I\u2019m doing better. I also work in an academic research lab, so my days are usually pretty varied. I can stretch while waiting for experiments to finish, I can sit down if I need, and I\u2019m not sitting at a desk all day which makes things a million times worse for me. \n\nKeeping an active lifestyle has helped me a lot, and I think it\u2019s what kept me from turning into the tin man while I was on the hunt for the right biologic for me. Setting an appropriate sleep schedules and sticking to those boundaries has also helped a lot. \n\nSchool was tough because I\u2019d get super stiff and my joints would be really painful after sitting in lecture, so I\u2019d end up sitting in back and pacing if it got too bad. \n\nAgain, everyone is different. My uncle was a truck driver and a construction worker, and ended up going on disability when he was diagnosed. Since he can\u2019t turn his head due to neck fusion and sitting for long periods of time make his symptoms worse, he made the decision not to work anymore and it\u2019s really helped him. He\u2019s able to go for walks, get outside, and he\u2019s had a much easier time managing his AS since quitting harsh manual labor jobs and going on disability. \n\nIt all comes down to you need to do what\u2019s right for you. What works for me doesn\u2019t work for everyone, but I do think gentle exercise and movement is crucial to managing symptoms. Jobs that can be more flexible and can allow you to be active in some way tend to be better than desk jobs or hard manual labor.",

Select all the images in the folder through the renaming software (Desktop>[whatever you named your folder]), by selecting one and pressing \u201cCtrl + A\u201d and click the big \u201cRename\u201d button in the bottom right corner.\n\n6. Now go into Steam>Library>JPP7>Properties> games>JackboxTalks>content>JackboxTalksPictures\n\nHere you will find all the default images for Talking Points, and I recommend saving them to a different folder if you want to reset it at some point. \n\n7. Once you have moved the original images out of the folder, you can move the new images in, and should be able to play!\n\n\n\nNotes: \n\n3:2 ratio for images make it look more professional \n\nThese instructions may not be descriptive enough, so DM me if you want a better explanation \n\nI haven\u2019t made a guide like this before, so give me feedback if you would like\n\nPC only, I\u2019m afraid \n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\nEdit: The images will not appear on Jackbox.tv. You will be picking basically at random"

I ran without spikes but i dont think it made that much of a difference.\n\nAnd while track season starts again in 3 months I'm looking into dropping my time to hopefully a 11.7-12.5 seconds in a year (or more but hopefully not longer than two years or three years)\n\nthe problem is i don't have a training plan (I read the FAQ but it confuses me) and i dont know how I can improve my time. \n\nDo any of you guys have any tips or recommendations on what i should start doing and like any pointers on what to do in the future? \n\nI was thinking I should start just correcting my form first to prevent future injuries but I'm not sure\n\nThank you in advance!"

The outer ring of symbols with each of them having 6 broken or continuous lines are the 64 hexagrams.\n\nI have no idea what the symbols made up of 28 symbols are supposed to mean. Perhaps referring to the [28 constellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-Eight_Mansions)? I believe they are also used in some sort of divination.\n\nCloser to the center, the 8 symbols made of 3 broken or continuous lines are the [Bagua](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%AB%E5%8D%A6). Two from these 8 combined together, with one on top and the other on the bottom, form the 64 hexagrams in the outer ring.\n\nThe center thing with 5 circles interconnected probably refers to the [wuxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxing_(Chinese_philosophy)), or the Chinese 5 elements, similar to the Greek 4 elements. The 5 elements overcome and generate each other at the same time, hence the interconnected lines, with the inner connections representing overcome relationships and the outer connections representing generating relationships.\n\nOverall this is just a collection of Chinese occult/divination symbols.",

For example in Hexagon 1, it predicts that if you take the initiative and endeavor to do something, you will succeed -- provided that you prepare well first, seek help from the powerful, be proactive in identifying and fixing issues and be adaptable in your plans. Is it that remarkable of a prediction that someone's plans succeed if they could do all that? This reminds me of local paper's horoscopes: Scorpios, you will find it rewarding today to spend some time with your family! Wow, what an astounding revelation, thanks newspaper.\n\nI for one, do not believe that the relative positions of stars has anything to do with destiny, or that burning herbs and drilling holes on turtle shells for I'ching divination could reveal the future. But I'ching is still a fascinating read because of the philosophy of constant change it conveys. Declines inevitably follow peaks and there will eventually be ways out of the hardest of times. \n\nThe hexagrams of I'ching often describe little generalized scenarios, how they progress and the appropriate course of action in each stage. In my post above, the scenario of hexagram 2 is about letting things develop naturally. Other scenarios might include taking the initiative (hexagram 1), struggling through the beginning stage (hexagram 3), suffering from excessiveness (hexagrams 28, 62) or lack of resources (hexagrams 5, 9). In a sense they're like little storyboards which is why my mind immediately jumped to potential parallels to TRG plot.",

                "body": "Hexagram 2 (\u5764\u5366) is still a fantastic omen, but it is a different type of good omen like hexagram 1 (\u4e7e\u5366). Whereas Hexagram 1 says there will be good fortune if one takes the initiative, embarks on an ambitious project and does something grand for all to see, hexagram 2 says good fortune comes from not taking the initiative (\u5148\u8ff7\u540e\u5f97\u4e3b), from letting things run its course naturally or even just maintaining the status quo (\u5b89\u8d1e\u5409).\n\nLine 1 (\u521d\u516d\uff1a\u5c65\u971c\uff0c\u575a\u51b0\u81f3) the line the JKR tweet was referring to, sort of explains why this is. Very literally, this says \"if you step on frost, solid ice will follow\". The book then explains this in more detail saying everything will progress on the track that it follows, and it takes time for things to go far, either in a good direction or a bad direction. It is therefore important to tell from an early stage which direction things are headed towards.\n\nLine 2 (\u516d\u4e8c\uff1a\u76f4\u65b9\u5927\uff0c\u65e0\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u4e0d\u5229) is more straightforward. \"Have integrity, authenticity and generosity, then things won't go badly even with no effort.\" The imagery of hexagram 2 is that of the Earth, and the ancient Chinese thought of the Earth as straight/authentic, square/honorable and large/generous. So this line basically says follow the virtues of the Earth and you'll be fine.\n\nLine 3 (\u516d\u4e09\uff1a\u542b\u7ae0\u53ef\u8d1e\uff0c\u6216\u4ece\u738b\u4e8b\uff0c\u65e0\u6210\u6709\u7ec8) says if you have talent but are also modest, maybe try enter into the King's service. Even if you don't achieve anything you will still turn out fine. This line is slightly more cautionary, as it describes someone talented but subordinate to someone else in power (the King). Be modest, don't try to overachieve and you'll turn out fine -- the implication being too ambitious in a weak position might draw persecution from someone in power.\n\nLine 4 (\u516d\u56db\uff1a\u62ec\u56ca\uff0c\u65e0\u548e\u65e0\u8a89) is similar to line 3. Both lines refer to someone in a rather precarious position near the middle of a hierarchy. The person in line 4 is now higher up, and their work and life are more visible. The advice given by line 4 to this person it to \"tie up the bag and receive neither criticism nor commendations\". Again, be modest and lay low.\n\nLine 5 (\u516d\u4e94\uff1a\u9ec4\u88f3\uff0c\u5143\u5409) says \"wear yellow pants and you will have good fortunes\". This seems nonsensical, but it is a metaphor for someone in a position of power (as line 5s generally refer to) adopting a slower, more tactful approach, and putting themselves in a lower position in service of others. The book believes this will lead to good fortunes.\n\nLine 6 (\u4e0a\u516d\uff1a\u9f99\u6218\u4e8e\u91ce\uff0c\u5176\u8840\u7384\u9ec4) is again cautionary. The line says \"a dragon battles in the fields and its blood is yellow\". When someone let success get to their heads, and they abandon the slower, grounded approach that got them that success in favor of aggressive and drastic measures, this will lead to conflicts.\n\nSo the whole hexagram creates a narrative of letting things be and waiting for good things to happen -- if you're honest, generous, tolerant and modest.\n\n**Implications for the novel**\n\nSo what connections can we make from all this Iching stuff to the novel?\n\nWell \"Running Grave\" and the reference to line 1 (step on frost, solid ice follows) seems to suggest someone's chicken has come home to roost after being horrible towards someone. If we follow the examples set in the more detailed description for line 1, perhaps we are looking at a murder of someone in position of power by a subordinate, or even a father murdered by his son.\n\nOr perhaps some of this might also refer to the Robin/Strike romance? Perhaps we'll see it develop healthily without any drama? Or maybe they're taking a step back and find it beneficial? Are we in for another slow burn?",

To the south, the Alliance has reestablished Fort Triumph and from there, launched attacks to Desolation Hold and laid siege to the gates of Mulgore. To the north, the Alliance was also attacking the Crossroads (and perhaps captured it).\n\nBut even more shocking is the extent of the action close to Orgrimmar. In Durotar, the Alliance was raiding Echo Isles and attacked Razor Hill. To the north, Alliance was attacking Bilgewater Harbor. There was also a mention that the vengeful Night Elves were recalling their forces from all over Kalimdor to prepare for a direct assault on Orgrimmar.\n\nThe Alliance had marched to the gates of Mulgore and had brought the war dangerously close to Orgrimmar, threatening a direct assault. If you were like me, you might have wondered how an Alliance army just magically appeared outside Orgrimmar in 8.3, but the military action in Azshara, the Barrens and Durotar was already laid out in these missions. \n\nContrast the precarious states of the Horde capitals to the cities of Stormwind and Ironforge, which were never threatened directly. All actions in EK happened in the north, where it was implied that the Alliance had captured Tirisfal Glades and was defending it against Horde reinforcements from Silverpine. Horde positions in Hillsbrad were also surrounded, with missions describing Alliance armies marching from Gilneas, Plaguelands and Arathi Highlands, and Alliance activities in Southshore (reclaimed) and along the Darrowmere river.\n\nIn the BoD aftermath, both factions mentioned that the Alliance was tightening its grip and close to victory, but the follower missions really tell the story. Now after seeing these, I really wish Blizzard could elaborate more on the war that was happening in Kalimdor and EK, maybe in some other material."

The Soviets surely couldn't have reasonably anticipated that protesting PRC's exclusion would result in any concrete changes to that front in the short term.\n2. A veto on the resolution might not have stopped US military intervention from eventually happening, but it would've been a diplomatic setback, and might have delayed the intervention, buying time for KPA.\n3. Stalin gave the go-ahead to Kim Il-sung and was thus fully aware of the coming war in Korea. Without his approval, the war wouldn't have happened. It's hard to argue that he miscalculated, that he wanted to veto the resolution but couldn't.\n4. USSR returned to UNSC on August 1 anyway. If they had really wanted to veto, surely they could've returned \\~1 month early?\n\n**These oddities made me wonder if USSR actually wanted to encourage American intervention in Korea.** This [telegraph](https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/112225) from Stalin to Klement Gottwald also suggests that this whole boycott was deliberate -- granted that Stalin would've wanted to act like this was all part of his plan even if it really wasn't.\n\nAnd if so, **did USSR also want to draw China into the war?** If USSR wanted to escalate the war and involve foreign parties, then it didn't make sense to draw them in for one side but not the other. And if USSR didn't want to be involved directly, then it follows that China was the one USSR wanted in the war.\n\nAnd finally, **what would've been USSR's intended aim in doing so?**"

                "created_utc": 1607123175.0,
                "body": "I've seen some arguments in this sub along the lines of \"when players get more Versatility down the line, the meta will be less one-shotty than it is now\".\n\nBut will it though?\n\nThis is actually kind of a fallacy, because barring past gimmicks (Conflict and Strife), more secondary stats in general will increase the pace of the game, even if all of that increase comes in the form of Versatility, as I will show below. In fact, this is exacerbated by the PvP set bonus now in SL.\n\nIf the increase in Versatility comes at the cost of other secondary stats, and the total budget remains roughly the same, then yes the game will slow down. But this isn't the case here. As people's ilvl increase, their total amount of secondary stats will also increase.\n\n**Versatility Still Increases Pace of the Game**\n\nConsider this scenario. Player A, who would do y amount of burst DPS at 0% Vers is trying to burst down player B. Player B's healer is stuck in cc, and he himself is stunned -- a very typical go set-up.\n\nFor fairness and simplicity's sake, let's say player A and B have the same amount of versatility, v. Player A's damage after factoring versatility is y(1+v), but when it is applied to player B, it is reduced by 0.5v. So player A's effective DPS to B is y(1+v)(1-0.5v).\n\nCompare that to 0% vers, player A's effective DPS to B is therefore (1+v)(1-0.5v) times that of the original.\n\nIf we factor in the new 2 piece PvP set bonus, that multiplier is now (1+1.4v)(1-0.5v).\n\nLet's plot this from v = 0% to 50%.\n\n[Effective DPS multiplier vs. Versatility, SL with and without PvP set bonus](https://preview.redd.it/2sfde0kev8361.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2c66338a16795f37b5d8252dca30cd55616a3d38)\n\nSo all else being equal, if both players' Versatility increases, the offensive player's effective DPS on the defending player still increases with Versatility, which means the go will be even more lethal.\n\nYou'll notice that once Versatility gets incredibly high, the effective DPS does reach a plateau. In fact, if you extend this graph to the right, you will see that the effective DPS will start to drop, which makes perfect sense in the algebra. But, in a day and age of low ilvls, secondary stat DR and no stat amps, it is highly unlikely that people will reach the 50%+ Versatility required for the plateauing to happen.\n\n**What was different in 8.3?**\n\nSo how did Vers stacking in 8.3 slow the game down to a high dampening meta?\n\nThe answer is Conflict and Strife. \n\nBefore the nerf, Conflict and Strife would increase the defensive benefit of Vers from 0.5v to v in a stun. After the nerf, it would increase the defensive benefit to 0.75v.\n\nConsider the exact scenario from above, but with Conflict and Strife active. The effective DPS multiplier is now (1+v)(1-v) and (1+v)(1-0.75v), pre and post nerf respectively. Of course, 8.3 had weird ass PvP scaling etc. so it was a lot more nuanced than this, but the general idea was the same.\n\nWhen we plot this, the change is astounding:\n\n[Effective DPS multiplier with C&S vs. Versatility, pre and post nerf](https://preview.redd.it/mq8krie3z8361.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4385f02ef615d5a258fda0542726bad30058c5d4)\n\nContrary to what we are seeing in SL, more Vers across the board actually decreased the effective DPS done in a stun go. The more Vers everyone had, the less lethal stun go's became. The difference is gigantic between with and without C&S, especially for the high Vers numbers, which was very much the case when people routinely hit 40%+ Versa with stat amps.\n\nLet's say both A and B have 45% Vers. If B didn't have Conflict and Strife, A's effective DPS on him would've been 12.37% higher than the 0 Vers baseline. But if B had pre-nerf Conflict and Strife, A's effective DPS is now only 79.75% of the 0 Vers baseline. The stun go just became almost 30% less effective.\n\n**So What Does This Mean Going Forward?**\n\nSo the million dollar question right now is: will the meta become less bursty by itself as the season progresses when people get better gear, unlock more soulbinds etc.?\n\nWell, this analysis doesn't answer this question.\n\nThis analysis shows that one consequence of the season progressing, i.e. more secondary stat in general, will NOT slow the meta down, even if all of that comes in the form of Versatility. \n\nIt is not out of the question that other secondary stats might be coming to favor as the season progresses. Those bursty classes might decide that they didn't really need the defensive aspect of Versa, if they could just instagib people with more burst. So things like Mastery might become meta for some classes. This will accelerate the meta even more than Vers, as most DPS Masteries are more efficient at improving damage throughput and do not provide defensive benefits.\n\nAlso potentially contributing is the new secondary stat DR that they introduced, although it doesn't seem like a big factor in season 1.\n\nBut, more secondary stat is only one consequence of season progression.\n\nStamina and primary stats are also very important factors to consider. If stamina grows at a notably faster pace than primary stats with better gear, then this would drive to slow the meta down. Someone more educated on this topic should enlighten us.\n\nFinally, the effects of defensive soulbind slots and stamina boosts from renown might be another factor. But this is by nature a lot more nuanced and hard to predict."

I think it would be more realistic and appealing if cities maintain industrial or even medieval overlays and only start erecting skyscrapers after at least 10 pop.\n\nMy thoughts would be something like:\n\n\nIndustrial Era\n\nPop 1-7: classical/medieval/renaissance (cmr) city\n\nPop 8+: industrial city\n\n\nModern Era\n\nPop 1-4: cmr city\n\nPop 5-9: industrial city\n\nPop 10+: modern city\n\n\nFuture Era\n\nPop 1-3: cmr city\n\nPop 4-6: industrial city\n\nPop 7-9: modern city\n\nPop 10+: futuristic city\n\n\nThoughts on this? I feel like it would more accurately reflect how settlements look in countries today. No one just erects 2-3 remote skyscrapers when settling new land\u2014infrastructure is gradual."

Harry is recruited by a very different Tom Riddle to help bring down Grindelwald\u2019s reign.\n\nAdmittedly I almost skipped over this fic as the summery didn\u2019t really do much for me, but with little else to read I decided to give it a go.  I\u2019m really glad that I\u2019d did.  \n\nOne of the major positives that stuck out to me was the creative use of magic.  It made the fight scenes unique and enjoyable, rather than something to be skipped over.  So many stories use recycled concepts these days that this was a lovely change from all the general whitewash on ffn. \n\nHonestly, there weren\u2019t a lot of negatives for me, apart from maybe the pacing.  It does tend to go from excitement to excitement with no break in between for a breather, but the story was just so dang enjoyable that I didn\u2019t even care. \n\n[Parallel Journey by InkVirus](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12807959/1/)",

I recovered from it many years ago; I no longer have body dysmorphia, don't associate being skinny with being beautiful, and I want to actively gain weight.\n\nHowever I still perceive the act of eating as it was something shameful, even tho I don't want to. I feel extremely uncomfortable when someone, specially from my family, watches me eating, and if they let out a comment like \"wow are you gonna eat ALL of that?\" I burst out crying uncontrollably. That's why I always eat alone, which has caused to distance me a lot from my parents. I always try to eat the minimum amount possible if someone is watching me, not because I fear getting fat, but because I feel that they're gonna judge me if they see me being a \"glutton\". Whenever I've tried to gain weight I had to eat secretly from my parents and yet I was afraid that they'd realize that there was food missing and discover that it was I who ate it. I must make clear that they have NEVER scorned me for eating, they actually want me to eat and become more healthy, but I can't stand the feelings of shame and any innocent comment from them affects me A LOT. When I'm with friends it's not that bad, but still. I also feel ashamed of being hungry, I have a group of friends with whom I feel comfortable enough to casually mention sometimes that I'm hungry, and one of them once said \"you're always hungry\". I wanted to die in that moment and I started to cry.\n\nThere's a scene in the film *Girl, interrupted* where one of the girls say \"Everyone likes to be alone when it comes out. I like to be alone when it goes in. To me, the cafeteria is like being with twenty girls all at once taking a dump\", and that's exactly how I feel when eating in public lmao. I also have misophonia (severe feelings of discomfort and anxiety when hearing certain disgusting sounds, especially eating/drinking sounds) and that makes it even more difficult for me to eat with other people.\n\nI've started to do exercise and I have to consume an hypercaloric diet to gain volume, but I don't know how I'm gonna do it since having to eat sneakily is torture, and the effort I have to make makes me tired of eating so I stop following the diet and go back to my usual eating habits very soon. Even as I write this I want to cry. Does anyone else feel this way? Is it possible to get over this mentality? What can I do?"

I felt very flattered whenever someone told me that I looked younger than I was, but ironically, it hurt me a lot when people said I was acting childish, even when I did it on purpose. I think I wanted to preserve my innocence but at the same time I wanted people to see me as a mature person; I remember a time when my father was talking about a 15-year-old girl he met that looked much older than her age because of her personality, and he told her \"you could be my daughter's big sister!\" and I started to cry because deep inside I also wanted him to see me as a wise and mature person.\n\nI've always associated that attitude with the depression I had at the time; I had a very happy childhood but things started to get worse when I entered adolescence so it's just normal not wanting to grow up. My mother used to tell me that when I was three years old I got panick attacks when I was forced to go to school while my baby brother stayed at home, so I had a kind of 'mental block' and started acting like a baby during months, until my preschool teacher managed to take me out of that state. Some time ago I started reading about the age regression coping mechanism; can those two experiences have something to do with it? Nowadays I'm not as 'childish' as I was before (I'm 22) but I find comfort and safety in those things that remind me of my childhood.\n\nHowever I just started to think about it from a different perspective, and I think that maybe I acted that way at 14 not only because of my depression but also because I wanted to be desired by men. I wasn't a very sociable kid so I spent hours and hours every day on the internet, I was into anime a lot and my first contact with p * rn was h * ntai. I watched a lot of l * licon lewd art, not because I was turned on by it, but because I was curious, and I found that a lot of men were attracted by innocence. Everytime someone said \"[generic l * li] looks so cute, I want to...\" it just increased my desire to look younger. I thought that if I had an innocent looking face and the body of a child I would attract men, in fact I am of average height but I wanted to be shorter to look younger and 'cuter'; hell, even nowadays I feel flattered when I'm told that I look like a teen, I feel that I'm more attractive that way, however, why would I want to attract someone that feels turned on by young girls? This may sound ridiculous but I think of internet celebrities like Belle Delphine, who acts like a little girl to attract weaboos, and I think maybe I did that but on a subconscious level? I don't know, I'm scared to talk about this because it sounds disturbing, but that's what I felt at that moment (by the way, I do not have an age regression kink and I find l * licon despicable nowadays).\n\nI just want to know if someone relates to this, especially those who experiment age regression. I was diagnosed with BPD earlier this year, is this a common BPD thing? Thank you in advance."

                "body": "Sorry for the long post, it's a long story but I'll try to summarize it:\nWe were good long-distance friends, he was very intelligent and nice so I started to feel attracted to him on June of last year and he liked me too; however, we had never met in person, so we decided not to start a relationship at that time. At first he said beautiful things to me and as time passed I fell deeper in love with him; however, few months ago I started noticing that he was acting more distant towards me, which caused me anxiety. The fear that he didn't love me anymore was so intense that I began to self-harm because of it.\n\nThe problem is: a month ago, in March, I decided to ask him directly if he still had feelings for me (until then I had been afraid to ask); he said that he had stopped feeling anything for me since January (and had been hesitant since October), but he had been too cowardly to talk about it with me and had tried to wait until everything dissolved over time. At that moment I felt devastated and humiliated, since all that time I had only thought about him and tried to get his attention; I got angry, insulted him and he kept apologising to me and saying \"I'm a shitty person, I'm useless\", etc. He also told me that despite everything he still appreciated me. The next day I decided that I didn't want to lose his friendship (that would've been too painful for me) so I told him that I wanted to spend a month without talking to him, but that after that I'd like us to continue being friends. He agreed and said that he did want to keep being my friend. Later, we unfollowed each other on social media.\n\nIt was a horrible month for me but I managed to resist the urge to talk to him. When the month was over, I texted him \"Hi, how are you?\", I told him I was feeling better and was no longer angry, hoping that he would be happy to talk with me again; however, his responses were simply \"I'm glad\" and \"Thank you.\" I asked him why he was giving me such short answers, and he said it was because he was worried about a friend of his and feeling bad. Still, that made me feel terrible and I ended up saying \"forget it, I shouldn't have said anything.\"\n\nThe other day I decided to follow him again on social media to see if he followed me back; he did, and that made me feel better because I thought everything would be back to normal. However, even though we follow each other he never interacts with me (with the rest of our friends he does), which makes me very sad and anxious. I also haven't texted him since last time.\n\nI'm depressed and desperate, even though I'm no longer romantically attracted to him he's still my FP and I still need his affection and validation; I don't understand why he said he still appreciated me and wanted to be my friend if he was going to ignore me like that afterwards. Our friends in common say that he probably does appreciate me, since one of the reasons he was afraid to talk about his feelings with me was that he was afraid of making me angry and losing my frienship; however I don't know if his opinion on me has changed over this month, I don't understand why is he suddenly acting so cold and distant.\n\nI've tried very hard to overcome the anxiety and the feeling of emptiness left by the heartbreak, and I believed that maintaining contact with him would make me feel less sad than if I stopped talking to him completely, but now I wonder if I should let him go definitively and forget about him. I can't get him out of my mind and my grades are being affected because of this. Would it be better for me to block and forget him? I'd greatly appreciate any advice, thank you so much for reading."

First love, first dream, first hate...\n.\nYou were my first romance. You were the first person i ever decided i would protect and die for. And so when you left it hurt. When you tried to ambush me and \"save\" me, it hurt. I don't know what to think.\n.\nI don't have a picture of you. And you don't have socials so i can't look in your eyes while writing this. But somewhere deep inside me even without looking at you I know there's still the capacity to love you. I still have the ability to love you. \n.\nI definitely still have the capacity to be scared for you. And worry about you. Because right now i know you're homeless and i want nothing more than to be home again for you. We were that for over half a decade. You called me crying once.\n.\nYou were a burden. Like you thought and said you were. You were. I talk about you in therapy. But I chose you. I chose you every time I saw your short name pop up on my phone. I enabled your codependency as you did mine. We fucked each other up.\n.\nBut you were a different kind of fucked up. And now I'm a whole other different seperate kind of fucked up. I couldn't help you then and I don't want to now. At least my sober brain doesn't. I don't want to fix. I just wanna be there.\n.\nI have a theory that every person is a perfect puzzle piece when they're born and as they age they get chipped and cracked until they look so different from how they started. But there are pieces for everyone that just fit together.\n.\nI wonder if there's an edge for the two of us that just fits. I wonder if this story isn't quite over. If you read this ever. Know I'm around. I don't wanna fix anything because I don't have that capability and you can't fix me either. But id love to be friends while we fix ourselves."

More and More  I feel like every time she's brought up in either a positive or negative way the main consensus on the sub seems to turn into a bunch of people just saying they don't like her.\n\nThat's fine, but my main issue with it is just that many of the issues people seem to have with her really see to me to just be the consequence of bad writing.\n\nThe fact that no matter how close to her you get via romance or other quests that she always acts the same in the main quests is irritating. and really seems to be the main issue. And that's also the issue with pretty much every character. Merula is simply the one hardest hit by this because the default personality where you haven't gotten close to her is the bitchy bully.\n\nI've seen people try to make up explanations and headcanons, like her having  BPD or similar things, but really that's just an attempt to rationalize away the fact that the writing is such a  mess for her.\n\nI've heard people claim that she was only made romanceable because people wanted it, and that does seem to line up.\n\nIn a way, I feel like it would have been kinder not to make her romanceable at all,  that way you could have fanfics and things where she does fall for the mc and that has an impact. Now fans of Merula are stuck with the fact that no matter how hard you try or how close you get to her, she will just revert to her worst form the moment you click a main quest.\n\nShe'd definitely my favorite option for romance in terms of the idea of it, but what we have now is essentially forcing your character to fall in love with someone they just can't help and will likely be forced to watch fall to the dark side and/or possibly die with the way the story is going."

But, I am Christian, and he is not. My personal issue is if we were to raise and family together. We had a conversation about it and we would be ok with raising a family as Christian. But then the next issue is my parents, and my very very close family friends who are also Christian. My boyfriend is not against or closed off to being Christian, and I do not feel the need to \"change\" him, as it is his own free will to choose to believe. But my parents are worried for my well being if he isn't or doesn't become Christian. People from my church (the close family friends) have been almost pushing me to break it off if he doesn't become Christian. But I know I can't do that. He's the first person that I have loved so so much, and seen a real future with, and hes the only person who doesn't make me feel less of who I am. I want to marry him, I don't know what to do about my parents, or about my family friends. I'm scared they will either abandon me or push me away. I don't know much of where to look for advice, so I came here, if you guys know somewhere else I can ask for better advice or have advice yourself, I'd love the help. \n\nTLDR: want to get married one day, don't know what to do because family and friends might leave if I do, as I am Christian and he is not."

Now, I can remain grounded with that flashback by imagining that I land on a self-imagined ground inside that void safely. Before I would be falling endlessly. I try to confront my negative emotions in my nightmares, and see what I would have done to feel powerful or to not feel powerless in the situation in my nightmare. Or I process my negative beliefs that manifest in my nightmares. Usually it makes them go away. My nightmares are no longer scary, but I wake up from resentment and hatred.

                "body": "I might be ignorant so if there is anything that I say which is wrong or doesn't make sense, call me out.\n\nThis is all theoretical btw. Not having M21 exams have the following disadvantages:\n\n1. It will likely disincentivize students to study their material as they will not be tested on it. This leads to them not being ready for university. Furthermore, it defeats the purpose of educational institutes i.e. to learn.\n2. The IB algorithm will likely give us students unfair grades. This is because many of us underperform during the 1st semester of our 2nd year because we are busy writing IAs and applying to universities. Consequently, some students who qualify for higher grades will get lower grades and vice versa.\n3. Due to unfair and inaccurate grading, universities will likely accept and reject candidates who didn't deserve it. Some candidates would have achieved much higher with exams than without exams but because of the IB algorithm, they might lose out on many good universities. The opposite would also likely take place.\n4. The value of the IB Diploma for M21 can potentially decrease.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, M21 exams can provide the following advantages:\n\n1. It can force students to work harder which will increase their work ethic can possibly prepare them even more for university.\n2. It can possibly differentiate between conscientious/persevering students and lazy students. This can increase the confidence of the hard-working students in the future and create an experience that lazy students can reflect upon. I realize that some students will have situations where it is unrealistic for them to get the grades they would have gotten without Covid-19. But exams will still motivate them to learn more and achieve more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that there are reasons why M21 exams shouldn't take place. However, we shouldn't try to get exams canceled because it will make us feel better. Your feelings shouldn't be based on achieving 45 points. We should strive to get the highest grade we can get while getting good sleep, exercising, and maintaining a healthy diet. I am sure if we all spent 30 mins exercising instead of using Reddit, spent 1 hour on more sleep instead of Tik Tok, we would feel better. I know this hard in practice but we should aim for the theoretical best we can think of.\n\nHaving no exams shouldn't be the goal. There are better alternatives such as further reduction of coursework, online exams to stay safe from covid-19, and possibly more. The quality of the online exams is dependant on IB. If they fail to deliver fair online exams, then it is their fault and it should not be used against us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease be kind to me if I have said something stupid.\n\nEdit: I had a nice discussion with my friend about this and his experience with online learning was the opposite of mine. His teachers sucked and my teachers were amazing. I argued that there are so many good resources online for every subject. I can self-learn with those resources and asking questions from Reddit and still get a high IB score. He raised a very good point on this that if we self-learn, what is the point of IB? Like that is not what the IB is about. Why are we paying schools so much for just learning by ourselves then? We should be paying schools much less. IB should make exams free this year.\n\nMy new conclusion is that exams should happen but IB should make the exams free and possibly give us money for each exam we take, and maybe give us some of the tuition we gave them. It is unrealistic but it is fair. Maybe the IB should make it mandatory for the schools to reduce tuition fees."

But depending on how my body feels I will call out sick often. Typically if I get really bad headaches, body aches, or fevers in the morning I will call out sick. This turns into a bit of a pattern throughout the months. I've gotten checked for anemia, thyroid issues, etc. but doctors say I seem fine. I've also been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a couple of years ago. I took some antidepressants for a year and then I felt okay enough where my depression and anxiety weren't debilitating so I stopped taking the meds. But I am consistently going through these patterns of being unable to work well because I'll get body aches every couple of months. Then I'll call out sick. I've had three different jobs (two of them were in the same department) for the last four years and I can't seem to work well in any of those jobs. I am kind of at a loss on what to do now. Any advice on where to start with these issues? I'd be extremely grateful!"

When I talked to my insurance agent he said that it doesn't cover for my passengers. I was confused because I thought bodily injury covered for my passengers as well as the other person in the other vehicle. The police report stated I was at fault but my insurance adjuster is stating that it might be shared responsibilities.\n\n1. Someone told me if the passengers in my car sued my insurance company for more than the 25k I would not only have to pay out of pocket, but also be uninsurable... is that true?\n2. Does my insurance cover my passengers? And if so, should I just have my passengers go through my insurance to recover the costs of chiro/pt/injection treatments?\n3. Should I try to pay them out of pocket instead? One of the passengers said her treatment would be over $1k...the other one is fine and she is just receiving standard chiro/pt for a bit just to make sure.\n\nSorry this is my first accident and need some advice.\n\nState: CO"

Ti strips down everything to its first principle to figure out how it works, Ne functions under Ti\u2019s influence and generates different ideas. but then it got me thinking, **what** ideas? im not entirely bland, but i don\u2019t find myself being much of a creative person. i have ideas yes, but i dont walk around blabbering stupid shit i know wont work. \n\nif anything, im more of a realist because according to Ne, its users are usually optimistic, they spit out new possibilities (even if they obviously wont work imo) and connect dots constantly. then i went to read more about ni and what it was a bunch of crap about zen experience, third eye stuff and i assumed that wasn\u2019t me. I thought to myself; im pretty sure im good at connecting the dots, i catch up with things quickly, and am always in my head about something entirely unrelated to whatever was happening in front of me. i loved theoretical concepts and i was always praised for the ways i looked at certain things. plus i wasn\u2019t very much of an organized person either so Ne would be the obvious choice, minus the optimism. i didnt relate to any of the sensory functions either.\n\ni have an ENFP friend; being an Ne dominant, she was slightly irresponsible and was slower than me whenever a problem presented itself. she was also disruptive, it pissed me off whenever she was obviously not listening, and a huge procrastinator (im also a procrastinator myself, but i know my limits; unlike her). one time we were doing an iq test, i told her to record herself while doing it because her rambling cancels out my concentration. i observed how she answered the questions, and i noticed that she stayed really short with her problems and switched from one question to another, abandoning it. i obviously couldn\u2019t relate, whenever i solve a problem; i tend to focus heavily on all possible angles and think **REALLY REALLY** long about them. i have this fear of lost potential or missing a point within each possibility, so i spend alot of time exploring each and every single one i could think of. \n\nat one point; i read about Ni again and something clicked in me. the more i thought about myself, the more i related to Ni traits. i often have random realizations, it also happens when my brain\u2019s fully relaxed after putting a problem down for some rest. i always know when something\u2019s a bad idea when i hear it, and im great at reading people. sometimes i feel like people don\u2019t truly understand the beauty of deep thinking, i think there\u2019s a difference between understanding a concept and **realizing** the concept and its meaning. despite all this though, i\u2019m still not much of a planner. i think ahead before i do things yes, but i don\u2019t plan trips or have any lists/schedules. im also a Ti user, i relate to both Ti and Ni (sometimes Ne when im happy).\n\n\nno, im not infj because i have 0 Fe in me. \n\n\nyes, im aware that i have a REAL function stack (a stack not according to mbti stacking) but i\u2019m obviously gonna have to make up my mind when someone asks me what my type is. \n\n**TLDR: i dont know if i use Ni OR Ti + Ne because they\u2019re similar.**"

His shitty, lumpy bastard head? The three thousand percent unnecessary dumbass shitass fucking SNOW BUCK TOOTH that no snowman has EVER FUCKING HAD IN tHE HISTORY OF GOD'S GREEN FUCKING EARTH? God, I hate him. I hate him so much. So FUCKING much. Every time I see a stuffed toy Olaf or an Olaf gif or a shitty goddamn commercial, it ignites my primal rage response and I'm overcome by the need to punt this shitty little homunculus into the fucking sun. \"Bhurr blur, I'm Olaf the fuckshit snow fucker, I like warm hugs\". Fuck you. Fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you. You look like Tow Mater summoned a patronus. Your dumb fucking twig hair makes your whole shitty head look like a hairy skin tag. I hate your dumb fucking lumpy carrot nose and your stupid, empty googly eyes and your over-the-top goofy ass upbeat asshole personality. Any scene he's sad it invokes all the wrath and fury of a spoiled child having a meltdown over a chocolate bar in a w*lmart checkout line. And I know its irrational. That's the worst part. I know he's just a shitty fucking side character in a stupid fucking children's movie, I know it doesn't matter, I know I shouldn't care. But that's part of the problem. The part where no matter the might and fury of my hatred, the locus of my homicidal intent is alltogether inconsequential. I find myself laying awake in the dark in the early hours of the morning consumed by the spirit of Wrath itself, all the force and might of a flaming hurricane directed at a bottle of piss in a ditch by the highway. The absurdity of it all burns me to my core. What better things could this energy be directed towards? And yet my disdain for this stupid, useless, insubstantial failure of endearing character design utterly eclipses the intrigue of all other pursuits. I hate him. I hate him on a level of my mind reserved for the worst of the world's array of sinners, and I can't even begin to justify it. Shitstick the snow dick is, for all intents and purposes, the animated corpse of all of humanity's saccharine pretenses- every condescending, passive-aggressive statement of meaningless upper middle class suburban drama distilled into a single, hateable form. The fucking. Fuck. I have no words. There is no cuss or epithet in any language that can encapsulate the height of the emotions I am experiencing. God, I hate him so much. I hate him so, so fucking much. I want to light his ugly little dumpster body on fire. I want to graphically beat him to death with his own stupid fucking nose. I want to punch him to death. You know that weird feeling you get, when you see a picture of something so cute you find yourself overcome with the bizarre, inexplicable urge to squeeze it? It's EXACTLY like that, except instead of cuteness it's disgust. The wordless knowledge that his existence as a fictional work is evidence of all the failures of mankind. I find myself possessed by the will of a Holy Angel gone rogue with the belief that God has made a mistake, and I alone must correct it. This is the trial by which Samael himself fell from grace. This wild, meaningless rage. A thousand blades of shining steel cast with inhuman force in the direction of a plastic grocery bag floating on a breeze. What horrors must I have committed in a past life to be plagued by this torment now? I must Unmake this fictional snowman"

Not because I actively chose to but just because I was lost in the numbness that I got from that place and just didn\u2019t really have anything to say (and damn I normally talk a lot). Buchenwald is placed on a windy hill near Weimar. It is always windy and cold on the main grounds and you can see on the city from there (you can also see the private little zoo that the nazi officers had, but only from the side where the animals can\u2019t be watched). They had the people stand outside for up to 18 hours in winter where some just collapsed onto the ground. It says \u201ejedem das seine\u201c (each to their own) on the door, the way that you can read it from the inside and the clock is still set on 15:15, the time when the camp was freed in 1945. \n\nIt was surely one of the worst and over all strangest days I\u2019ve ever had but I think it\u2019s so important that visiting a concentration camp is and stays mandatory for German students.\n\nEdit: small grammatical error",

There\u2019s no information about her parents but (judging by the name) she could be the daughter of Vinda Rosier - the woman living with Grindelwald in Paris. So could it be possible that Narcissa is the granddaughter of Grindelwald? That would explain her blonde hair (recessive Genes \u201eskip\u201c a generation a lot of times and then have a 50:50 chance of appearing which fits 1/3 daughters getting it, blonde hair is nearly always recessive) and fit into the timeline.

I am someone who enjoys public speaking,  extroverted, some people say aggressive and intimidating (this is not a  'ha ha brag I am a chad thing', please don't think it is), in fact my  crush said that he thought my best quality about me was my confidence so  that's lovely.\n\nBut,  regardless, I'm off track. So recently, I've been wondering, how do you  get signs from these sorts of people? He seems nice enough towards me,  but I think we're both quite distant from each other despite these  feelings going on inside me since the middle of 2020 (yes, you read that  right), and I've been simply being nice and biding my time. I've also  heard a little thing where he may be bi, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nSo, Reddit, please advise me. How do I break the enigma and figure out whether they like me or not?"

When I was younger I was worse at controlling my scratching and I actually have scars from scratching too hard. Luckily the itching doesn't flare up often, I'd say it occurs once every month. Still, it's a horrible sensation; the itch feels like it's deep under my skin, almost like bugs crawling around or digging into my tendons\n\nThe itching isn't accompanied by a rash, blisters, or dry skin. I have no known allergies. I suspect the itching is a reaction to something external, but I really have no idea what it could be. I'm unsure if this is at all related, but my hands are almost always freezing cold, and when I'm in cold temperatures for too long my hands fill with blood and feel like they're on fire, it's very painful. In contrast, the itching I'm talking about usually occurs when I'm indoors.\n\nAny ideas what might be going on? Cheers."

We shouldn\u2019t be stepping over the rights of the innocent frontline workers to get our message across. If our actions for equality jeopardize the safety and wellbeing of another group of people then we\u2019re not going about this the right way. And I know people said everyone will be careful and maintain a safe distance but how can you guarantee that? Just look at the protests in Toronto and how packed they were. Don\u2019t our frontline workers deserve the same support and consideration?\n\nIf we don\u2019t act carefully, there won\u2019t be a second wave in Ontario, it\u2019s going to be a tsunami and this movement will end up being blamed for it. It will hurt our cause in the future more than it will help. The province is not going to be able to handle the consequences of these protests. There are so many ways to achieve the systemic change that we seek but right now, a protest isn't one of them. I want change as much as any of you but we have to be reasonable about this if we want it to actually work and weed the injustice out from the root."

I don\u2019t tend to use Reddit as much as I used to and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s pretty unoptimal for a lot of the active people on here. I\u2019m happy with how I did when it was just me posting chapters and it\u2019s really satisfying to see how an actual community has grown and we\u2019ve gotten a decent amount of people hanging around and posting chapters.\n\nWith that being said, I\u2019m looking for a mod or two. I\u2019m looking for someone who is active on Reddit and this subreddit and is willing to sticky new chapters as they come out. Preferably this person would have been already posting chapters previously, and they have been a part of the Subreddit for a while. I\u2019m not interested in giving up my power as owner currently as I still want to look after this community but some help around would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks for reading, I\u2019ll see you guys later."

Gaming is quite hard for us, since  we are about 10k km apart and most online games have problems with our  internet speed - or her PC is not powerful enough. We played Stardew  Valley a lot, but thats pretty much all we were able to do, besides some  Asphalt and Plato on the phone. We do watch movies or anime, but doing  that on every call gets kind of boring and frustrating.\n\nWe  saw each other earlier this year when I visited her for a month. After  tasting how it could be if we were actually together, online substitutes  just don't work out as well anymore as before.\n\nI'd  be happy to hear about you and your experiences with this.

I feel like I'm one or two bad moments away to just call it quits.\n\nAnyways, a little context. I've been working for the last 6 months or so in a known multinational banking enterprise as a software developer. I was so happy about landing the job after just a few weeks of searching when I left my first job.\n\nMy first boss was very adamant that we should \"go back to the office\" and having 100% remote work for me was a dream come true. Also be able to talk to clients in English (not my mother language) and be able to test my abilities of being bilingual. And not to mention that I'm getting paid 25% more than on my previous job! What could possibly go wrong?\n\nFirst off, I underestimated the amount of tracking software my laptop comes with. It's against company policy to delete anything (even if it's helpful or even necessary for my job), everything is insanely bureaucratic, I have to change my status to \"Away\" when I go to the bathroom or get some coffee, and my laptop is running abnormally slow without a chance of me getting an upgrade because for every upgrade, they probably add something else to the tracking device.\n\nThe worst thing however is that I'm debugging seriously complicated code that's not documented, and the only remaining business analyst got a raise shortly before I got to work and has no time to teach me. My workmates were showing me the ropes but I'm getting to fix something they don't even know that well. Well, I should just ask them for help right?\n\nThe project is 2-3 years late and we're being pressured beyond belief to have bulky releases every few days, of a code I don't know that much. Even if I follow their advice and \"just ask for whatever help I need\", I know I'd just slow them down. But if I don't, I slow myself down.\n\nI recently got a notice from my workmates that my performance has been getting worse and that they're worried for my future on the company, and honestly I just want my way out: but considering the tracking software I'm not in the right mindset to job hunt as I can hear the chat notifications when on a job interview. Adding the pressure of me not wanting them to know I'm getting a new job.\n\nI'm seeing a neurologist this week because I've been having more severe anxiety attacks and right now I don't think I can keep working. But I can't shake the feeling that maybe it's just me; the imposter syndrome kicking in.\n\nI'm sorry if this post got too big but I hope I can get some feedback on how to manage stuff like this and if it's worth it or to just leave and stop sacrificing my wellbeing for a good paycheck."

For example:\n\n- **Room taxes:** If you run a STR, you\u2019re required to charge guests a room occupancy tax equal to 7-9% of the room's rate and send that money to the Puerto Rico Tourism Company (PRTC). A significant percentage of STR aren\u2019t registered with the PRTC \u2014 [in 2021, only about 4,000 of the estimated 25,000 STRs were duly registered](https://www.camara.pr.gov/asociaciones-de-hospederias-reclaman-ley-uniforme-para-alquileres-a-corto-plazo/) \u2014 and those that are self report their revenue. [The PRTC estimates](https://www.elnuevodia.com/negocios/turismo/notas/estiman-que-el-gobierno-pierde-millones-por-no-fiscalizar-a-los-alquileres-a-corto-plazo/?r=44049) that the rate of room tax evasion last year was between 30-40%, which translates to ~$6M in lost revenue; some hotel associations claim the loss is more likely to be between $15M and $20M. Note that if you book through AirBNB, you\u2019ll automatically be charged for the occupancy tax, regardless of whether the business is in compliance with the PRTC.\n\n- **Property taxes:** Owners STR properties often [claim them as their primary place of residence (en el CRIM) or purposely fail to notify their change to commercial use](https://www.elvocero.com/economia/otros/bajo-la-lupa-los-alquileres-a-corto-plazo-en-el-pa-s/article_dadfa3de-c68b-11ec-b19f-6bb72b9c4faf.amp.html) to take advantage of tax exemptions that don\u2019t apply to rental properties. This is reportedly a major problem among foreign investors who buy multiple properties through corporations, because of the difficulty of tracing properties back to the owners, who aren\u2019t the ones running their businesses.\n\n- **Municipal license taxes:** In municipalities like Dorado that require business owners to take out a license to run STRs, [the compliance rates are abysmal](https://www.elnuevodia.com/negocios/turismo/notas/estudio-revela-la-existencia-de-sobre-22000-habitaciones-de-alquileres-a-corto-plazo-en-puerto-rico/?r=73528).\n\n- **Utility rates:** It\u2019s not a tax, but it\u2019s common practice for owners of STR properties to not report that property is being used for commercial purposes to avoid paying commercial rates for water and electricity. \n\nYou made some good points about the potential for income tax evasion, but I don\u2019t know enough to say whether loss of tax revenue from unreported income is a major problem with STRs. However, I don\u2019t think the people running unregistered STRs to have an alternate source of income are tripping over themselves to report the money they made through their side hustle, lol.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that, although the tax evasion is less than ideal, a much more immediately pressing issue for residents is [gentrification, displacement, and the rapid loss of affordable housing in residential areas](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/us/puerto-rico-gentrification.html?unlocked_article_code=ajHt-bJb_QdBvasCqniqgw8m5EODfu6OVPRAqbAakGSyjX_H0Mv7kOBTJanNw7OkkJ_p4H-um-1BtbPyGIkMZuTWfqI-D9w8WfpR4d7EeAsKFtX_bmyf25IJQnT4PUABtijh2Vtv-RuZ8_gnNvG-vk9pYCwrUownEgiyUMFxG4Qd-TewwthBsRddwlJQ_N5cjVPkQp6wmuFtbgBunBO_ALFHrduF23JaUT6cFegrhkO_DzvoIv3V10uyECV64kF9DZNER2rRPQNDQHcLrYXo1NeYOJArkAVopzrplMICM-RUquf6MU-2euC6RFf_iFupogSGr_BlVY8SKdwG9ikLFw&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) that are becoming increasingly commercialized.\n\nEdit: format",

It's my initiative after tasting their shitty crumbly brownie (which was very weird since it's a pretty fancy place with good quality food). I probably will never have the guts to actually give them the recipe. Anyway, the problem is I have never worked in kitchens and didn't receive any formal cooking training so I'm a bit lost in this thing I want to try. \\*to note : I'm actually a great cook I just am lost when it comes to some technical details\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk so, let's talk cooking. In my original recipe I use a brown butter with espresso powder in it to help \"intensify\" the flavours in the brownie. Though since I'm trying to re-write that recipe for a place that sells actual coffee I thought I would try to include their coffee in it. But I'm not really sure how to proceed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy initial idea is : make the brown butter, filter the milk solids, add some ground coffee, place in a heat proof container, put that in the oven at like 150F, wait for ? minutes/hours, filter again and finally \"add back\" the evaporated water (I need to do that for texture reasons)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo with this idea I'm not sure it's really optimal and I'm even less sure that it would work without burning the coffee or the butter. (not to mention that I don't know if 150F is hot enough to avoid the \"danger zone\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there a better way to do what I'm trying to do ?  should I just add coffee instead of water to the brown butter ? Should I just add coffee in a completely different manner ? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS : I don't need to be explained like I'm 5, I had organic chemistry in college I can handle food science/chemistry\n\nPPS : Sorry if it's written weird I'm a 50/50 french and english person, sometimes my brain works in both languages at the same time and it fucks up my writing."

Sometimes, authors are added just because of their reputation despite having zero contribution to the work. Other times people who contributed might be left out.\n2. Q1 journals are bloody difficult to publish in. If you're aiming for one, be prepared to put in months of work.\n3. There are essentially two categories of journals: (1)  layman scientific journals (2) specialised scientific journals. The journals in the first category tend to have high impact factors (10+) because the information is accessible to the wider public (e.g. nature) while the latter mainly attracts researchers within relevant fields. Q1 journals under the specialised scientific journals category range between 5-10.\n4. The presentation of your results and the \"logical flow\" of your literature review/introduction could make or break your entire article.\n\nFight the good fight friends, godspeed !"

The simulation of modern music plus the stagnant nature of \"noise\" will both come through with classical music and help satisfy your ADHD need for novelty AND your autistic need for consistency and predictable ambiance.\n\nOne thing I'll add is that you can also find the most fitting classical music for whatever event/mood/circumstance/purpose that pertains to you at the moment. Some classical music is fitting for productive, upbeat stretches of time, while others are best for processing emotions or spending casual time with family/friends, etc. Just have to do a tiny bit of research. :)\n\nI never organically fell in love with classical music, but I recognized the value on a neurological level to the point where I can enjoy it in a different (more therapeutic) way than before! Remember, all that is hated is learned, and as such is loved!\n\nI don't \"love\" classical music the same way I become enthused by the novelty of experimental pop sounds or the nostalgic vibes of early 2000s alt rock... BUT,  I love it in a way that I never felt before - for its ability to produce positive feelings I need, yet otherwise wouldn't feel without it. \n\nSource: I am autistic and have ADHD.",

After walking the streets all night, I finally found somewhere I could charge my phone. By then, it was too late. I couldn't even get a charge in time to let them know what was going on.\n\nI was so mortified and I know how this industry works, so I knew there was nothing I could say that would make it better; I ended up never contacting them about it.\n\nI booked them through Casting Networks and I'm wondering if there's some kind of ranking/rating system that actors get regarding their professionalism. Like, if I never report to set, could the people who cast me rate me poorly and hurt my chances of getting seen in future castings?\n\nNothing like this has ever happened before and I anticipate learning from this and doing a better job of handling this kind of situation in the future. If there is some kind of shadow banning done by Casting Networks that affects actors' reputation, is there some way I can contact them to do damage control? I would hate for this experience to screw up my chances.\n\nTL;DR I screwed up a booking.

Their casting calls are vague and omit most of their intended usage, strategically offer less than you're worth for their unfair terms so that they can bribe you with more to make it seem like a deal if you try to negotiate, then get back to you so late that you're pressured into letting them exploit you. To top it off, if they decide to dump you for fighting for what you deserve, don't expect that response until the midnight before the shoot, after you've already packed your bag with the suitcase full of clothes they asked you to bring BEFORE they ever even sent you the contract.\n\nMore often than not, contracts with unfair terms are either copied and pasted from templates online or just offer as little as they can for as much as they can get away with because it's less of a headache and more money for them; typically, if asked for limits on usage and or better pay, they oblige because they didn't really *need* the original terms to begin with. This producer, however, knew exactly what they were doing from the moment they told me to hold the shoot date, all the way up to the disrespectfully late moment they rejected my negotiated terms. I canceled my attendance to a wedding, took off of work, and spent hours putting together/taking pictures of wardrobe options, only to spend more hours trying to renegotiate this unfair contract that I (should not have) assumed I'd have no problem changing if I needed to.\n\nI'm still fairly new, but have enough experience to know that this seemed really fishy. I called my ex (a casting director for many years) and he wasn't surprised, but agreed they were especially predatory. I asked him what I should do and I couldn't believe how much I learned about the business side of things from him. So grateful.\n\nIf enough actors started rejecting contracts claiming usage rights in perpetuity, negotiating pay, educating other actors, and calling out predators, we'd set a different standard. Maybe Backstage would force usage terms to be listed on calls. I'd love a more effective platform for actors to share information and put unethical industry companies out of business.\n\nWe shouldn't have to learn through career-risking experiences with manipulative producers what we deserve. I knew enough going into this career to protect myself fairly well, but I still wasted so much time and put life on hold for nothing this week. I hope some influencer-actor starts a series where they turn stories like this into viral videos, or some tech-savy actor makes a website for N/U actors to publicly call out this kind of thing (with names). Until then, I know it was my responsibility to know not to invest so much time into a project before asking for usage details, a contract, etc. and I learned my lesson.\n\nP.S. Are we allowed to use company names on here if we wanna publicly drag them?"

To me, this sounds like unprofessional laziness..\n\nA 50% bump is substantial, but I've been working long enough to know it might not be worth it. On the other hand, how likely will it really affect my career? I want to know what you guys think: Is working for contracts that can use your image \"in perpetuity\" always a deal-breaker? Or should it be more nuanced than that? What should I do/how should I respond?"

But am pretty dominant in air (Sun, Jupiter, and Uranus in Aquarius, Mars in Libra). I\u2019m also pretty strong in Earth (Moon in Virgo, Mercury, Venus, and Neptune in Capricorn along with Taurus MC). What I see in myself is that I have a hard time relating to the feelings of others and connecting emotionally with them. But I find with my strong air, I\u2019m able to understand why the feel the way they do. I\u2019m able to do see things from their perspective through understanding why they would feel the way they do. Or even with my strong Earth energy being able to help them out in a practical way and just being a steady presence and being supportive when they need it.  \n\nSo thoughts? Do you find yourself able to make up for a low element in a chart through your stronger elements? Examples would be very much appreciated."

Since they ain\u2019t here let\u2019s express our honest opinions unfiltered \ud83d\ude02\n\nBetas: My favorite Quadra other than Alphas. I just love how they are pretty lively with that Fe valuing but also have that ambition and desire to change the world!! They also don\u2019t activate my Te Polr. There definitely a Quadra that I would party with and or fight social causes with! If I had to pick any other Quadra besides Alpha I\u2019d pick Betas!! \n\nGammas: I have a few Gamma SF friends. I do enjoy them for the most part. I like their loyalty when they\u2019ve decided that you are the friend. It\u2019s cool to see the Se-Fi approach to the SF functions. However, communication can be tricky with them and I sometimes think they\u2019re strong Fi judgements of people can be harshly judgemental at times though. I do admire how with their Se+Te combo they can be very productive and ambitious. \n\nDeltas: Deltas are awesome for being able to just chill and enjoy the moment with. They also have a really good sense of subdued dry humor. However, they can be a bit boring and kinda into the normal life. They also don\u2019t seem to care too much about the collective and I can perceive them as being selfish. I have to tone down my Fe a lot around them (especially with the introverts). They also can activate my Te Polr with unsocilated practical advice \ud83d\ude44\n\nSo what are your thoughts about the other Quadras?"

I did find that Safoo has a Soundcloud with open DMs (which hasn't been uploaded to in 12 years), and Electroreptil has an old email listed on Discogs, both of which I will try to use to make contact.  \n\n\nAre there any other possible ways to recover the track if attempting to reach out to either the artist or the label goes nowhere?"

Was it worth it?\n\nEven on a normal day, it's just so goddamn awful. Those massive bumps just toss you around, especially if you're in a car with stiffer suspension. If youre not paying attention while driving or don't have the best control over it, I could see someone losing control and getting into an accident because of them, and there's no shortage of accidents. And of course, nobody knows how to use the damn left lane. Always going 65 in a 70 for miles at a time.\n\nThere have been a lot of thorough highway rebuild efforts across Michigan the past few years, so credit where it's due, but god dammit the local section of US 23 is straight chopped liver.

This is due to stock pricing or similar data series being diversely multifactorial in behavior, on which short term regression (graph analysis) is proven to be VERY poorly correlated to any increase in success.\nBinary operation trading is a field of study in which there is no timely feedback, no reproducibility of results, no clear stages of difficulty, and no validity of correlation between regression and success ratio.\nThere are several ways to make money consistently using binary operations, but trading via graphical analysis is not one of them.",

This means i cannot for the life of me change to another set by getting pieces of another.\n\nIm assuming its part of the game's hidden mechanics to help you get more pieces of the set you want, but its being very annoying because now i want to get some of the others for other occasions (like if i want a different set for a different place / shaal'baas for boss / flagellant for rifts and farming / vithu's urge for pvp)\n\nis anyone having the same experience of dropping ONLY pieces of the set you already have equipped?\n\nto clarify even further, i've ran dungeons over 50 times, at different days, many of which i specifically wait for it to be my first legendary drops of the day, and only gotten either no legendary/set drops, or pieces of the set i already am wearing.\n\nDoes anyone seem to be experiencing the same?"

I even took part Bald Dwarves at that time with my MS (I've saw their post here and didn't know they were still active and part of Reddit community), I've got EK 130 skill 99/89, RP 62 skill 99, MS 120 ML 70, all with full ekips and a few KK in the bank.\u00a0\n\nBut I've decided to start new in Serenebra (new server) since the game had lots of improvements and no more bots in the hunts. The problem is I don't know if this is the right choice, on this server I am playing on RP lv58 dist 80, very poor with about 200k on bank, I don't like to PG so I've doing tasks and missions.\u00a0\n\nShould I stay on this new server and maybe funnel some Tibia coins from my other chars to help me in the beginning, or go back to my old server and have easier life? My plan is to focus on either RP.\n\nI appreciate any insight on this :)"

I heard it's normal at the beginning to want to eat all of the no-no foods that once were limited or restricted, that it's part of the process. Eventually, this mindset will change and the urge to eat them will lessen.\n\nI've restricted myself so much in the past that I find it frightening giving myself freedom as the restriction indubitably leads to binging/overeating which is a huge problem I've had in the past. I'd be interested to hear stories of those who are more experienced with IE that can give me some insight into how they ditched their habits of overeating.\n\nDue to my strained relationship with food, I find it extremely difficult to sense hunger cues and satiety cues. For the latter, I believe I should exercise eating more satiating foods at a slower pace. But because of intermittent fasting and restriction, I have forgotten how to sense hunger. I noticed I can go a whole day without eating and not experience \"hunger\" because for so long I've only viewed food as an aid to help me look a certain way or to satisfy my emotional hunger.\n\nI also would like to start building muscle and I know a lot of that is based off performance and progressive overload. I know eating high protein sources whilst practicing IE will definitely yield me strength and muscle, but sometimes I worry the effort I put in exercising may go down the drain if I don't eat sufficiently. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you could offer me some insight, give advice, or simply share your experiences, it would be more than well-appreciated :)"

They are one of these Christian couples, complete commitment, no sex before marriage (they dated for 5 years, yess). \n\nHe\u2019s a priest. \n\nTurns out he tried killing himself 3-4 times already. They have three kids and once he left a note on a table that they\u2019re not gonna see him again. They went out looking for him \u2014 and found him hiding in the woods. The only reason he survived was because the branch broke, as he later told me. \n\nTurns out she married him at 29 only because she had low self esteem and didn\u2019t think she could find another guy, and didn\u2019t want to end up like some of her friends, 35-40 and unmarried without kids. \n\nTurns out they don\u2019t even sex life (not something I wanted to know about but whatever), but he\u2019s more than happy to flirt with other younger girls and I suspect he might be cheating. \n\nWe didn\u2019t talk much for the last few years since I\u2019ve been busy with my own life, lived in another country completely. \n\nBut I\u2019ve been living with them for a month now. And my sister just keeps teeling how fucked up her life is. How she can\u2019t even talk to him because all he does is sits at his phone the whole day, can\u2019t handle kids (3 of them, all younger than 6yo), can\u2019t make any decisions. \n\nShe makes all the decisions (he even can\u2019t handle his own parish, so she even helps him with that).\n\nShe\u2019s the one who\u2019s motivated to go out there and do things. He just follows her lead. And he\u2019s okay with that. \n\nI see how much it annoys my sister: she wants a husband whom she can share her life with \u2014 and not a boy who does as he\u2019s told and won\u2019t do anything if she doesn\u2019t tell him. \n\nThe guy doesn\u2019t have any motivation or desire to live. Completely dependent on her. \n\nThe only thing he truly wants is to go back to serve in the army (as he did before becoming a priest). \n\nAnd once she starts blaming him for not doing anything or not thinking with his own head \u2014 he starts screaming, punching walls and blaming her for all of his problems. \n\nHe acts like a kid. \n\nLast week I had to follow him to wherever he was going after the very heated argument. And we ended up spending 10 hours in a bar during the day, I was afraid he could do some harm to himself, I was trying to calm him down. \n\nEvery night I\u2019d stay up until 2-3am, listening to my sister\u2019s cry for help. And unfortunately there isn\u2019t much she could do, besides going to psychologist and trying to stay calm. \n\nHe\u2019s making all the money, it\u2019s his car and the house they stay in \u2014 he\u2019s a priest so he kinda gets it all now. \n\nAnd I\u2019m just confused af. I\u2019m tired of this all. I\u2019m trying to launch a business with my sister, so I quit my job, moved away from Europe and immigrated to the US. Was thinking I could stay with them for the time being, but with all of this now\u2026. Idk. I feel lost. \n\nAnd not sure if I can help my sister somehow. Or I should just move the fuck out. \n\nNot even sure she\u2019ll be able to continue working on a business with me. Or her husband will kill himself later down the line, and her life will be a complete mess. \n\nIt\u2019s a very tough situation. And I just\u2026 idk\u2026 what would you do? \n\nTL;DR I moved in with my sister, her husband and their 3 kids. Turns out they have a VERY unhealthy relationship. I don\u2019t know if should keep staying here and building a business with her. Or move out and go my separate way."

Like the gears just aren't turning properly at the given moment. It slows down the momentum of moving toward what I want. But given my current level of knowledge about it all, I know the machine doesn't stop, and it certainly doesn't take me backward. \n\nFor people struggling at the very beginning of all this, though, I could see the frame of mind, the grasping, and the constant questioning, being indicative of some people having never even crossed the starting line, to begin with. I think small steps at the start of this practice are crucial for people learning about it all from an online or word-of-mouth perspective. Just hearing or reading about this sort of thing, in my opinion, very likely does not have the same effect on the mind and body as it does on someone who stumbles upon it in a sudden moment of dazzling spiritual realization. This is only my take, of course, but I feel like it holds some modicum of truth.\n\nI discovered the law of attraction back in my early twenties through word of mouth and tried a few \"rituals\" to enact it. Ended up losing interest pretty quickly because I just didn't have any skin in the game regarding it. Seven years later, after a significant personal loss and one life-altering moment in the woods that simply defied all reasonable logic, I crossed the starting line. And it's been a marathon of magic and awe the entire two years since. Some stumbling along the way is to be expected in the process, but getting back up and persisting in the knowledge of magic is key. \n\nThank you for sharing your thoughts with us, both of you. \ud83d\udc95",

                "body": "The thing that worked best for me was essentially self-prescribed brainwashing. I'm not a visual person,  my mind's eye doesn't conjure up images for me properly, and my perceptive reality exists in word format within my head. No visual imagery, just thoughts and feelings/emotions.\n\nSo I started scripting about two and half years ago. Just writing things down that I really wanted in my life. And they started coming true, the simpler things. But the thing that really kicked my life into shape was positive sleep affirmations. 8 hour \"I Am\" tracks tailored to the thing you want to believe about yourself, spoken at a low volume near you while you sleep. You can find a variety of them on YouTube, but I'm very partial to Dylan James. He has a wide variety of topics and playlists on his channel, just comb through and pick one.\n\nThe idea is that these statements are spoken to you at night while you sleep, and they essentially skip to the front of the line regarding the thoughts you think. They bypass your waking, conscious thoughts while you're asleep and slip straight into your subconscious mind. It takes a bit of time and consistency, though; I would recommend picking one track for the thing you want most right now, and listen to it for at least a month straight at night. You can use headphones or a Bluetooth speaker beside your bed, either does the trick. But you're less likely to knock a Bluetooth speaker off than you are a pair of headphones. I much prefer the speaker method.\n\nIf you end up liking this method, also check out Jessica Heslop's affirmation tracks. She has a wider variety of topics to pick from, but Dylan is a wonderful starting point. His earliest videos also go into greater explanation about the subconscious mind and all that junk. \n\nI hope that this helps at least a little bit. Our realities are truly built on the mindset we live in, as well as the beliefs we hold about ourselves. Sometimes we just gotta dig the old programming out and replace it with something new and improved.",

Well, this is exactly what people are referring to when they talk about them. They are your insecurities, about whatever things in particular. This thing, whatever it is, is your insecurity and your limiting belief.\n\nNow, this is only my opinion based on my experiences alone, but the thing you should focus on, singularly and with intent, is banishing that insecure limiting belief that you have and replacing it with a new idea or belief that you would like to hold about yourself. There are a number of ways to go about that, but you yourself will certainly have to find which method fits you best. I can share with you my particular method that helped me if you're interested, but I'm going to stress up front that the one which will end up helping you might not be the one that worked for me -- or anyone else in this sub. The methods for changing self concept seem to tend to take hold on a personal level, and you kind of just fall into them. I don't know how to explain it much better than that. \n\nLong story short, if you change the current story about yourself that your mind essentially has downloaded, the beliefs you hold about yourself, into something new and that you want to believe, your world will change to reflect those beliefs.",

Or at the very least, maybe some comforting words from any ladies who have been sterile at least as long as I have. \n\n\nThe end of next month will be a full year sterile from my bisalp for me. It's been a perfectly fine road since, healing and expectations-wise. However, I find myself in a bit of a moment right now that has my lizard brain in full blown panic mode. I find myself on day 34 of my usual 28 day cycle, and I'm doing my best not to go off the rails in my worry. \n\n\nOne thing I have noticed about my particular set of circumstances, when I started regularly tracking my cycles about two years ago on the calendar, is that around every seven months, I have a particularly long cycle, about nine or ten days lengthier than normal. And when I say that this is a pattern, I mean that it has happened consistently every seven months since August 2021, and it's falling perfectly in sequence this month, assuming that things start back up in the next three or four days for me, and that I'm not the next medical paper anomaly.\n\n\nSo, what I'm really asking, is: has anyone else in here experienced this sort of thing with their cycles, particularly after but definitely not limited to a bilateral salpingectomy? And can things be looked into after some time has passed to make sure that everything in there is still as it should be (openings left behind from the tubes cauterized and the like)? How have you ladies with longer amounts of time out from your procedures faired? I appreciate any engagement here, and wish you all nothing but a beautiful Wednesday.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to swing back around and say that my cycle ended today, 10/16/22, at a total of 38 days. I was ten days late, just like the last two times I documented this occurrence, each event separated by seven months. I'll be going to have my hormones checked this Friday, and I will see about having another appointment set up in May (seven months from now) to see if I can catch the pattern, if it keeps itself going. \nFor any women reading this in the future with concerns, I hope this might provide you with a little peace of mind."

                "body": "Eight months ago I met my most recent partner. They were presented to me in the most mystical way by my soul's reckoning, damn near with a neat little bow on top and surrounded by gobs of synchronicities. We both believed in the same universal concepts: LOA, mirroring, and all manner of spirituality. It was an absolutely beautiful connection that taught me many valuable lessons, such as how to set and maintain boundaries and my own personal power while sharing my life with another soul. And the journeys we embarked on together are memories I will carry with me for the rest of my life, particular moments captured perfectly in certain songs I came to love during our time together.\n\nAnd on Sunday it all came to a screeching, unavoidable halt. This punctuation at the end of our story together is neither reversible, nor is it something that can be mended, because it goes against one of the single most important boundaries to me. This ending is as much a lesson as the rest of the relationship, as well as every experience prior to it. It's the lesson that the universe will continue to send to me until I get it right. And I think I got it right this time.\n\nI believe we are pretty overtly taught from an early age to exist small, to yield to others and want to give almost entirely of ourselves for the benefit and comfort of those around us. Many of us are taught that declaring boundaries for ourselves is wrong, and people certainly act in kind once you start making the conscious decision to do so. But every time you choose to yield to those around you rather than to the truth inside of you (that gut feeling you get, or that thing that you absolutely cannot abide by), life will continue to send you that very same lesson meant to teach you to honor that truth, wrapped up pretty and differently each time, until you get it right.\n\nAnd you will know when you get it right, because the growth you will feel will be immeasurable. To turn back and deny your truth will feel like trying to crawl inside a box that is entirely too small for you. There will be a peace when you finally choose that truth in you over the external person or thing you think you desire so badly. The path ahead of you will just feel right; you'll know that you are going to be okay when it's all said and done, and you will walk onward in love and peace.\n\nThe Law is absolutely real and it will send you exactly what you want if you believe it will. But it's doing it not entirely for what you desire, but what you need. Once you figure out what it is you need, and you honor it, the rest can only begin to fall in place. \n\nI'm sorry for the long-winded soap box talk, but I found a piece of my puzzle this weekend, and I only hope that everyone out there will be able to do the same. I believe it's the only way we can heal our world, in compassionate, but strengthened unity. Love yourself as much as the other that you adore, and your world will come together, I promise."

But I've been practicing the law of attraction and manifestation in small ways for the past year and some change after a spiritual experience with a deceased loved one sent me looking for answers. In that time I have found both answers and infinitely more questions to go in search for new solutions to, and it's just been one wild ride. Even despite the worldly chaos around me, I feel protected and genuinely happy with my lot in life in the present moment. I would love to share my most recent success story that absolutely lit my entire soul on fire, for as simple a thing as it was.\n\nI work in a records room type setting, and I keep to myself for the most part during my shifts. But most people at least know of me, as I enjoy dressing in a particular fashion and wearing my hair in bright colors. Anyway, this girl that works in a separate but parallel department from mine comes in daily to deliver mail to my team, and a few weeks ago came in wearing the absolute prettiest dress I had seen in some time. I expressed to her how much I liked it, and she told me where she bought it. Well, I went looking for it last week with my mom and couldn't find it. Bummer, but I digress. \n\nEnter that same coworker today: she comes up to my cubicle holding a plastic bag, and sheepishly proceeds to tell me that she hopes what she's about to do isn't completely weird. She hands me the bag and tells me that she went thrifting over the weekend, when she saw the exact same dress on the rack that I had fawned over. She told me that the one she owned was a couple years old, and that she knew I wouldn't find it at the store anymore. So when she saw this one on the rack at the thrift store, she herself thought it was a sign and she bought it for me.\n\nI almost started crying for how excited and lit up my entire being felt when she gave me the dress, despite it being a relatively small thing in the grand scheme of universal magic and manifestation. It was just so blunt and obvious, just one of those personal experiences that you can't deny or ignore. This girl and I are not super close, we only ever see each other in passing, but the way the world turned and played out that specific turn of events was pure magic, and my child like sense of wonder has been renewed yet again. \n\nI know it's not a grand, life shattering tale of magic and wonder, but I just wanted to share my newest experience in LOA. I sincerely hope you all are thriving and living your best existences out there. Life has the ultimate potential to be beautiful in the most unexpected of ways, and I hope each and every one of you finds your proof and hope in the magic. Blessed be. \ud83d\udc95"

I had initially scheduled and chickened out of my first approved procedure after giving my father a simple courtesy call. His response, compared to my mother and stepfather's support and total understanding, was not at all what I had been expecting, and he shook my resolve. Add in a fear of having never undergone any major surgery in my life so far, and I canceled my appointment.\n\nThe following three months were spent in damn near constant paranoia of an accident, despite my IUD, and ultimately culminated in my most recent cycle being nine days late. Cue the worst anxiety I've had in years. Now that I'm in the clear and certain of what I do not want in life, I'm scheduled once more to have my procedure done in November.\n\nI'm so excited to know that, moving forward, my reproductive capabilities will be entirely my choice and not left up to chance. Ladies out there taking comfort in this sub, I hope you are able to find the resources you need to do what you need to do, and just know that your choice regarding your life and body are 100% valid.

I had normal periods and didn\u2019t have the hormonal side effects that effect me on other birth control. \nHowever I became concerned after having pain in my right ovary and my cycle began 2 weeks late. I made an appointment with my gyno just to check that it wasn\u2019t cysts or displacement. Sadly the Paraguard has traveled extremely low and I have to get it removed. The doctor said it\u2019s possible it wasn\u2019t seated properly and then migrated? I\u2019m just lost because I really like this method but I don\u2019t want to reject again.\nIve tried Mirena, it gave me dryness, obliterated my sex drive and heightened my depression. \nWhen I was on Depo I was gaining weight like crazy.\nI hate hormones and hate that my body is doing this.\nI\u2019m just at a loss if I wanted to risk it with another Paraguard insertion or try something else. The Mirena made me miserable and terrified of hormones. \nHas anyone rejected and had success on second insertion?\nShould I look into the pill or the ring and risk hormone issues?"

I try to keep my looks up, i work full-time, i goto school full-time, cook dinner, clean, try to be there for him emotionally, i try to keep sex to at least 4-6 times a week. If he needs something we go out, we have a lot in common like music and movies and tv shows. In no way am I perfect i sadly am insecure and do get jealous, i think i complain too much. About a year ago he was rejected by a girl who was practically a super model and from others I've heard that she was the girl of  his dreams. He is still friends with her on Facebook and likes her pictures but says he doesn't feel that way about her anymore so i trust him. I know it sounds stupid but he doesn't like my stuff on Facebook, i feel like he's not happy anymore. It makes me sad so it ruins his mood and makes it worse. Im not asking to be the one because we are only 18 i just wanna make him happy and feel appreciated. He doesn't talk about me to other people he doesn't have pictures of me on social media and doesn't have that he's in a relationship. I love him and don't want him to regret the time we've been together."

It does serve a purpose too, it's designed to get a recruiter to message me to ask more -- to stand out from the other 500 applicants to a position. To that end it really does work. I don't want people to get a complete picture of me by reading it, I want it to motivate them to message or setup a meeting to talk to me. It's not a tool not an endpoint.\n\nThat said, there's a job opening that is REALLY interesting looking to me. I apply to about 2-3 jobs a year and go on a interview at least once a year to stay fresh -- even though I've worked the same job almost 12 years now and dont plan on leaving -- but this new opening I saw looks REALLY enticing and I'd like to actually try on this one.\n\nMy question to the community is this: Do you hide your ASD in your linkedin profile, or do you let it out? Those of you who attempt to blend in and have a \"normal\" linkedin profile, do you feel it helps? Those who don't care and yours is either out of date or grimly sardonic, do you feel it hurts? How have you found to get your social media to give you an *advantage* as someone with ASD?"

Still not usable in this state though :(\n\nedit2:\n\nthe problem as it currently stands:\n\nSDWAN balancing and failover between WAN1 and WAN2\n\nlaptop static assigned to 192.168.1.2 and plugged into fortigate port 1\n\ninternet works\n\nrun failover test: unplug WAN1, internet good, plug back in, wait 2 mins. unplug WAN2, internet fails, plug back in, wait 2 mins.\n\nUNASSIGN laptop and let the fortigate assign a dhcp address (gets assigned 192.168.1.110).\n\nredo failover test, both internets run great!\n\nreassign laptop to different static: 192.168.1.100\n\nredo failover test, fails again.\n\nreassign laptop to different static WITHIN the dhcp space: 192.168.1.140\n\nfailover test works.\n\nedit3:\n\nseems to be related to VIPs. when I change the two VIPs that handle the incoming traffic to 1.9 (away from 1.2 where the laptop is), the SDWAN failover starts working for 1.2. Still not sure of a fix though.\n\nedit 4:\n\nafter upgrading firmware on your fortigate, FACTORY RESET it and reload your config scripts from scratch. this solved it for me. the config was fine all along it seems... it was the device that was malfunctioning and needed cleared."

It then travels for 20 m horizontally before starting back up an 8\u00b0 incline. It travels 80 m along this incline before coming to rest. What is the magnitude of the net work done on the sled by friction?\\]\n\nThe book gives the answer in the back: 1900 J\n\nSo the way i approached this problem was to break it up into 3 sections. I figure, i can find the Work done by friction for each segment, and add it together to get the net work done by friction.\n\nusing:  Wf = -Fk \\* d and Fk =  \u03bck \\* n , and  \u03bc =.1 (idk if this is right, the book gives a table of friction coefficients, but it's not specified what kind of sled, or if its on snow or anything..)\n\ni come up with  \u03a3 Wf = Wf1 + Wf2 + Wf3\n\nWf1 = -\u03bck \\* n \\* d --->  - \u03bc \\* mg \\*cos(**\u03b8**) \\* d ---> (.1)(70\\*9.81)(cos(10))\\*80 = -5410 J  ( already this is way too much according to the book)\n\nWf2 = - \u03bck \\* n \\* d ---> \u03bck \\* mg \\* d ---> -0.1 \\* 70\\*9.81 \\* 20 = -1373 J\n\nWf3 = -\u03bck \\* n \\* d ---> - \u03bc \\* mg \\*cos(**\u03b8**) \\* d ---> (.1)(70\\*9.81)(cos(8))\\*80 =-5440\n\n\u03a3 Wf = 12223 J  pretty far from 1900 J ...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help would be appreciated!

They are my friends. I just thought of him as my friend.\n\nToday our friend group of 6 (him and I included) got drunk. He asked to lay on my lap and I said yes. I would allow my friends to do this regardless their gender. He suddenly said \"I love you\" and I STILL DIDN'T GET IT. He continued with \"Will you go out with me?\". I was dumbfounded. Don't get me wrong I absolutely love him, just not romantically.\n\nWe sat in quiet for a while. I apologised repeatedly. He said something like \"It is not your fault it is mine\" I said \"It is not a fault to feel human emotions\" He asked me if I'm gonna stop hanging out with him. \n\nI still want to be friends with him. Like I said I love him. But I don't want to get his hopes up.\n\nP.S: I don't want any \"You're not 21, don't use alcohol\" comments.

I hate how straight girls' are obsessed with mlm stuff and they don't like wlw stuff because there is no cute boy to watch. \n\nToday we were walking me, her and a friend of us who didn't know I was bi. She suddenly said \"I don't believe that you're bisexual\". She outed me to that friend. Then she went back and forth about why she didn't think I was bisexual. I never told my girl crushes to her. She said stuff like \"You're not bisexual if you never had a crush on a girl\". I was like you would never say that to a boy who said he was bisexual.

                "body": "Scientifically speaking, I researched more into this, after I watched this watch-mojo video, where the plague *Encephalitis lethargica* was revealed first time to me. Of course, I was amazed and intoxicated by this disease. And I researched into it. There are possible causes of *Encephalitis lethargica.*\n\n1. An infection which I thought involving brain\n2. Or a virus - this explains why it was spread so quickly\n3. And Encephalitis wasn\u2019t the only disease in 1920\u2019s, it is told that Measles infection promoted the occurence of Encephalitis.\n\nThe patients with symptoms had a statue-like demeanour, and they had abnormal facial expressions and fell into a sleep like phase, which was more likely a Coma phase. Now, Encephalitis lethargica patients were also had maniac like symptoms too, like crazy enough that patients couldn\u2019t be controlled easily. **What disease is more closer to a zombie virus plague than this, like in Maze runner?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[looks super scary, to me.](https://preview.redd.it/60k8yit3sq971.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2c9117cf725d22150ca1de503188b89de4f80128)\n\nThis, in return, suddenly reminded me of the classic tale, *the sleeping beauty.* I thought that her cause of illness is probably *Encephalitis Lethargica.* But, I wanted more facts. If Aurora had this illness, what did Maleficent do to cause her this?\n\n1. An infection or swelling in the brain\n\nI looked into the facts causing an infection in the brain. There were reasons like viruses or bacteria and chemicals. *Chemicals.* It occurred to me that Maleficent could have used a chemical to Aurora in that spindle to cause this illness. But what chemical? I looked into the chemicals to cause brain damage or cause coma or cause an infection, all reasons tying to Aurora. But there are number of chemicals, I can\u2019t say which one definitely but Maleficent could have used one out of following;\n\n1. Nitrobenzene (1854) could have used because Sleeping beauty was made in 1959.\n2. Sodium Hypochlorite (1785) could have used because Sleeping beauty was made in 1959.\n3. Tricholoethylene (1920) could have used because Sleeping beauty was made in 1959.\n4. Potassium Cyanide (1782 - Cyanide) could have used because Sleeping beauty was made in 1959.\n\nLikewise, there are MANY chemicals Maleficent could have used.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Maleficent the scary!](https://preview.redd.it/xm4xozm8sq971.jpg?width=459&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9689e63d96f864c43860e36df7e406adab44ca37)\n\nNext, I looked into the original *Sleeping beauty tale* to see more clues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The sun, moon and Thalia \\(17th century\\)](https://preview.redd.it/aou76wgesq971.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4c394b77897502b335103f8f1161a41bc567ff24)\n\nOriginal sleeping beauty tale is called as *The Sun, Moon and Talia (17th century)* In there, the princess Talia is fallen to sleep (Coma) by touching the flax Maleficent in disguise spun. This flax could have had any of those chemicals. So, the sleeping beauty must have fallen into the sleep and would you know, a king comes and **\\*sensitive content ahead\\*** raped her. Unbeknownst to her, after nine months, she had two twins which she named as the sun and the moon. Even after waking up, what she does next was instantly breastfeeding them, *as if she knew but was helpless.* Another sign of Coma, as the brain is active, but too weak to respond to external stimuli. Next, she finds the king with her children, king falls in love, and she becomes his mistress. The king had a wife already. The wife **\\*sensitive content ahead again\\*** orders the cook to kill and make the twins into the meat her husband usually eats. The cook kills two lambs instead. However, at the end, the wife died and Thalia and king lived happily ever after.\n\nThe only helpful fact from the original was that instead of the needle, the flax splinter was used to Aurora (Thalia).\n\nI turned into the Disney Sleeping beauty scene then. It showed Maleficent hypnotising her and she pricking the needle on the spindle. Honestly, the scene was scary for me as a child.\n\nHowever, I also thought it could be Hepatic Encephalopathy, which is a loss of brain function as a result of failure in the removal of toxins from the blood due to liver damage. In severe cases, it can cause Coma.\n\n**But, it seemed more logical that princess Aurora fell into a Coma not from a spindle or flax, but from a poisonous gas Maleficent had summoned, if the classic was realistic.**\n\n[Sleeping Beauty (1959) - Maleficent Hypnotizes Aurora - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJURRLYSN1o)\n\nBecause there are gases like Ammonia, Arsenic, Benzene as well as Carbon monoxide enough to make a person dizzy and make him/her fall into a Coma. It seem more plausible that Maleficent movie is realistic than the Disney classic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sleeping beauty pricking on the needle.](https://i.redd.it/kotjiairsq971.gif)\n\nAnyway, Aurora was NOT fallen into a Coma by a mere spindle, she was poisoned by chemical poisoning of the spindle or the flax and that was what caused her brain infection to be diagnosed with Encephalitis Lethargica to fall into the Coma or to fall into Hepatic Encephalopathy, which damaged her liver and then brain, making her to fall into Coma. Maybe, Maleficent with somehow, working her magic, cursed mean, metaphorically gave her a weak liver so that her toxin trick would work. Most Coma patients wake up. Likewise she must have woken up too (even after 100 years tbh)\n\nHowever, it is my belief that **it was not the prince Phillip or the king who woke up the princess,** but her children (original) whom must have cried, and the sound of loved ones can make Coma go away. **Or in the Disney version, the fairies (even though they were stupid) when they wailed and weeped, Aurora woke up (even though it took her 100 years and super weak) after hearing the voices of her loved fairies.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I like you begging - Maleficent](https://i.redd.it/bc5x7wzwsq971.gif)\n\nSo, there you have it. The real, scientific reason for her curse and what woke her up. *But, my personal favourite one is that;*\n\n1. **Maleficent used a deadly chemical on the spinning wheel spindle.**\n2. \\*\\*She (\\*\\****somehow)*** **bewitched her into it.**\n3. **Aurora touched it.**\n4. **The chemical was so strong, strong enough to make an infection in the brain instantly.**\n5. **So, the infection occurred, it triggered** ***Encephalitis lethargica.***\n6. **So, she went straight into the Coma, a stage of brain death. So, her parents thought she was dead and later they also deceased.**\n7. **Her fairy godmothers were weeping and refused to leave her bedroom until she wakes up, mourning throughout the 100 years.**\n8. **They always reminisced her favourite times throughout they stayed in her bedroom, while mourning.**\n9. **It took her a lot of energy and strength for Aurora to fight into the life she loved, and her fairy godmothers\u2019 mourning strengthened her motivation gradually.**\n10. **Finally, she woke up from the Coma and they lived happily ever after.**\n\n*In that way, there is no sexual content or false prince saviour, the victim and as well as the hero is Aurora herself. The antagonist is Maleficent.*\n\n**EDIT :  another theory user** u/notakuriboh **had commented, I found it interesting though.**\n\nAurora was poisoned by a lethal dose of [curare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curare) when she touched the poisoned spindle, and she fainted because she had a [blood-injection-injury phobia](https://theconversation.com/fight-flight-or-faint-why-some-people-pass-out-when-they-see-blood-or-feel-pain-57348).\n\nBy fainting, she reduced the initial severity of the poison as her blood pressure dropped enough to delay the poison from immediately reaching more important parts of her body like her diaphragm, which would cause her to die of asphyxiation.\n\nAs a result, her resulting paralysis was more localized to her skeletal muscles, which would mimic a [pseudocoma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked-in_syndrome).\n\nWhile curare would only paralyze her skeletal muscles and not her heart, since the slowed/stopped movement of her diaphragm would still prevent her from respiring normally, she'd still die from cardiac arrest after 4-6 minutes of not breathing.\n\nShe'd need some form of artificial respiration to keep her oxygen saturation above 85%, and since we don't see the fairies performing chest compressions, we can only assumed that they used some magic to push oxygen into her lungs.\n\nThat could in theory, allow her to maintain just a pseudocoma for years.\n\nIn this theory (like mine) even they were stupid, the fairies could have helped her back from her coma again by giving her oxygen using whatever the colourful magic they used.\n\n*Thank you for reading!*\n\n\\- Bloom -\n\nEdit : Thank you so much for the upvotes >3 (even though you upvoted maybe because I reminded you a childhood classic?)

Watch Film theory video\n2.  Read or watch the life of pi movie/book\n\nThe proof is *this* movie itself\ud83d\udc46 given below is a recap for those who don't know this book/movie.\n\nPlot - Pieseen Patel is an indian boy. His name is based on a famous pool in France, and his classmates made fun of him saying it's peeing for his name. Long things short, Pi's father, owns a zoo, and they decide to move to foreign seas, so they can sell animals for a higher price. Pi is devastated to leave his girlfriend and nationality. And the ship they travelled soon becomes a victim of a storm while travelling in the mariana trench. The animals are drowned, except for the Bengal tiger of their zoo, Richard Parker. Now, Pi is stuck in a boat with a tiger. He, actually *trains* this tiger, he has knowledge from his father, however, he comes to a foreign country (I can't remember if it's Canada or USA) and after a lot of unbelievable journeys, what is most remembered by him is that Richard Parker the tiger never glancing back at him after him returning to a jungle, after all of his struggle to keep it survive.\n\nEnough of storytelling. Let's get straight into the point. \n\n1. Training.\n\nYou see....that's the whole POINT! Fierce, wild animals like tigers can never be manipulated by humans to gain their own needs (unless...I dunno, you become a foster mom of a tiger cub like Jasmine? Or become a false mother of dragons from the birth of them like Daenerys, IDK how animals' childhood is affected by humans\ud83d\ude15) Pi... (a genius Sea-Bear-Grylls I would say) just spotting his rationality and resourcefulness and his confidence (and of course, a math talented) he is super intelligent.\n\n He trains the tiger exactly how it should be trained via a book. He throws a piece of raw fish meat to a spot, taps another spot using a wooden pole or something to another after throwing another piece of meat. That's how minds of these animals work. Like matpat said, \n\nFood + wild animal = Pet\n\n\n2. Emotions, just don't add up to them.\n\nProof no 1. - Now, this is a sad story with not so sad ending. Pi, says that the only reason that kept him alive, made him WANT to live was Richard Parker ITSELF. Because he feared it that if the tiger runs out of food, it will definitely eat the boy as the food. That's why he kept suffering to catch more and more fish to keep richard parker ALIVE. In this way, Pi grew to actually LOVE this ferocious animal. They both kinda helped each other. Tiger aroused his fear only to make him urge to live...put the life of sorrows back and put himself up after his devastation. This is why when Richard Parker left to the jungle of the new island, Pi cried. Because the tiger LEFT him and never, ever, even BOTHERED to look at him to denote a simgle GOODBYE. A single sign of love or friendship.\n\nProof no. 2 - When seeing back the film to the start, we see Pi...starting to serve Richard Parker a piece of meat via the iron bars of the cage. However, the tiger ALMOST eats his hand when his father rescues him. His dad is furious and says something similar to don't play with tigers or something. And...while Pi sees...his father serves the tiger an alive goat to the tiger and the tiger kills it as Pi's mother pulls Pi to her to stop him seeing. Tigers, as well as other predatory animals...don't care about anyone. They only want is FOOD. Food and survival is their only goals. They don't have a magic disney emotional bond between humans....they are naturally born to kill and feed. There's NO single emotional connection.\n\nIt's because it's a wild animal. Like MatPat said, relationships don't matter or don't fit in to these wild animals. They just do what is based on their instincts. That's why and how I'm bringing up this point to officially PROVE and discuss more about this incredibly old video.\n\n\nPut your ideas about this down there\ud83d\udc47"

But still scientists are searching for answers when it comes to genetics. \n\nWe know in the books and in the tv series Daenerys gets mad or out of control. But is this really a disorder or just her sadness? I have researched about this and a lot of people have claimed that Danny doesn't have bipolar (bipolar patients themselves) Not depression. Not even PTSD. Because, they have told that like depression patients PTSD patients blame themselves. Ex from fictions itself is Katniss Everdeen from THG. She blamed herself for not being in the right place at the right time to save her sister Prim. \n\nTurns out that inbreeding may not exactly cause the mental disorder inheritance from genes (a hypothesis) and it may cause physical changes more than mental disorders. The closest I could come to Danny's mental disorder was IED. Intermittent explosive disorder. The most common symptom is explosive bursts of unwarranted anger. \n\nWe know she had a traumatic past in every form of abuse. However, it is not much mentioned that whether IED passes from inbreeding...but it's said that if there's a chance or a possibility to occur a disorder like that inbreeding will promote it. Not IED specifically but other disorders too. But it is believed that IED CAN occur due to genetic factors, physical factors end environmental factors. Which, we know it can be rather impacted from Danny's traumatic past than inbreeding hereditary which might have promoted it. Maybe, Westeros triggered something of Danny to come out her rage with anger to burst out. It could have been in a longer time on Danny's heart.\n\nStill, it is unclear of Danny's mental disorder. And this needs more researching from a professional who also knows GOT much. (And I would like to know more about Genetics as it's a field I adore like, very much) This hypothesis-theory may or may not be true, but it is yours to investigate for yourself."

We have the best natural beauty, we don't have volcanoes like Japan, we have a good education, what else we need?  I'm lucky to be a Sri Lankan, I love my country. I hope you all do. \n\nSo, this is a big question we have. We have always learned our country is a developing country. But, USA, UK, take Japan or Singapore for an example! Why are those countries in a state of \"developed\" and we are still a \"developing\" country? Well, I'm here to answer.\n\nI had an American friend and my relatives are in UK and Australia. We all have the same requirements and we and Americans are same in most ways, it's not what you think, based on the Hollywood movies. Even that is because of our cultural differences. Most of them are cultured and good-mannered people, like us. What caused them to rise up and us to fall down?\n\nTake the language as an example. We know Sinhalese is our mother tongue, but, English is the international language. The mother tongue of most developed countries is English. But, developed countries like China also have Chinese Mandarin like languages to speak than English. Problem is that we depend too much on Sinhalese so that we don't know English at all. It's the hardest to find a good A/L teacher in English medium to teach Science. Why? We are not used to English. China maintains their mother tongue as well as English in a balanced condition. We lack that. \n\nWe are also still hold in the traditional ways like India. That's why we still thought a random \"pani\" will cure Coronavirus, which is not happening if you thought in a scientific way. They, think in Science. We, think in an old-fashioned way, still. It is true that in past we had some explicit ways of herbal medicine to cure pandemics, but, the fact is that people take advantages through it.\n\nNext is the quality. Do you know in USA, one can only pluck and eat an apple in orchards, but not the fallen ones? Is there such a policy in our country for fruit orchards? no. It is sad that even a packet of Cornflakes is expensive in our country, but in countries like UK, the price of such food is relatively low, so even a homeless man can afford it if he tried. We the don't eat the half they do. Our fruits and vegetables are toxic, but, do you know in a lot of foreign countries they are mostly fresh and new?\n\nWe have a lot to change. But, we can. We are the ones who invented the plane way before the Wright brothers could invent it. Why can't we do this? In this Corona period, let's dedicate our time to rise finally as a \"developed\" country than still a \"developing\" country.  Believe me, it will solve a lot of problems like brain drain."

It turns out the biggest plot twist was that Pennywise held into the grudge that Eddie had to die, that was totally wrong. That's why Pennywise killed Eddie at the end, still thinking it would weaken the losers. Even though Pennywise knew Richie's dirty little secret, he didn't know the consequences of his action. Even though he said that the poor shokopiwahs died, he did knew it could work/and almost worked, that's why he said that \"tell why it didn't work\" to Mike.\n\nMaybe he knew he was gonna be killed from all along so he tried using the technique of killing Eds to make them lose hope and give up. It wasn't the losers that were really afraid, it was the Pennywise himself. What Pennywise thought would stop the losers, turned out to make them a ladder to kill him. Losers had the luck all along, they didn't \"just\" received the luck from all of a sudden. I think it's one of biggest plot twists in the movies as well as in the book.\n\n#THEORY 2: In the previous movie, Stan slowed them by blaming them that they led him to the death.

You\u2019re right \u2013 there are very few people that pedal this stuff and would be taken seriously (who aren\u2019t faceless chatter on Twitter).\n\nWhat fascinates me is the sheer contrast between the discussion of pedophilia in the 2010s and now. The recent invention of the term \u201cMAP\u201d strikes me as an explicit attempt at normalization. The cult following is still so small that it\u2019s not of much concern, but it\u2019s the rate of change that shocked me. And those that *predicted* the explicit attempt at normalization were all berated and mocked 10 years ago.

First of all, I don\u2019t go clubbing or drink, and I\u2019ve never been in a relationship (much less have spicy stories of intimacy). Nor do I watch a lot of today\u2019s TV shows anymore.\n\nI mostly just live with my parents, programming and studying Theology \u2013 not exactly conversation starters among young adults of mixed interests. My \u201csafe\u201d nature (discernful nature?) might be prudent (and I don\u2019t want to antagonize it, really). But I can\u2019t help but feel like it left me at a social disadvantage. My personality and identity feel like a stale, bookish, well-behaved Catholic boy.\n\nAt least on the surface, many young adult Catholics around me are members of the church more because that\u2019s just \u201cwhere they grew up\u201d, so while Theology seems like a potential touch-point, in reality (sadly) it isnt. Matters of their faith don\u2019t take up as much of their time as they do mine, and they shine more colorfully due to their broader secular pursuits.\n\nI know personality is more than just a collection of interests and stories. Maybe it\u2019s also how I react to people\u2019s struggles and triumphs with grace, humor, playfulness, insightfulness, etc.?  *HOW* to do that is a mystery to me (would I have had more experience if I had \u201csheltered\u201d myself less?). \n\nDoes anybody have any similar struggles? Any advice?"

Phonotactics like assimilation would continue to make words more optimized for speaking. New terms would be coined for the new innovations and experiences.\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s difficult to contest.

Oklahomas themselves are very traumatising since a Coach punished me in front of everyone when I got scared, but if I'm alone it's a bit more manageable.\n\nI also asked my teammates to tackle me a bit (not full power) during no-tackling drills if possible.\n\nThe season is on for us and I would really like to be able to get on the gridiron and do something for my team, but I'm kinda running out of ideas.. so  I ask, do you have any coaching strategy to overcome fear of tackling?\n\nThanks for reading,  also English is not my mother tongue so apologies if there are any typos\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : Just a note to say thank you to everybody, you guys are really supportive and it feels so good!"

(Jamais de la joie)\n\nEssayer de les ressentir me donne une grande anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et me br\u00fble les jambes.\n\nTout ceci peut bien se produire dans une d\u00e9pression, je vous passe la sensation de vide, et perte de sens etc.\n\nJ'ai pris plusieurs traitements, \n-Sertraline (2 fois)\n-Effexort\n\n\nJ'ai pu sentir un l\u00e9ger mieux au niveau de l'humeur, mais aucun au niveau du brouillard de cerveau et des jambes.\n\nSi bien que je sentais que je remontais la pente jusqu'\u00e0 ce que les gr\u00e8ves m'emp\u00eachent d'aller en cours et cassent ma routine. \n\nSuite \u00e0 cela, ma copine de l'\u00e9poque ( qui savait tout depuis 2 ans) me quitte pour un ami commun, mon cas s'aggrave et je pique des crises de col\u00e8re et j'en garde un certain trauma encore de nos jours.\n\nSuite \u00e0 l'inefficacit\u00e9 des traitements, je les arr\u00eate. (Approuv\u00e9e par les m\u00e9decins).\n\nLa question se pose, est-ce que c'est psychologique ou physique ?\n\nUn neurologue me fait passer un scanner du cerveau mais on ne trouve rien.\n\nJe tente une th\u00e9rapie avec une neuropsychologue, mais elle me dit qu'elle ne peut rien pour moi apr\u00e8s plusieurs s\u00e9ances. (Ce serait donc dans ma t\u00eate).\n\nMe voil\u00e0 en th\u00e9rapie EMDR ( avec un psychologue),depuis 2 mois, c'est assez impressionnant, je ne peux pas dire que c'est inutile, mais rien ne s'am\u00e9liore au niveau jambe/concentration.\n\nR\u00e9cemment j'ai d\u00e9couvert que ces douleurs aux jambes pouvaient \u00eatre de la dysesth\u00e9sie (?), on pourrait calmer la douleur avec du bicarbonate de soude, surprise g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00e7a fonctionne mais je devrais en prendre tous les jours.\n\nJ'en parle \u00e0 mon m\u00e9decin qui me prescrit des patchs de Lidoca\u00efne, que je vais tester ce soir, ainsi qu'un IRM des lombaires.\n\nMon m\u00e9decin suspecte une douleur neuropathique d\u00fb \u00e0 une mauvaise disposition du dos, mais \u00e7a n'explique pas le brouillard de cerveau non ?\n\nDe mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 j'ai vraiment l'impression que c'est physique, je n'ai pas de raisons psychologiques d'aller aussi mal.\n\nBien s\u00fbr j'ai des restes et des traumas, mais de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale les choses vont bien.\n\n-J'ai de nombreux amis\n\n-J'ai une relation\n\n-Ma famille veille sur moi\n\n-J'ai un projet (certes peu concret mais j'en ai un)\n\n-Je fais du sport 4 \u00e0 5 fois par semaine.\n\nJe perds un peu espoir pour ma vie \u00e0 long terme bien s\u00fbr, j'ai d\u00fb abandonner mes \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes \u00e0 cause de ces soucis.\n\nJ'ai aussi l'impression que le corps m\u00e9dical ne sait pas quoi faire de moi, (je vous ai pass\u00e9 les psychiatres qui arr\u00eatent de me r\u00e9pondre sans pr\u00e9venir)\n\nDonc voil\u00e0 je lance une bouteille \u00e0 la mer en esp\u00e9rant que quelqu'un ait une id\u00e9e ou des suggestions.\n\nSi vous avez des questions je me ferai une joie d'y r\u00e9pondre.\n\nMerci d'avance\n\nNB: D\u00e9sol\u00e9 si la pr\u00e9sentation est chaotique, j'\u00e9cris depuis mon t\u00e9l\u00e9phone."

I realize that this can be subjective, but when a pilot is slurring their speech, botching transponder codes, and forgetting taxiways, would that give a controlling entity grounds to refuse a takeoff clearance (or if airborne, question the pilot)?\n\nI understand it's not ATC's job to verify the physical ability of a pilot, but there have been too many cases of strokes, hypoxia, and CO poisoning where the pilot was unaware of their impairment and slurring their speech, causing accidents which may have been prevented by a denied clearance.

I failed my first PPL checkride; I was my instructor's first student, and my failing mistakes were mainly in exceeding the margin of error for the tested exercises. I blame myself for this, both for not being assertive enough in control, and for deciding to fly the checkride in relatively windy conditions.\n\nI think this is a tough question, because while it's easy to blame lack of preparation on the instructor, an instructor won't send an underprepared student on a checkride. Naturally, it's entirely the student's responsibility to perform the exercises correctly for the DPE, and to cancel the checkride if weather becomes an issue.\n\nI'd be curious to hear an instructor's take on this!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/oqudb0)"

I will admit, it is doubtful that this wish will occur. Sadly, I do not carry skills that an astronaut group would look for. I could also pay to visit our stars, but such a trip would strain a rich man\u2019s bank account, and using my own would obviously not work. Shucks, it looks as if I can only tour cosmic locations vicariously, through astronauts past, and visit historical locations containing astronauts\u2019 tools and transports. \n\nWould any folks in this group also want a trip, away from our galactic birthland?"

It was good for some years, but afterward it felt like a burden to wake up 10 am every Sunday to go to art class and paint a piece each week when I'd already had schoolwork to do. This continued for a few years till COVID struck and I quit drawing altogether. All my paints and tubes were either finished or broken/damaged, no more sketch books in stock, and I didn't have the balls then to ask my dad for a new set of all that. \n\nSo yeah, for the last 3 years I've been nothing but a shell of what I used to be. When school reopened in 2022, I felt happy with actual social contact, but could never feel myself with them. \n\nA week ago, some of my mom's friends came over and one of them gifted me a set of paintbrushes and watercolors. I didn't really care, thought they were cheap \"for kids\" watercolors and mumbled a thanks. \n\nIt's only today I felt motivated by something that i forgot now, but I did a little piece of art on an old diary. And then showed it to my dad. \n\nMy own father, who'd called me a lazy and useless piece of shit for lolling around in my room wasting my life browsing the internet, loved it so much. He was actually transfixed. \n\nAnd that made a small piece of the original me come back alive again. \n\nI've never felt so happy in my life. \n\nI have a personality now. \n\nI have a skill. A skill I'm actually good at. \n\nIt feels so nice."

Found out we have my most important class of the semester together and I can't even type correctly during the course because I can just feel his gaze creeping up on me and I'm paralyzed and want to jump from the window and RUN.\n\nHe still hasn't said a word but I'm too scared to go up to him and confront him. I thought all of this was over but my brain is running in circle. I thought that maybe he went to prison as someone had sued him over something else or at least notified the police and I was interrogated but like most countries our justice system doesn't take sexual abuse seriously enough.\n\nAnd what if I'm just projecting that big mess of emotions over someone that literally has nothing to do with him, that would be so shitty for him but I just can't ! That dude looks like a straight copy paste of that asshole who ruined my high school experience and I hate myself for being THAT disturbed by his presence. I have been a ball of nerve the whole day and hyper alert, I jumped so high when I ran into my poor neighbor that I actually scared her.\n\nI looked up his name to see where he was now and nothing came up, ironically there was two articles on other sexual incidents that took place in our region and one about being in detention but none of those mentions his name so why are they coming up ??\n\nThis vent is already long enough, but please, I hope this is not him."

Something I've found is people hurling at others that you'll offend Aphrodite if you say that you're as pretty as her or prettier. And often when the other person answer that they don't believe in hellenism and hellenistic gods the others will say that it's also disrespectful to them and their belief.\n\nI'm wondering if this sentiment is shared here, and also where did the idea that Aphrodite hates people comparing themselves to her came from, is it from a myth or a piece of ancient greek poetry ? If so I've learned that myths and other literary texts in Ancient Greek are not considered \"canon\", and are regarded as god inspired stories that still hold importance but not always representative of the Gods actual personalities, so where do you draw the line in your practice ?\n\nI'm sorry if I'm not using the correct terminology, I'm pretty new to everything and English isn't my first language, so I don't always know which words I should be using, though I've browsed here a few times and seen you've build a lovely community for yourselves !

I relate so much in so many aspects of your post, I am too very direct, I ask questions, I don't play games either, and I always like to take the initiative, confess my feelings and ask the man out. While in a relationship I also want the man to take the leadership, I don't become soft, as I already am, but I become more romantic and like I do anything I can to make him feel very loved and happy, so in  a way I am softer I guess.\n\nEdit: in my experience, men don't take as intimidating the fact that I take the initiative, like they get very happy when they see a woman finally be the one pursuing them. And the fact that I want them to take the leadership in the relationship, they appreciated it and feel respected, which is what I want them to feel.",

During college, I studied evidence-based practice and I am naturally a person that likes to question and follow the evidence than just accept the mainstream knowledge without researching it properly, because there are lives at risk, and what I could noticed is that for psychiatry the issue is that, firstly, it is bad done \"science\" and second, the neurotoxins that they give to most people, and their treatments have more risks than benefits, so psychiatry isn't like the rest of the other areas of medicine, (even though you can find anywhere this kind of issues when pharmaceuticals do the studies and manipulate data and put the marketing out to increase sells, other times this is not an issue, long convo) but in psychiatry this issue is in their roots, also a failed diagnosis making and understanding of suffering, and unlike other medicine areas where the treatment is based on the benefits being greater than the risks, in psychiatry you find exactly the contrary and a greater toll of deaths caused by the \"treatment\" , and more side effects that cause more issues and chronic mental states, ex. antidepressants can make someone more depressed or suicidal, when studies show that by giving no treatment most people get better with time compared to the ones being treated by psychiatrist, benzos and antipsychotics also create a worsening of symptoms if the \"treatment\" is done for a long period of time, for example benzos shouldn't be taken more than 30 days, even at the 15 days you can make someone worse in their anxiety, good talk therapy would be a better treatment, so I wouldn't recommend to anyone with anxiety to take benzos. Also the basis of antidepressants is an example of bad use of marketing and bad science, just until now people are realizing that the \"serotonin theory\" was a fraud. And I could keep giving more examples. There is good science and good treatments in the medicine field, so it isn't sane to go into conspiracy territory, but questioning bad done science is something that many lack. I don't even personally see psychiatry within the medicine field exactly because of this, they have to fix a lot to be considered evidence-based practice and so to me they don't even do science.",

So the origin theory and treatment proposals are currently on going. On a personal note, I feel like us, the ones with PMDD, are the only ones that truly understand what it is like to live with this and how difficult it truly is.

I honestly can't see myself with an ENxP, given how fast they go through life, it is like they need constant external stimulation and need a partner who loves being clingy. \n\nI don't say this as a negative critic of ENxPs, I think personalities like INFJs match well with them, given that many INFJs want someone to take them out of their shell and are ok with being the clingy one just following their partner along, or if you are an INTJ who is ok with a bubbly extrovert as a partner then is perfect. \n\nBut that's just my experience.",

I loved him.\n\nAfter feeling that way, finally I am free of all those feelings, I can't believe finally I don't love him anymore after all that much love, that after seeing him as the best man I have ever met, I can finally see all his flaws, and who he really is. I don't want to sound mean or judgmental, but seriously now I look at him and I feel like I was so immature back then for liking a man like him, a hypocrite, a very immature man and a womanizer. I am only objectively describing his actions. I was somewhat aware of his flaws but I always thought deep down he has a good heart and I could help him grow as a person and become better, that women were his weakness and so I had to be compassionate and hope he improves... But now I look at him and I think to myself that he is not at all desirable to me, I can't feel love nor admiration anymore, I can't love romantically someone who acts like an hypocrite, and finally I think I can do and deserve better. After all those tears, and waiting faithfully for his eventual return in the future...\n\nI do hope he becomes a better person, for his own well-being, but we are done, in my heart we are finally done.\n\nI am writing this to vent but also to try and give hope, cause I know very well what it feels like you never will be over someone and that you lost the best person ever, your true love.

Idk if this will answer it, or if it's applied correctly tbh, but I think what made this example so impressionable was the contrasting difference between the two decisions I had to decide from. \n\nI spent half of my time in uni trying to pursue a computer science degree and we had a design lab where we basically do projects every week and it would be due by the end of that week it was assigned. Last week of official labs, TA goes around saying as long as you show me you tried for this last lab, I'll give you a passing grade. Deep down I knew I should take up on that offer cause it's the more logical thing to do and since they offered, why not. Why waste your time on the last lab with a high chance of not even finishing when they were gonna give you a passing grade anyway? But I chose not to simply cause I wanted to keep my integrity of the Engineering Code of Conduct thing we signed at the beginning of the semester. \n\nIt just felt morally wrong and I would have taken the free credit if I had my mentality now, but back then I was such a die hard, honest worker who would refuse help. Like, I'd take an L as long as it was my own work. It legitimately was tearing me apart even after it happened. Heck it still haunts me today. \n\nMy friends were like why didn't you take it? Soooo idk if that answers anything?? LMAO but I think you use your dominant function (and see it at work) the best when you have to make such an important decision.",

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s something I need (or worth extra money perhaps), but how helpful was it for those of you who have used it? And what specifically did you use or find the analytics functions helpful for? \n\nJust for some context if you need to understand what I\u2019m asking about: I\u2019m currently interning for an occupational therapy company and I need to make a new website for them to launch their new establishment. So far, they don\u2019t plan to have lines of products to sell online (besides like,  neuropathy socks that are being sold by an individual rather than the company itself). I plan to have videos and images on website for future events/posts and such (and ofc customized domain and ad-free). I was also thinking I could change the plan to accommodate online shopping later on since that idea for the socks is kinda up in the air rn. \n\nPlease let me know what you think or what I should do. Any feedback/ideas on how I could construct this website will be appreciated as well! Thank you very much!"

I also give them nursing report so they are up to speed on their people. \n\nYesterday evening, we had 5 GNAs scheduled for 40 residents. 1 Nurse was given 9 residents.. and they gave me 30 residents with issues and behaviors, and of course, I had a fall last night, too. \n\nI'm a new nurse, and I feel like I drown most nights. When I give that sheet to this specific gna (who I liked and thought we were good friends) , I'm taken back by her sudden annoyance when she responds \"idk, if I get time tonight I might get to it, my cares come first.\" \n\nI felt bad so I tried to get some done and show her I started it and if she can grab the rest or I can try later to do only Temps and pulse ox on a few during med pass. \nShe responds again with an annoyed tone \"yeah that's fine. That's what all the other nurses do.\" \n\nWe have a new guy nurse who's worked LTC for years. I have no idea how he manages to fill that sheet out himself and get everything done. I'm just not that quick skilled wise yet. It's our facility policy that GNAs are required to do that sheet and hand it back to the nurse. I just don't understand why she seemed upset towards me, and I tried to show I would try. \n\nShe gave me the impression that I was handing her more work and that  I just didn't feel like doing? Like, I was pushing it on them even tho I have 'time'to do it? I don't even take a break or have time to eat most nights.. let alone fill those sheets out.\n\nWhat can I do to fix this issue?? What am I doing wrong, and how can I show her she is helping me so much by completing that sheet? BTW she is assigned 8 residents, so I only hand her the sheet for that unit, which has 16 residents.. and another aide who can help her finish up the other 8 on her half.",

They took notice of this right after I gave PRN narc for their mom's severe back pain. This poor woman would never switch positions or readjust herself in bed due to the pain. . I found her leaned to one side of her recliner chair, upper body hanging off the side, bc it would hurt too much to just SIT UP straight or readjust herself in the chair. ANY movement would cause her to grimace terribly in pain. She had several fractures to her lower back, unable to be fixed with surgery. \n\nThe daughter told her neurologist over a video call that her mom was overmedicated. He changed her routine percocet 3 times a day to TYLENOL 650mg twice a day. She still had a PRN percocet but she is so confused she has no idea to ask. I wonder how she can truly heal when she doesn't move due to the pain.",

I cant be too loud either as that feels like uneeded noise. I cant crinkle bags use zippers as it just feels uneeded and if I do I tend to get decently anxious so I just try really hard to avoid making the noise.\n\nSome days (about 20%) I'm not super plauged by this, but some days I cant even cut paper or open a bag of chips during lunch, as that seems too extra. I cant use wood penicls as sharpening them is too loud and same with blowing my nose for some every single day examples. \n\nThis doesn't neccisarrly mean I am scared of making noise, as I can be loud and slam doors and stuff, only when im like p\u00f6aying with my brother or in sotuations where noise doesnt matter. it's only when this noise seems like it may be out of place or extra.\n\nI cant find a name for this anywhere, do any of you know what this is called and how to get over it? It's gotten on my way a fair bit"

I would get Dairoku but I barely see anything about it so it makes me wonder\n\nMy favorites are Nightshade, Collar X Malice, Mystic Messenger, Black Butterfly (basically edgy af otomes lmao) and I did not like Piofiore if that helps. I\u2019m not sure why I just think it was boring. I just like when otome are really emotional and have both fluff moments and make me cry lol\n\n\nI don\u2019t mind if the story isn\u2019t that great I just wanna have a good time and find a new LI to obsess over lmao\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/vpfbx4)"

Bobby was kinda like this, where he was pretty much made for the mc, but he had his own choices and opinions. With Oliver, it\u2019s like the writers were just like \u201cHe\u2019s the best looking so he might as well just be completely perfect so the fans are happy\u201d \n\nThe relationship is moving way too fast and unnaturally too imo.

                "body": "Welcome to the next episode of the series and today we will be calculating the 4D pyramid perimeter, surface area, and you know the rest. Unfortunately, we had to remove the highlight of the formulas in bold because it was causing a mess of star symbols for some weird reason.\n\n# Hypercone\n\nJust like duoprisms, there is also a hyperpyramid that has a spherical base. The perimeter of it is zero because it doesnt have any edges: p = 0\n\nJust like the spherinder we covered in the previous episode, the only surface area on this shape is the one of the base. So the formula is just: S = 4\u03c0r**^(2)**\n\nThe surface volume is more complicated. We of course have the volume of the base sphere, but for the lateral surface, we need to do some research. The unfolded lateral surface area of a cone is essentially a curved 2D pyramid, and the best part is that these types of pyramids work the same as regular pyramids! The circumference of the base (in our case the circumference of the cone) is multiplied by the height or radius of the pyramid (on the cone its the slant length). When we generalize it to 4D, we get a pyramid with a curved base whose area is the surface area of the base sphere. Using the information we found, we can construct the formula: V = \\[(4/3)\u03c0r^(3) *+* (4/3)\u03c0r^(2)\\] \\* l\n\nFor the hypervolume, we are going to look at lower dimensions. The area of a pyramid in 2D is base length \\* half of the height. The volume of a pyramid in 3D is base area \\* third of the height. The fraction of the height in each dimension is 1/number of dimensions. The same rules can be applied for n-cones. So in 4D the formula is: H = (4/3)\u03c0r^(3) \\* h/4\n\n# Non-Spherical Hyperpyramids\n\nThe perimeter of a non-circular pyramid is the base perimeter plus the lateral edge length multiplied by the number of vertices of the base, assuming the pyramid is right. So in 4D, the formula would be:  p = b\u209a + b\u2099e\n\nNow for each edge of the base, there is a triangular face with the base length same as the corresponding edge length and height equal to slant length. Now we add the base to the equation. The formula for the surface area would be: S = b\u209b + b\u209al/2\n\nAgain, the surface volume is the most complicated. Faces can have different shapes now, so this means cells of these faces can be different pyramid snow. However, the shape is still irrelevant and we can calculate the lateral surface area by just multiplying the base surface area by the third of the pyramid height. The pyramid height isn't the same as the slant length l, so we need to give it a new letter. I have decided that we will use t. You know the rest, so here is the formula: V = b\u1d65 + b\u209bt/3\n\nThe hypervolume of the non-spherical hyperpyramid has already been explained in the previous section, so the only thing left is the formula: H= b\u1d65\\*h/4\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWell, this episode is coming to an end. The pyramids will be used to derive the hypervolume of 4D platonic solids, which will be in the next episode, so stay tuned for it!"

Today we will be  measuring the perimeter, surface area, surface volume and hypervolume of  duoprisms, the 4D analogue of prisms.\n\n# Spherinder\n\nThe spherinder is a special duoprism since it has no edges, just like  its 3d analogue, cylinder has no vertices. Since it has no edges, the  formula is just: p = 0\n\nThe surface  area of a spherinder is just the surface area of the 2 base spheres,  since it has no faces on its lateral surface, just like a cylinder  doesn't have any edges on its lateral surfaces. The formula is: S =  2\\*4\u03c0r^(2)\n\nThe surface volume is more complicated. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is the circumference  of the base multiplied by its height h, or slant length l if its  slanted, so by that logic, we can derive that the lateral surface volume  of a spherinder is the surface area of the base multiplied by its 4d  height or slant length. Now we just need to add the volume of the 2 base  spheres. So the formula would be: V = 4\u03c0r^(2)\\*l *+ 2*\\*(4/3)\u03c0r^(3)\n\nFor  hypervolume, we can just take the volume of the base sphere and  multiply it by its 4d height, just like how we can take the area of the  base circle on a cylinder and multiply it by its height. So the formula is: H = (4/3)\u03c0r^(3)\\*h\n\n# Non-Curved Duoprisms\n\nTo calculate the perimeter, we can take the perimeter of the 2  bases and then add the height / slant length multiplied by the number of base sides. So the formula is: **p = 2*****b\u209a + b\u2099*****l**\n\nThe  surface area is a bit more complicated. First, we have the surface area  of the 2 bases. Now, there is a face for each edge of the base. The  first dimension of the face is the height or slant length, just like in  3D. The second dimension is the edge length, also from 3D! The formula  for the lateral surface area could be ah + bh + ch\u2026, however, all these  alphabet letters of edges can be converted into the perimeter of the  base, so the formula is: **S = 2*****b\u209b + b\u209a*****h**\n\nFor  the surface volume, we take a similar approach. We start with the volume of the 2 bases. For each face of the base, there is a cell with a volume of A\u0562*h* (Area of the face \\* height). The formula is: ***V = 2*****b\u1d65 + b\u209b\\*h**\n\nAnd  the hypervolume is pretty straightforward. In 3D, the n-volume of any prism with congruent bases is the base area times the perpendicular height, so we can easily apply it to 4D with base volume instead of base area: **H = b\u1d65\\*h**\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe have  finally reached the end of this episode. This episode took a bit of  brainpower to produce, so we hope you liked it and see you in the next episode!"

                "body": "# Hypercube\n\nA hypercube has 32 edges, so we can easily calculate its perimeter by multiplying the side length by 32. So the formula is: **p = 32\\*a**\n\nWe can also apply the same thing for the faces in order to calculate the surface area. So the formula is: **S = 24\\*a****^(2)**\n\nFor surface volume, we just repeat the same pattern but with 8, the number of cells the hypercube has. The formula is: **V = 8\\*a****^(3)**\n\nThe formula for the area of a square is **a****^(2)** and for the volume of a cube **a****^(3)**. In each dimension, we raise the side length to the power of the number of dimensions in order to get its n-volume, where n is the number of dimensions. So the formula for the hypervolume of a hypercube must be: **H = a****^(4)**\n\n# Hypercuboid\n\nUnfortunately, your hypercube has eaten too much junk food and its now fat. What will you do now to calculate its perimeter, surface area, surface volume and hypervolume? Lets figure it out!\n\nTo get the formula for perimeter, we will look at the lower dimensions. A rectangle has only 2 dimensions, a and b, both of which are in pairs, so the formula is just 2(a+b). A cuboid has a, b and c. The cardinality of the letters is 3, and each letter denotes an edge, so in order to calculate the circumference, we need to multiply the number 3 by x so it gives 12, the amount of edges on a cuboid, and in turn, its whole circumference. And we can easily guess x is 4, so the formula is 4(a+b+c). Now, for the hypercuboid, the cardinality of dimensions is 4. The amount of edges is 32, so we need to find the x for 4\\*x=32. And we can easily solve the x as 8. So the formula for the perimeter of a hypercube is ready: **p = 8\\*(a+b+c+d)**\n\nNow for the surface area, you need to calculate the area for each unique face on the cuboid. There are 6 unique faces: ab, ac, ad, bc, bd, cd. You need to multiply the sum of these faces by 4 in order to get its 24 total faces. The formula is: **S = 4\\*(ab+ac+ad+bc+bd+cd)**\n\nThe formula for the surface volume is similar. You need to multiply the sum of the volumes of unique cells (4) by the number that will get you to its total number of cells (8). We can therefore create the formula: **V = 2\\*(abc+abd+acd+bcd)**\n\nA square has a n-volume of a\\*b, a cube has a n-volume a\\*b\\*c, so for the n-volume (hypervolume) of the hypercube, and according to this pattern, we can just add d to the multiplicative equation and get the formula: H = **a\\*b\\*c\\*d**\n\n# Finale\n\nNow, you know how to measure the hypercuboids and cubes. Thanks for watching the first episode of Perimeter, Surface area, Surface volume, and Hypervolume of 4D Shapes. The 4D shapes that we will measure will (increasingly) get more complex, so get ready! In the second episode, the title of the series will be shortened to *HVSp - Measuring 4D* in order to take up less space."

It\u2019s two alternate spellings of traditional names, which feel deliberate. \n\nSo, based on that, I\u2019ve done a lot of research and reading and though I would share. \n\nThe first is of the story of Lady Godiva. You know, the story of the woman who was forced to ride a horse thru the streets naked, with only her hair to cover her?\n\nWell an Italian opera based on it has this synopsis:\n\n\u201cKing Raimondo tries to find a husband for the princess Isabeau by holding a tournament, but she is unwilling to choose a husband. When the king forces her to ride naked through the city, the people refuse to look at her out of respect. Furthermore, they demand from the king an edict condemning to blindness anyone who dares to look at her. Unaware of the edict, the falconer Folco accidentally looks upon Isabeau during her ride and is arrested. When Isabeau visits him in prison, she falls in love with him and begs her father to pardon him. However, the king's minister stirs up the passions of the people who rise up in a vigilante mob and kill Folco. Isabeau kills herself over his dying body.\u201d\n\nAnd we have heard of a falconer, one we\u2019ve never seen. Jerry, who\u2019s east of Annesburg I believe, not far from where the Princess was last seen.  \n\nAnd one of the unsolved Madam Nazar saying of: \n\u201cI see a ridge in the land\u2026 and a falconer\u2026 and a black smoke rising to the east.\u201d\n\nAnyone have anything to add?

                "body": "For some context, I\u2019m almost 26. I had issues with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and fear. I\u2019m free because I sought deliverance and I wanted to do God\u2019s will over my own will. I forgave and put down my pride.\n\nI come from idolatry. My father's side of the family is buddhist. My mother\u2019s side of the family are catholic. I was born in my hometown. When I was five I moved to my state capital. My older brother of three years older would physically abuse me. Every summer during my childhood, I would go back to my hometown. I would be psychologically abused by my older cousin. I was the youngest one out of three boys. I got molested by a cousin.\u00a0\n\nWhen I was ten, I heard about Jesus. This point in time, I was getting physically abused pretty badly. I would think of hurting myself to get the pain to stop. I wanted to kill myself. I would go to my parents closet and cry. I would ask God if he was real and to let me die. I grew to hate God and believe Jesus is just a fictional character. I was getting sleep paralysis in my dreams.\n\nWhen I was 15, I found \u201cHow he loves us\u201d by David Crowder Band. I could feel the love God has for me. I felt warmth like I was being embraced. My depression got worse to the point, I wanted to commit suicide. I believe during that time I was seeking love and receiving heart break, I was just looking for Jesus.\u00a0I had no will to live and yet I continued on.\n\nMay 2014, I was heartbroken yet again and a former friend prayed for me. I felt the Holy Spirit show me what true joy is. I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior because the only explanation can only be God. A sobbing person can\u2019t start laughing and smiling out of nowhere. I had a vision through my former friend. I saw a wheat field that was not harvested. I saw an angel sow a seed in the ground. I saw the struggle of the seed to grow and eventually that seed bore fruit. I prayed to be in the throne room. I saw my surroundings and saw a body of water. I was standing on water. I saw a hand stretched out. I tried to move and I was sinking trying to grab Jesus\u2019 hand. I was not worthy to be in the throne room. I was not baptized. I prayed for a five fold ministry and being an apostle in the future. I prayed for a church and found one. I felt the Holy Spirit dwelling there. My family did not like that I became a christian and did not follow their beliefs. Satan really binded me to \u201cHonor Thy Parents\u201d. I did not go to church after that.\n\nEventually, I stopped praying and repenting. I saw no reason to pray because I could not stop sinning. That led to self condemnation and shame. I tried to do things on my own over God\u2019s way. I nearly died at the beach in southern California. I went to Disneyland the day before. My legs were sore from standing and walking. I was ready to let the ocean take me away. I believe God allowed me to stay in the same spot because he has anointed me for something. My cousin and older brother helped me. Years later, I attended church again a few times with a family friend\u2019s daughter. I didn\u2019t understand vietnamese as well. I remember I had a dream that I was in the same spot and I couldn\u2019t tell if I was drowning or swimming. I would have dreams of someone chasing me down in order to kill me. I had a dream that I was trying to deliver someone and the demon possessed someone else and tied me to the table. I kept trying to pray before the demon tried to stab me in the heart. When the demon was very close to stabbing my chest. I rebuked that demon in the name of Jesus. I woke up.\n\nAt the end of March, I moved out. I was being spiritually oppressed while living with my parents. I felt trapped, no say, not standing, and scared. I moved out and lived with my cousin and his girlfriend. It was another spiritually oppressing place. I tried to change my ways. It was just a toxic environment. I prayed, listened to the word, and worshipped during work. I started driving again. I was scared and very anxious. I almost got into a car accident on three days before I got baptized. I almost hit a truck. I needed prayer and I came across Cleveland Street Preachers on youtube streaming. I called in to get prayer. Brother Joe told me I needed deliverance. So I watched Isaiah Salvidar on deliverance. I felt the demons inside me manifest. I was nauseous at work. My friend Erica was helping me find a church that does deliverance. I got kicked out of my cousin\u2019s house. I did not want to go back to live with my parents. I almost did not get baptized. I fought to get baptized. I did not want to wait anymore. I almost waited seven years, how much longer did I need to wait? My older cousin took me to get baptized and deliverance. Someone mentioned to me that the city I grew up in are hungering for Jesus. At that moment, I understood why I was moving back with my parents.\n\nSatan did not want me to have a prayer life. Prayer is a our authority. He did not want me to move. He did not want me to get baptized and delivered because he\u2019s scared of God\u2019s destiny for me. I know that the lack of knowledge in the word is the reason why I was spiritually oppressed. I understood another reason why I had to move back with my parents. If I lived with my cousin and his girlfriend, I wouldn\u2019t have kept my deliverance."

It was very strained and I couldn\u2019t stand his presence until September 2019. \n\nI\u2019ll explain why it was strained. I\u2019ve known him for 6 years. I spent half that time running away from him. I have a bad childhood and traumas. He read me like a book and that scared me. I ghosted him for two months after I asked him out of curiosity what can he tell about me as a person. I don\u2019t like to be vulnerable. I would get angry at him because he would purposefully give me bad advice because he knew I wouldn\u2019t listen to the good advice. Once I realized he did that last year before we made up. I refuse to talk to him. \n\nI remember that we made up before my birthday in September. I told him how much he meant to me. I cared about him and lot and he was someone who understood me the best. He kept trying to be my friend when I didn\u2019t want to anymore. He\u2019s such a kind person.\n\nI talked to him two weeks before he passed away. We got on Facebook messenger and went on cam. We played unto as a 4 man group. I saw how tired he was and I asked him if he was okay. He said I\u2019m fine. \n\nHe has insomnia, depression, and very hilarious humor. He always believed in me to grasp my own happiness when I couldn\u2019t see it. He said a lot of stuff that was funny. He said that he missed being a fuckboy and he\u2019s a retired thot. He told me how his apartment got broken into and they stole his electronics and they took a shit and didn\u2019t flush the toilet.\n\nI just regret how I wasn\u2019t a good friend to him and I didn\u2019t spend enough time with him. When I heard the news I couldn\u2019t believe and my friends were asking things about him and I broke down. I dreamt about him twice. First time was denial and after his birthday. He was going to be 28. \n\nI\u2019m not ready for a year without him. I\u2019m not ready to move on from this year. I\u2019m not ready for the day he passed away. I\u2019m not ready for his birthday.

I\u2019ve noticed the sign of an immature guys at the age of 25. I was dating a guy a year younger than me. I had a inkling that he was trying to tie me down because I gave him the time of day. A month of dating my ex broke up with me. Tell me how much he loves me and ghosting me. I end up meeting that incel after two days of my ex dumping me. My long time friend passed away 9 months ago. My ex uses me yet again after claiming he would be there for me and ghost me. He bought me stuff to lessen his guilt.\n\nI ended up seeing a 26 year old garbage. He played me for 8 months. I was fed up with him before he ended thing. We were never official. He took advantage of me. We did lot of couple things. The only reason why I couldn\u2019t see the red flags was because my friend passed. I held onto an unrealistic dream that he planted in my mind. He would knock down my self esteem to keep me at his level. He claimed a lot of women wanted him to make me jealous. He was playing chess over me. He treated me like I was a dog to other people behind my back. I did feel like I was treated like a dog. I felt like a dog that gets excited after their owner gives them affection after coming home from work. He clearly was seeing behind people my back and never wanted to lose the attention and affection I gave him. One day though, I had called him out for being shitty before he was telling me to let\u2019s stay friends. He wanted to do stuff with another girl when I got the impression we were exclusive. I told him if you like and care about me you would have declined them over contemplating and telling me. He tried to do a power move and ended things. \n\nAfter things ended, everything I was sad about crash down. I wasn\u2019t sad over him ending things. I was sad about my life because I don\u2019t have my life together. I wanted to kill myself because every problem I felt I have couldn\u2019t be solved. The whole time I wanted to kill myself, the incel wasn\u2019t the person I thought about. I thought about my older brother and eventually I called him explain how I wanted to kill myself. I told the incel what happened and then I found out the truth about him. I realized how shitty he is after that.\n\nI wanted to believe that the person who told me the truth was lying and I believed the incel. The reason why I did was because I spoke so highly of him and that meant that I had poor judgement and a fool. He ended things because he wanted to control me. He tried to control me when I was seeing him. I knew he was seeing someone else. I was waiting for him to tell me. When he told me a week after he ended things that he was seeing an 18 year old. I went off on him. His new squeeze tried to defend him. She said \u201cif you don\u2019t care that he\u2019s seeing me, why are you angry?\u201d I aggressively said \u201cbitch stfu, I\u2019m talking to him\u201d. I was grilling him for answers. He was too scared to answer me. He told her and I if we wanted him to stop talking to one of us that he would do it.\n\nHe tried to force me to be his friend through multiple excuses. So I talked mad shit about him on discord. He talked to a 14 year old in dm call. He got kicked from the server. I explained to people in a server who knew and don\u2019t even like him how shitty of a person he is. There was no group bullying. I told him don\u2019t even talk to me. I join a server call greeted everyone but him. He realized I ignored him and said I made him look like an idiot when he was doing it long before I ignored him. \n\nI still talk to him out of being petty. I\u2019m only petty when karma gets to them. I talk to him still to see how badly he will fuck himself over. How shitty do you have to be for your own age group doesn\u2019t even want to date you that you have to groom someone to like you. He is really fake. I joined a server call. He was in it and he deepened his voice and talked slower to sound methodical. Has no personality.\n\nHonestly, I forgot why I\u2019m pissed until someone asked about us as a couple and I had to explain why it didn\u2019t work and how he fucked me over. How miserable do you have to be this shitty of a person with no redeeming qualities. He needs to pick a struggle. He can\u2019t be balding, momma\u2019s boy, fuckboi, incel, simp, coward, fake ass bitch, or pedo. Every time he talks to me I don\u2019t believe anything he says and I\u2019ll passive aggressively rub salt into his wounds by showing him I don\u2019t need him. I hate him so much if he killed himself I wouldn\u2019t bat an eye. I\u2019m not even sad over him I\u2019m so angry he wasted my time. I simply can\u2019t get over it because I saw him as someone I wanted to spend my life with. He lied to me the whole time leading me on acting like he wanted a future with me then act like I created a whole fantasy. \n\nIt was my fault I got played and it understandably because my friend passed away. I couldn\u2019t see the signs."

Mandarin? A touch of it was there.       \n\nSubtle, but...He saw why she picked this particular shower gel.        \nOn the tip of his tongue it remained.       \nSo to speak, for now.        \n\n\n\n\"Spill it, Shy boy\" - Izanami's gentle voice teased.      \n\nThe stakes were high.        \n\n\n\"Definitely mango. And, err...\".        \n\nIf he guessed correctly, a month of strip D&D was promised, with HIS storyline included.     \nAnd if he was wrong...       \n\n\n\"That was the easiest one. Correct! And?\"\n\" Something faintly citrusey...\" He continued.  \"Perhaps, lime?\".        \n\n\n\"WRONG\" - The beauty lifted herself up from the silken sheets. Moments before, her unclothed bum had been in his rather happy face. He had held both cheeks open, prying his nose in between them to get a better whiff.       \n\n\"It was yuzu. Do better next time, Shy boy\". She winked at him.      \n\n\n\"Uh oh. Looks like i won.\" She put on a face.         \n\n\n\nHe pretended to look disappointed, but not for very long.       \n\n\"I really should've known, huh?\".     \n\n\nHe took her in his arms.     \n\"Looks like you did, Izzy. That means you can go get the ropes!\" He let go of her, giving her very clean bum a little push.       \n\nUpon finding the ropes, she hurriedly put herself in a harness. So quickly she could wrap them around her! How gorgeous her body looked, put on display like this. Her face was radiant, lit up by a cheeky smile.       \n\n\nShylock took in the sight, enjoyed another deep breath, relaxed his shoulders, and quickly plunged his left arm deeply inside of his gasping girl,\nHolding her steady with his right.        \n\n\nHe always did prefer win-win situations"

I whined and groaned through every lesson but went along with it. As soon as I could, i stopped doing the lessons with her. This was mainly due to me being an immature child and not wanting my precious time playing with toys or on the computer taken away from me. \n   I\u2019m a teenager now, and while i was listening to Ryuchi Sakamoto\u2019s \u201cThousand knives\u201d I was reminded of her. Looking back, i wish i stayed in piano. I was always jealous of my older sister who was seemingly perfect, and who i viewed as a prodigy in anything to do with art or music. That resentment built up to me refusing to learn anything to do with piano. \n  Thankfully I don\u2019t have that mindset anymore, (me and my sister are chill) and i\u2019ve recently wanted to get back into piano. By now i\u2019ve most likely forgotten most of the basics except for the notes, and i\u2019ll need to work on my coordination to get to the point where i can play a piece successfully. \n  I\u2019ve been stressed recently, having a lot of breakdowns and such, and i\u2019ve tried to \u201csuck it up\u201d and \u201cbe a man\u201d but i think that i\u2019m going to allow myself to express how i feel more often. My sister will be leaving for college soon, and I\u2019ve been stressing over various personal matters in my life.   I\u2019ve never been good with talking or letting out my emotions in a more healthy way, so hopefully learning piano again will help. \n  My end goal is to play the song mentioned earlier, \u201cThousand knives\u201d by Ryuchi Sakamoto."

                "body": "Usually I don't have very vivid dreams, and most of the time they're just misplaced memories and stuff, but last night was unique in comparison.\n\n\\---\n\nI've been having a lot of deja-vu lately, and I've noticed that it has also translated into my dreams, as a lot of the settings have been familiar to me - like I've been there before in my dreams, per se. Anyways, I was trying to get into this facility with another girl who was also trying to get in, and while we were trying to get in, a security guard caught us and took the girl into the facility. He yelled at me and taunted me, and I attempted to run away but I ended up falling down a hill and like just, I guess getting caught by him? Because I remember just magically appearing inside the facility, lol. Anyways, I was there in the facility, and we were sitting in front of this window, just against the wall, looking to the outside. It was just teenage girls, some sitting there with orange plastic-looking suits, and I knew some of them from my real life. And then the overseer came in, who was Gwyneth Paltrow in a lab-coat and heels, and she was holding a clipboard as well. So I was just seated onto the long benches next to the other girls, and it seems that because I wasn't wearing an orange suit, I was singled out. The girl who was trying to get into the facility with me began to make fun of me, and so did the other girls. \n\nBut then I began to actually fight back, and I started to yell back at them and hit them, and in return they wouldn't do anything, just glare at me. Then Gwyneth Paltrow began to talk about her expectations of us as residents of the facility, but as she was talking, I noticed there was like a smoke flare in the distance behind her. I began to laugh, like hysterically, and then an evacuation alert began to blare in the facility, and she made us wear orange coats for some reason, to protect us from the blast, I guess? \n\nSo I just followed the rest of the girls through this labyrinth of a facility, filled with machines and tech that you would expect to see in like a sci-fi film in the seventies. I stopped in my tracks, and then the bomb went off and we were all blasted into the sky, and I remember seeing everyone looking down at the earth, covering their faces with their coats, and the clouds were just swirling all around us as we all fell to our deaths. \n\nHowever, I acquired a para-glider, and I just flew to this island off the coast of Florida, and decided to stay there for a little bit. I landed there and walked around the island, noticing the locals staring at me. I wanted to go back home so I could check on my family, and see if they were affected by the blast. And plus, I was lonely and anxious being alone on the island, even if it was beautiful and foreign. \n\nSo I flew back home, and I was in my house, and I remember seeing my brother in the garage of the house, and just looking outside. I noticed that everything appeared normal, but the grass and trees had all turned a light green, and everything was windy. I told my brother to get inside in case of radiation from the bomb, and he said it was fine. I looked up at the sky, and it was a whirlwind of clouds, the sun shining through the funnel of clouds, with star-trails surrounding the sun, just spinning rapidly. It was all disorienting, so I went back inside. \n\nI was planning on leaving home to go and explore the world with my para-glider, so I went into my room to pack, and inside was just my dresser, but huge and it didn't have any knobs on the drawers for some reason? But as I was packing, I remember just like suddenly stopping, and my eyes glossing over. A voice spoke to me, and showed me this image of the stars, and said something to me very quietly and I can't remember what it was trying to convey to me, I just blinked my eyes and slung my bag over my shoulder and went to go say my goodbyes. \n\nMy aunt was there, and she hugged me and cried when I told her I was leaving. The reality of it all hit me, and I began to worry about all the relationships and commitments that tied me to my home. I worried about money, and other things, even though when I had flown to that island, I felt like I didn't have to worry about those sort of things. But I cried to her, and I remember deciding to stay for a little longer and then my dream ended there.\n\nIt was all very disorienting, but I noticed that that usually happens whenever I dream. \n\nAnyways, if you got to the end of this, I hope you aren't too confused, and semi-enjoyed this recount."

I am not responsible for any damage. \n\nSo to start with, I have an old mediocre laptop and I dont really care about it much. I simply mess around with stuff on it, run tests like these. I was looking for ways to boost my fps, and I thought it might be worth sharing this with y'all, found this cool free app named Razer cortex and ran several different settings with starsector. What I observed was that Razer did not boost fps directly but it did allow me to allocate more VRAM. I used as many mods I could with max battles size, ran every test at least 3 times and got this on benchmark test of starsector \n\nWithout Razer - 5gb : 11 fps, 5.5gb : 14fps, 6gb : 12 fps, 6.5gb :9 fps, 7gb : 9 fps\n\nI did not think it was wiser to go higher, at 7 gigs the game crashed. \n\nWith Razer - 5gb : 12 fps, 5.5gb : 15 fps, 6gb : 18fps, 6.5gb : 20fps, 7gb : 23 fps, 7.5gb : 18fps\n\nI also saw that turning on air conditioning in room gave about 2fps more, defragging the disk if you have lots of mods installed another 2-3fps (Although I am not sure if the defragging actually did anything at all, because it shouldnt have done anything other than speeding up saves and loads. It might have been result of a cooler environment) \n\nConclusion : Razer turned on and with another 1.5 gigs allocated to starsector combined with defragging and air conditioning, I got a grand total of...... 28 fps. I know its not much, but it is something, 14 fps more than nothing. From not playable at all to barely playable. \n\nThere are several factors that might change your experience. If you never change your startup settings, or any settings at all, so that apps like steam and discord auto start, you might gain another 5-10 fps. If you have already overclocked your rig to max performance, turned off all auto startups, there isnt much Razer can do. Also the amount of apps you use in background heavily affects the fps you can manage to pull. \n\nLastly, I saw a heavy game startup lag with Razer on. It took about 30-40 seconds more to load the game, although the overall experience is much smoother. \n\nThats all I can think for now, if I find anything else I will add edits to this post."

Plus every other fleet has an onslaught or legion, which makes the station look like a joke. \n\n\nThese tiny things with like 5 guns arent even lore friendly, these structures are supposed to hold millions of people and every other fleet that can manage to run a broken onslaught just comes and shits on them?  It doesnt make sense when nexerelin launches 10 invasion fleets with 5 capital each against a size 4 colony with an orbital station that can barely defend against a weak pirate raid. \n\n\nWhat I mean to say is, the station system needs a massive buff. And by massive I mean the last level star fortress should require something like 10-15 paragons deployed (of course not at once, that would break the game) to destroy, or make the capital ships much much rare, that coming by a paragon should be same as coming by a cryosleeper, or make it at least like 5 million creds to own a capital ship. \n\n\nMake it a game setting, where player can choose personally how hard it is to come by higher tier ships. And just dont give every other hegemony patrol fleet an onslaught, this is the apocalypse and people dont even have enough food. \n\n\ntldr: stations too weak, ships too strong and easy to come by. Buff up the station or nerf the ships."

                "body": "A lot of players seem to be struggling with AI in combat, so I decided to leave whatever I've learned here. How to get AI to do better and how you can help. I might be wrong and I definitely dont have all the best tips, so correct me and drop your tips down :) I wont include things everyone know like officers and commands. \n\n1) AI is often bad with custom weapon sets. Even a good ship with good weapons is useless if AI doesnt use it right. In such cases use preset weapons and upgrade to similar weapons. For example if preset gives you a graviton beam and you have flux and OP to spare, use an Ion beam. But not a different type or range, such as pulse laser (range is really really important) This doesnt apply always, for example swapping a pd with lr pd is almost always good (IMO dont @ for this), so you have to play around a bit. \n\n2) Similar ranged and roles weapon sets. It is not advisable to put both super long and super short ranged weapons on same ship, especially if both of them are offensive (pd doesn't count) the ship will try to get the antimatter blaster in range even if it doesn't have flux to spare, or a gauss cannon that is doing its job perfectly. Assign roles, such as short ranged assault, long ranged standoff support. It'll help. And make sure you couple similar damage type weapon to same key. All hellbore to key 1,or all gauss and HVD to key 4 (similar and same, but dont put wildly different weapons together)\n\n3) Some ships really suck in hands of AI accept that. Auroras, gryphons, wolf (p)  although extremely strong ships, wont work anything special wih AI. Dont waste time making it work if you cant. Ditch them or pilot them yourself. \n\n4) A lot of times in thick of battles you'll see your beloved  tempest getting mauled while you sit inside fortress shield of your paragaon. If your own ship is safe, and you really want to save the other ship, transfer command to it. Yep that's it. Pause, give whatever commands you feel are necessary and transfer command to it. You can often save it. Then you go back to your own ship. \n\n5) Complimentary fleets. It is good to have variety of roles in your fleet, but ships that are too different wont work very well together. This especially happens in mid game fleets. If you try to pair a dominator and a doom it wont work all that well. But if you rather had an apogee and a doom..... \n\n6) Love D mods. Especially in early game with little choices, choose a wildly broken good ship over a pristine bad ship. A Broken onslaught can bring much more to battlefield than a pristine dominator. \n\n7) A lot, and I mean a lot of players ignore this. You dont always have to pilot the strongest ship. Sure, you can sit in the mighty onslaught and wreak havoc, but at the end you'll see your side lost ships too. To prevent that, use a more agile, strong but agile ship as flagship. Let the onslaught do its thing, transfer to a doom or harbinger and go save that lonely hammerhead being mauled by three medusas. Remember, above all the key is not your flagship, its you. Your ship is not that fast, but your command shuttle is. You are powerful, not the ship. Learn to move around and transfer command, dont just sit and let it happen. (I know I repeated this point twice. What I mean to say is, transferring command is really useful. Pretty useful for saving ships yeah, but also for applying pressure on key points.) \n\nWatch, learn and make your own tactics. With time you'll learn where to exactly hit the shepherd to turn it into a merry go round, or lock the mighty doom in a losing flux battle with an average hammerhead. Watch the battlefield. You'll learn."

I'm quite sure I'm a fairly high tenor, somewhere between a lyric spinto and a leggiero (my first passaggio is D4/Eb4 and second is G#4/A4). I've been undergoing lessons for a bit over a year, my teacher hasn't classified my voice because she prefers to get technique solid first.\n\nI went to see an ENT in June this year to have a vocal examination as I felt like I had excessive phlegm build up on my voice way too often (even with proper hydration). What my ENT told me is that my vocal health is excellent and there is nothing wrong with my larynx, the only thing that he thought of that could cause the sensation of phlegm build up was minor LPR (laryngopharyngeal reflux).\n\nHe also noted that I have gargantuan tonsils (Grade 4) and that I have a badly deviated septum which also causes enlarged inferior turbinates, basically he told me my upper airways in general are quite obstructed. He sent me to a sleep physician who diagnosed me with obstructive sleep apnoea due to my tonsils and septum, so now I've booked in for a septoplasty and tonsillectomy in March next year.\n\nHow will this affect my middle register in particular? I've always had trouble with placement in that area so I can only really use a twangy heady mix above F4. Will I be able to manage airflow better without obstructions in the nose and pharynx?"

                "body": "Hi there,\n\nOnce again, let me lead by saying this is my favourite CCG and favourite mobile game.\n\nI have been playing heavily during lockdown, averaging 3 sets of challenges a day, focusing on Blue and Black decks (which are all I play on paper and heavily prefer in other digital Magic). I believe 40% of my games are against AI, so my rating is, of course, inflated, currently at 6.2k\n\nSo, some more thoughts so far.\n\n*Rewards, F2P, Shop*\nWeekly chests and daily challenges are a fantastic play and reward incentive, exactly as they are. However, the daily shop feels like it is missing a mid-range, reliable goldsink of some description; perhaps a shop restock button? Perhaps the booster that can be purchased with gold should have a faster refresh, maybe in line with challenges?\n\nHowever, I'm quibbling.\nI'd like to reiterate that daily challenges and weekly chests are perfectly generous as they are.\n\nI have probably spent \u00a360+, and have pretty much completed gathering a full set of Blue and Black with incidentally enough to play competitive decks of all Planeswalkers. This isn't too bad, considering Magic is always an expensive hobby.\n\n*Community*\nYes, there's a Discord, but for most players of any game, communities form first in-game. I think it goes without saying that we're looking forward to testing advances here. I'd again like to see something like a greetings or well-played emote or emoticon, even if it's a one-use-per-game, just to help avoid the feeling that starting -every- game is against AI. Yes you quickly tell by name, deck style, play speed and tactical choices, but it is a very sterile experience at the moment.\n\n*Performance and Critical bugs*\nLatency issues can occur from time to time, which if themselves would be fine, however there appear to be related synchronisation bugs with the UI. This causes critical gameplay issues.\nHowever, far more seriously, there is a devastating frequency to game kick-outs, freezes, match shutdowns and a very frustrating bug where mana does not refill at the start of turn. One can only hope these issues are the absolute priority to the exclusion of other additions and improvements, as they will otherwise prevent any significant growth or sustained interest in the game if not permanently and perfectly eliminated. This can't be overstated.\n\n*Balance*\nThere are a few cards which are dominant to extreme, but I hesitate to waste anyone's breath or attention on discussing a low priority issue. If the game released fully, all bugs addressed, there would be little to complain about, as these would be easily fixed by both future card additions, a few small mana cost increases, and very little else. Therefore, job well done\n\n*Art and UI*\nNo serious complaints. In fact, much could afford to be sacrificed if it helped with performance. Screen refreshes and transitions when filtering and switching between decks are a little slow, at least on Galaxy S7 Android.\n\nReally got my fingers crossed for Spellslingers, keep up the good work!"

                "body": "First things first, you've knocked this almost perfectly out of the park. Great work.\n\nThe game is pitched just right in terms of balancing casual digital-first CCG capability, like card generation and randomness smoothing, and being true to M:tG. It's polished, and the free to play aspect is also just about right, enticing and rewarding. Cost-wise, I'm impressed. It's just not quite too greedy. :)\n\nFeedback and suggestions for success and longevity:\n\n1. The card pool will need to grow to balance the heroes and their assorted typical strategies. However, this is probably better done with a drip-feed of small numbers of cards over time, rather than opting for expansions and rotations.\n\n2. The starter decks and planeswalker unlocking feel rewarding and well-paced.\n\n3. Lands and mana choices are generally well done.\n\n4. There is no need for new heroes (unless perhaps a colourless Karn/ Ugin style, or tri, quad and omni), but there is a space for the concept of a variation of the Planeswalker card.\nThese could be different prints of the respective hero, inspired by the different versions in paper, and function similarly to land card in the deck building stage, then interacting like an artifact in game. There need not be many printed: 3/4 ever for each planewalker seems sufficient. Here, the general idea is to utilise that Planeswalker design space to provide a cheap, active, repeatable, visible and weak hero power mechanic that has proven very successful in a certain other digital CCG about fireside rocks or something. This would be highly popular, and not add much complexity.\n\nFor example, you are making a Jace deck. In addition to his signature power, you may add the planeswalker card Jace, Illusionist. This gives you the 2 mana ability to summon a 0/2 flying illusion, once per turn. You may instead prefer to include the planeswalker card Jace, Architect, which grants the ability to reduces the power of a creature by 1 for 2 mana, again, always once per turn.\n\nYou get the general idea.\n\n5. The disconnects, crashss etc. are a little prohibitive, but I imagine you are well aware.\n\n6. The 'arena flyover' cut before the planeswalker introduction is repetitive and doesn't appear to add much over the load screen. If cutting this would help performance load even slightly, I doubt any would notice the absence.\n\n7. While a low priority to my mind, the possibility of alternate game modes of various descriptions would sustain interest over the long-term.\n\n8. A minor degree of social features, such as minimalist 'greetings' and 'well played' emotes, are a much bigger draw than they may first appear.\n\nBut keep up the great work guys, not often a game passes my personal standards for quality. You should be proud."

The others have flaws too, but their flaws weren't that annoying because there should be a different situation for their flaws to look annoying. This show was about rules, and she doesnt like rules, so she looked annoying.\nOthers WOULDVE looked annoying if the show was about something else...\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk (which doesn't make sense now that I read through it)",

I have trouble making friends and it's really disappointing when I find someone that I can share my thoughts with and they dismiss it like that. I don't think my thoughts are so bad to be deemed as hallucinatory. They are quite realistic, and practical questions/views.\n\nThis has happened about 4-5 times now which makes me question if I should share my thoughts with others at all. What if these thoughts are controversial or a taboo breaking some sort of a social code. My idea of a conversation is clearly different from most people as I like to talk about why people behave the way they do. Not the person I'm talking to, but things like why are people so addicted to TikTok or why does small talk exist etc. I'm not a diagnosed aspie, but I'm waiting for the assessment. \n\nInterested to know if others get asked this question too."

I see these people in places other than *fun* social situations where they should be able to express their opinions freely and not need a safety net of \"being dumb\" to fall on. Most of these women are quite smart but superficial. They would start making a statement without mentioning the source or any fact. The statement would be potentially valid if they mentioned the source or delved deep into the matter providing some insight to their audience. Then they end their statement with \"I don't know, maybe I'm just being dumb\" or \"I am dumb\". I don't undertsand the basis of calling yourself dumb in front of others. Why do they deem it necessary to say it out loud? What's more strange is I never see guys acting this way. I was wondering if anyone else noticed this as well or maybe they would like to expand more on it. I don't like being a know-it-all in a group and there are times when I don't know things however, the thought of calling myself dumb never crosses my mind in those situations."

                "body": "Hey guys, this post is kinda sad just a heads up but I'm looking for alternative advice. \n\nSo we have two English Shepards, male and female, and the female is pregnant, due at the end of July. We are already intending to keep a girl because the mom is older (this is her 4th litter). The dad is younger but has always been a little neurotic and fear reactive. He will often hide in his crate and not come when called. She is the alpha dog and he's fairly beta but he's gotten into several severe fights with the female over the years (last was 2.5 years ago). We had to rehome another dog back in 2015 for this as well (fighting/unable to accept betaship). \n\nThis week, he fought the female again and wouldn't relent, it took my mom over 15 minutes chasing them around the yard with the hose to break them up. Last night when my mom was trying to pill him, he bit her (she's the Alpha, big problem for sundry reason obviously). She said she was ready, both when they were fighting and right after he bit her, to put him down, because she can't trust him, he won't always listen to command, and two of his sons over the last 3 years have been put down for similar aggressive/erratic behavior. \n\nI want to try to find another way to solve this, but neutering won't necessarily do it because one of the sons was neutered, we can't get him neutered for another month, and at minimum that would solve the aggression but not the reactivity/refusal of commands. My mom is uncomfortable having a dog she can't trust in the house, but we've already been through so much this year with quarantine I don't want to add this on top of everything for my siblings if I can help it. \n\nUnfortunately there's also money to consider, which is pretty tight right now as it is for a lot of people, the medical bills were already a lot, neutering would be more, and I don't know if we have enough for a professional trainer, which I've seen given as advice before for dogs with reactivity problems.\n\nSo I'm looking for any other option here, and there might not be one, but I needed to try for my conscience. If anyone has any advice, I am nothing but big floppy ears."

Off-center part. It's pretty boring; are there alternatives?\n\nAnd as for styling, I usually wear my hair up, with \"wings\" twisted away from my face and a bun or tuck in back. Braid crowns sometimes. My hair is generally too thin for some up/some down, ponytails, and braids. Completely slicked back hair is awkward.\n\nI would like to wear it down more often, but I'm not sure how to do it. Straight is too flat and severe, mermaid waves are a bit too much, 50's style curls like I used to do seem too \"little girly\", and bend at just the ends seems to fall out easily.

Sophia Loren and Sofia Vergara, two prototypical SD's, do have that body type, but my argument is that not every SD does, and that might confuse people.\n\nNow, I get that long limbs and vertical are necessary for SD, period. But I also think that you can be SD and have either an 8 body shape (as described [here](https://insideoutstyleblog.com/2009/04/body-shapes-explained-figure-8-shape.html), but basically with shorter waist, shelf hips, and the widest point at the hips) OR an X shape (outlined [here](https://insideoutstyleblog.com/2010/05/real-life-body-shapes-x.html), with a longer, but still curvy waist, a longer \"rise\" from the waist's smallest point to the bottom of the crotch, widest point on lower hips/upper thighs). \n\nIf you look at bathing suit shots, Rihanna and Ava Gardner (weren't both of them originally verified TR's before being changed?) both have closer to an X shape, with slightly shorter legs. Even though I think their legs \\*look\\* long in the right outfits, and they still have vertical, but as someone with an X body shape who probably is also an SD, I just wanted to point this out and see if anyone agrees or disagrees."

Therefore I'm recalibrating and trying to figure out what in my wardrobe to keep and how to make those items work.\n\nI love wearing dresses, but find it difficult to make longer silhouettes not feel overly formal at work. I also have an extremely hard time finding jumpsuits, because I have a long waist/shorter legs and therefore a long rise/crotch that doesn't work with most of them. Flared trousers are also currently a challenge, as many of the ones I can find are too long, and then don't flare enough if hemmed.\n\nSo my main question is how to do separates, especially in a late 50s/60s style that is stereotypically interpreted as Classic/Gamine, in a flattering SD way. I love Brigitte Bardot, Audrey Hepburn, Catherine Deneuve, and Jane Fonda style, with the high-waisted, tapered trousers, circle skirts, sweaters, ballet flats, etc, [like so](https://www.pinterest.com/sarahmariev/aesthetic-beatnik-ballerina/). I also love the 90s reinterpretation of the look, too, sort of the [school girl/cottage core/whimsigoth](https://www.pinterest.com/sarahmariev/aesthetic-softcorewhimsigoth/) look, with jumpers, turtlenecks, boots, and miniskirts. \n\nUnfortunately, those kinds of outfits aren't what are usually outlined in SD guides, and I'm struggling to brainstorm what might work. I've found that adding sheer tights that match a shorter mini-skirt can  help, I mostly try to wear tapered shoes, and I wear head-to-toe \"looks\" that match or have repeating colors/similar tones. Longer, midi skirts that are more circle cut and not A-line are great, and I personally love turtlenecks. I also personally think that some subtle pleating in trousers and skirts really flatters. \n\nI also am a Soft Summer, and although I do cheat with black, I try to stick to blues/greys/burgundy/creams, which sometimes can be more difficult to wear as a monochrome look. If it helps, I also have Classic and Ethereal essences, and I love to sneak in little hints of playful Ingenue as well (although I tend to miss the mark and end up too cutesy if I'm not careful!)\n\nAny tips are greatly appreciated :)"

                "body": "I wonder if anyone else feels the way that I do: Ethereal essence is so much abstracted (as all types are, but it seems much more so) that people often mistake it for something else, or vice versa. It's not properly identified, especially apart from other Essences blended in. \n\nFor example, I think a ton of people mistake Ethereal for Dramatic or Dramatic Ethereal. Tilda Swinton and Cate Blanchett are almost always used as the prime examples for Ethereal, but they have Dramatic as well, which gives them the more sleek \"otherwordly\" or \"alien\" look. Natural is also often lumped into Ethereal, with the more mermaid versions of the aesthetic. There is similarity between Romantic and Ethereal that I myself have mixed up (I suit details like ruching, gathers, etc, even though I have no Romantic), as Ethereal is Yin, and it still has a slightly rounded, flowing feel. There's also often an innocence or softness to Ethereal that people mistake for Ingenue. The most helpful thing for me has been eking out what Ethereal is apart from the other factors, even though it's almost never \"pure\" in anyone's blend.\n\nIt also stinks that the way Ethereal is described makes it feel impossible for people to incorporate it into everyday looks. Rachel at TiB has a helpful post with some of this info, and I do think that The Concept Wardrobe's treatment is nice, but both tend to emphasize the \"otherworldly\" elements without describing how they can be translated. For example, S shapes, tear drops/long ovals (in necklines, jewelry), flares or tapers, wing shapes and braids (especially in hairstyles), diffuse colors/fabrics that have sheen without hard shine (chiffon, fine glitter or sequins, burnished metallic, suede, fur, silk, brushed satin, cashmere), filigree, cutouts, etc. \n\nYou can always incorporate small amounts of these different details for the effect. I'm EC, and today I'm wearing a medium length knit sweater with braid detailing, high waist bell bottom jeans, almond toe boots, chandelier earrings, a necklace with a teardrop pendant, a crown braid hairstyle, and soft cat eye glasses with delicate metal frames. I'd love to hear what other more casual looks fellow Ethereal blends have put together, as well.\n\nThe Ethereal document I'm working on: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLOKcUZZ0IoGTIpJouJ20MPVYXt-hnN\\_VXTzDxQTzU8/edit?usp=drivesdk](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLOKcUZZ0IoGTIpJouJ20MPVYXt-hnN_VXTzDxQTzU8/edit?usp=drivesdk)\n\nAnd my Pinterest board with casual looks (ignore the Romantic part, they actually probably lean EC): [https://www.pinterest.com/sarahmariev/ethereal-romantic-casual/](https://www.pinterest.com/sarahmariev/ethereal-romantic-casual/)"

It's elderflower liqueur, but it has fruity notes in its bouquet, and different reviews have mentioned lychee, guava, grapefruit, pear, passionfruit, and peach. A lot of reviews mention its \"nectar\" quality as well. I know about **SS** ***Gin Flower*** (*Osmanthus, Elderflower, Apricot, Vanilla, Juniper, Lime, Manuka Honey Accord (Vegan), Pear, Citron, Hawaiian Sandalwood*), but I don't want juniper, and I'm gun shy about honey, especially from SS (it smells like grape laffy taffy, every time lol).\n\nI commissioned a custom from Fandom (rave reviews: she was so responsive and fast and just all around lovely) with the following notes:\n\nTop: Grapefruit, elderflower, a little peach\n\nMiddle: ginger amber, aldehyde, cardamom, glazed pear\n\nBase: White amber, lychee, guava, a hint of frankincense\n\nI just received the scent, and although it's lovely, it hasn't quite captured that scent to me. Does anyone have any ideas of how to tweak this? I'm thinking of removing the peach, aldehyde, and cardamom; subbing a different citrus (yuzu or bergamot); upping the amount of pear; maaaaybe adding honey."

I don't smell the rose or cinnamon, and I'm not sure about pistachio, but I think I'm getting the cardamom, saffron, and orange flower, alongside the rice.

For clarity's sake, I'm only thinking about a P-type system as a) that is the popular option, and b) I can't see the light from the distant star in an S-type system having much effect during the day (but I could be wrong on that)."

It\u2019s not at all hard for me to motivate myself to go run five miles for fun. \n\nThe problem for me is cross-training. When I hit 30, I realized running wouldn\u2019t be enough to combat the fact that I\u2019m almost guaranteed to get osteoporosis (family history, bird bones, and prolonged corticosteroid use) and I needed to start doing weight-bearing exercise if I wanted my bones to keep from turning to dust. \n\nI started with body weight stuff, like some of the more intense vinyasa yoga classes, because lifting weights at the gym makes me want to die. Seriously. It\u2019s the most tedious, awful, horrible thing to me, and I can\u2019t remember how to use the machines or how much I should try to lift, and it just ends up a frustrating clusterfuck. \n\nI made a little progress doing vinyasa yoga, and I loosened up my tight hamstrings, which was good for running. \n\nI ended up asking my favorite yoga instructor for advice on cross training, and she invited me to her aerial silks class. It was miserably hard at first, but at least it wasn\u2019t boring, giving silks a huge edge over weightlifting for me. I kept at it mostly out of stubbornness, and the fact that at least it was better than the gym. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing silks for over a year now, and learning cool tricks is most of my motivation for getting stronger. \n\nMost kinda of exercise aren\u2019t that exciting. I had to find a kind of exercise that involves hanging upside down from the ceiling and doing backwards drops to keep myself motivated and keep my adhd-addled brain involved.",

I actually used to lock out my elbows in downward dog, just like you described, but my instructor caught it right away - like, at my first class at this studio. \n\nIf OP could find a yoga class (maybe vinyasa?) with small class sizes and interactive instructors, it might be helpful. That\u2019s what worked for me. I found other strength training programs inaccessible, since I couldn\u2019t even do the easiest and most basic versions of the workouts. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m way more likely to get hurt working out on my own than in a class, because I have no idea where my limbs are (or how far my elbows are bending lol).  Having an instructor who understands hyper mobility is super helpful and a huge asset toward injury prevention. \n\nI managed to build enough upper body strength through yoga that I\u2019ve started doing aerial silks and circus arts!\n\nI",
