Primarily we seem to exist in fiction- especially movies- to be evil bigoted preachers, uptight WASPs, strawman puritan villagers, etc. I actually started a blog about characters who had Protestant faiths and eventually had to stop because I simply ran out of characters to feature that I could think of- and a lot of those were not even necessarily devout/practicing.\n\nIt's not like we've never had positive Protestant role models and heroes to root for. Pilgrim's Progress, The Vicar of Wakefield, Little Women, the Little House books, etc. Largely ones written in the past. I'm disappointed more writers of this faith either don't create protagonists who share it, or perhaps their work just isn't well known enough. \n\nBy contrast, the good Christian characters are predominantly Catholic. I imagine this is because Hollywood prefers the glamour of stained glass, candles, statues, and colorful robes to earnest prayer, passionate singing and simpler services, and horror movies especially seem fascinated by Catholic art of the crucifix.\n\nI don't know what I'm getting at exactly except I guess I just needed to vent. It's tiring. As a writer myself with Protestant leads and messages, I'm okay with knowing my work probably will never make it big, but I still would like to see more of us in fiction. I'm not saying no protagonists should be Catholic, but is asking for one or two Protestants who aren't hateful, cartoonish villains for the hero to defeat so much?\n\nINB4 \"don't expect anything from secular Hollywood\". I know; I don't. My point is it's frustrating that only Catholics get the privilege of being mainstream Christian characters. I don't think that's such a ridiculous objection, from someone who greatly enjoys creating and consuming fiction and sharing the gospel that way as well. And it's not only secular people, other Christians are also guilty of not only doing this but supporting fiction that does."

You were in charge of an island that you could populate with people. I believe your people could farm, hunt, and fish.\n\nYou could click on individual citizens of your village, you could see their various stats. I know for a fact you could change the name of individual citizens. I know that you could also see how old each citizen was. You could click on two citizens, make them go have babies, and I believe if your \"mating\" was successful the woman would come out of the tent, carrying a baby.\n\nThe most notable thing I remember was when a villager died, a tiny skeleton would be laying on the ground where they died. You could then have other villagers come, pick up the bones, and I believe they put them in urns that you could lay around the village.I don't believe that this was a browser game. I think it was downloaded on to the computer.I remember that the game was really easy to play, even as an elementary school kid with little previous experience working with computer games.\n\nThank you."

Anyone who speaks (any level of) Esperanto? Or who knows someone who speaks Esperanto?\n\nI'm not going to translate the whole thing. What I want to do is translate:\n\n1. the names of the books;\n2. the VFD-coded phrases; and\n3. the names of places.\n\nI don't have the time and energy right now to dedicate myself to translating all of the books, so my idea is making it possible to at least talk about this universe in Esperanto.\n\nIf you or anyone you know knows any Esperanto and would like to join me and help in the translation, reach out to me! You can reach out to me in any way here on Reddif, or, preferrably, on Discord (iguer#6744)."

                "body": "I'm re-reading The Unauthorized Autobiography and that's something I didn't remember from the first time reading it, so it was a surprise this time around:\n\nQuigley Quagmire was to be taken by Uncle Monty, but Uncle Monty didn't get the message they were trying to send him.\n\nWe have the script of some scenes of the movie with the words that form the code per the Sebald Code method underlined and the coded message reads:\n\n>Attention\\[,\\] hidden in the snowman is a survivor of the fire\\[. M\\]eet us in the town where this film takes place\\[. B\\]ring the thre children. Your new assistant is not one of us! Beware!\n\nWe can already know it's Quigley because he's the one who's referred to as \"the survivor of the fire\" in the series. But besides that, there's also a picture of three children --one girl and two boys-- who look like siblings and that has the girl and one boy paired together with a crayon and the other boy marked with a question mark. That points to them being the Quagmires.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udzx8gtxhl3a1.png?width=398&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=19c2353623ba41e86a5d1b116e672131898c0f93\n\nGustav Sebald's sister says in the note that this picture was among the files of Zombies in the Snow, which further supports that \"the survivor of the fire\" who is hidden in the snowman is Quigley.\n\nSomething else that she says is that the snowman was up for days before Gustav realizing his message hadn't been received. That, together with this other excerpt from this chapter of the Autobiography:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/os0tkv4mil3a1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b22fa4cdf0b978ee78b5b0730d8c5ca536dc2a88\n\nshows that Uncle Monty didn't know about the Sebald Code, which is another interesting point. This circles back to the point of there being a lot of confusion caused by the Schism in regards to who knows about what codes. The Schism made some of the more recent recruits, like the adults in present time in the series, not be aware of all the codes that VFD used to use.\n\nAnd so, Quigley could have joined the Baudelaires in book two, but sadly that's not how the story went.\n\nThere is, however, one inconsistency in this with what is said in The Slippery Slope when Quigley meets the Baudelaires. Quigley explains his journey from the moment his house burned down and he says he wandered in the tunnels and ended up in Uncle Monty's house; he doesn't mention any detour, anything about meeting people who had a plan of introducing him to Uncle Monty.\n\nI can think of one explanation for that, and that is that those who met him stressed the importance of secrecy for the plan to work, which made him doubt whether he should share this part of the story with the Baudelaires or just skip it, given that it didn't change anything in the end, because the plan didn't work, obviously."

Op's wife and I sound very, very similar from op's description of her struggles, and deleting time-wasting apps did wonders for my productivity and my mental health. I didn't really miss those apps when they were gone. They didn't make me happy; they were just an easy source of dopamine that my brain wanted to reach for because of my ADHD.

Maybe she needs a different dosage or a different medication altogether.\n\n2. Get her in to see a therapist or counselor that specializes in ADHD. They can teach her strategies that will work for her specific struggles, and they can identify if there are other issues like depression that might need to be addressed.\n\n3. Ask her to delete whatever app she spends the most time on. This made a huge difference for me for a while because scrolling on my phone became painfully boring. \n\nYou can also try to \"game-ify\" the tasks she needs to get done. There's an app called Habitica that turns your to do lists and daily habits into an RPG game where you create a character and level them up by completing your tasks. Finch is an app that lets you raise a cute little baby bird and help it grow up and go on adventures by completing items on your to do list. It's definitely dopamine-inducing to level up your bird, buy them clothes, furnish their house, and talk to them when they get back from adventuring and learning about their world. A dopamine reward is the only way to get an ADHDer to repeatedly do any task. There's also an app called Routinely that isn't a game in and of itself, but it feels like a game when you're running through your to do list. You create routines with timers for every task, so it feels like a race against the clock. It's fun to try to see how quickly you can finish each item on your to do list, and or feels really rewarding when you start consistently finishing an entire morning/evening routine.",

Then they turn around and feed me those lines like \"I could never be vegan\" or \"you would starve at my house\" like they're somehow proud of that. I don't know how to respond to most of that nonsense. I want to shut it down as soon as it starts, but I don't want to be rude. I just want to eat my food.\n\nI assume this is normal and I should just get used to it, but how do you guys navigate these sorts of conversations? I enjoy good faith conversations about veganism, but those are very few and far between. Really, I just want to be able to eat my food in peace and not have to justify my choices every time I eat in front of someone else.

This year, I was thinking about writing appreciation/thank you letters to my parents and step parents. As an adult, I've become aware of just how much they sacrificed to give my siblings and me the best life possible, and I want to express my thanks to them.\n\nMy questions are: \n\n1. When parents say they don't want a gift, do they really mean they don't want a gift?\n\n2. Would you appreciate something like this from your child? Would you still appreciate it from an adult child, or would it feel like a cheap copout?\n\n3. Would it be weird to send one to my ex step mom? She was my step mom through most of my childhood, but we've fallen out of touch.\n\n4. Should I be worried about the letters not coming across as equal? I was always closer with my dad and butted heads with my mom & step mom quite a bit in the past (mostly in my teenage years), and I'm afraid that might unintentionally come through in my letters.\n\n5. Do you have any tips to make it a good/better gift? Do you think it would matter if it was typed or hand written?"

I want a 9 to 5 job. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s time to make a big change. I get the idea here that you all are over answering questions like this, but I\u2019ve searched around and I haven\u2019t found the answer. What would my pathway be to a career in data science? Could I teach myself the skills or do I need actual formal training like a masters? I\u2019m okay with a title like \u201cjunior data scientist\u201d for a while. I know I would advance. I\u2019m more just scared to make the change, unclear on what I would need to do, and I\u2019m need of guidance.

We\u2019ve watched every Jackson Galaxy clip on all of YouTube. We\u2019ve got the vertical space, the toys, etc. I think we\u2019ve figured out the food issues at this point. He has a cat sister who he adores and plays with, and there\u2019s nothing stopping him from being an extremely happy cat. \n\nHowever, he insists on cuddling with my husband 8+ hours a day, tries to wake him up at 5 am to do more cuddling and then stares at him intently the rest of the time. We adopted him at the shelter because of his instant attraction to my husband. They told us that his first owner died, and we suspect he looks or smells like my husband. \n\nAbout a year ago, we started him on anti-anxiety medication, and that really helped, especially with the morning behavior. I\u2019m always recommending that here, bc it was such a win for us. However, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s still really fixated on my husband, and I wish I could communicate to him that it\u2019s okay now and that we\u2019re not going anywhere, so he can relax. \n\nIf he was a person, I would take him to therapy for some EMDR lol.

So after much deliberation and consideration I\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s settled. I am a D.\n\nWhat threw me is that I\u2019m a conventionally curvy woman.

I look so good in a close fitting suit. \n\n- I could never get jewelry to look right and tended to not wear it.\n\n- I always felt like jumpsuits were a secret weapon. Want to look amazing?Grab a jumpsuit. I have at least ten.\n\n- I cannot for my life get a single ruffle to look right on me. \n\n- About five years ago I realized that I didn\u2019t have a single pattern in my closet. I intentionally bought some things to correct this. However, I really shouldn\u2019t have. \n\n- I\u2019ve tried everything to get high rise jeans to not look bad, and I\u2019ve never managed it.\n\n- I constantly looked a bit overgrown in my clothes even though they fit."

Again, around year seven this also seemed to change. I always felt it, but it wasn\u2019t as traumatic. \n\nI\u2019m now at year thirteen. \n\nLast year I spent a few weeks in Asia. I had help ordering in the language, but I know I had some gluten along the way and did have minor symptoms. I didn\u2019t get really sick until my tenth day - which is crazy for me. I had this Australian protein powder (thinking it was safe) only to find it had lots of barley in it - that did me in finally. Still, I suspected I wasn\u2019t as reactive as I used to be. \n\nYesterday I accidentally ate a piece of non gluten free pizza. While I do feel it today, it\u2019s not at all how it would have been before. My symptoms are mostly mood and focus. Bit of a rash. Some unusual stomach stuff but nothing too bad at all. \n\nHonestly I\u2019m really shocked. Has anyone had this kind of change happen? I feel like I need to be careful. I don\u2019t want to undo the progress made, but I\u2019m also thinking perhaps I can be a bit more adventurous than I am currently. I am very very strict with it as a result of the early sensitivity.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to give a quick update for anyone who finds this post. I did end up having noticeable intestinal symptoms. However, it gradually got worse over two and a half days before it was at the level to bother me, and it was not *that* bad. I still think I am less reactive and would love to hear it if someone has also experienced this."

Now, it can't do that, and even if I remove ALL of my focus modes, no scheduled or smart sleep/work/driving/anything, it still fails to go off.\n\nI'm hypothesizing this has something to do with notifications from iPhone pushing to AppleWatch when wrist detection is turned on... but if I turn it off, then I don't get sleep/cardio tracking, so what's the point?\n\nI have been an Apple ecosystem consumer (and push it on my family) for about twenty years now, and this is the first Apple product that I feel like they totally missed the mark and they're messing with how I want to live my life (the complaint I have always heard from Windows/Android users). \n\nThe worst part is that I travel for work and rely on this app to wake me up in hotels, etc, with multiple QR/Barcode scan alarms throughout the morning that keep me on track, and now because AppleWatch is \"clever,\" it's overriding my architected solution.\n\nAny workarounds?"

I recently went in and changed the amount that was being deposited between the accounts (acc 1 has more than acc 2, it was the opposite before), but since I've done that my other account has not been receiving any paychecks, and instead, the full amount is being deposited to account 1 only. I've tried to go into ADP and change it all again (I tried re-changing the $ amount, removing Acc 2 and re-adding it), but nothing has changed. I work at a HomeGoods store in MA, and I brought this up to my manager, but he said he has no idea why this is happening and I should contact my bank. So, I tried contacting my bank for the 2nd account to see if they were blocking anything, and they said they had no reason to (no). They advised me to double check if ADP was using the correct routing number, and I did check, and it is correct. I tried to contact ADP but I couldn't get ahold of anyone. The robot said it's not their issue and I should speak to my employer. Basically, I feel like I'm being sent in circles. I don't know what to do. Does anyone know why this is happening? What should I do? \nAlso, this whole issue started happening after around payroll time before New Years. In case that's important. Please help :("

Their official bios, I find them very similar and although they definitely feel like the clique that will get along well, if I were to close my eyes I don't think I could tell them apart. In the series, Sabrina seems like the more open-minded chill one while Meline is the supreme diva, and all I've got out of Aesha is that she likes them being a team. But other than that, what sets them apart as characters?? Feel free to share your opinions and headcanons if you want."

Recommendations much appreciated. \n\nTo sum it up:\n- wireless overear headphones\n- under 350 USD\n- Decent quality audio (current daily music headphones are what was considered great quality - when they came out in 2016)\n-Mic maybe? Or can be plugged into a aux cord with a mic attached for Xbox, but still works. \n\nI understand if there's nothing quite matching my pickiness - but appreciate any attempts. Thank you."

She is a hypochondriac and uses the excuse of not feeling well to get out of doing anything. \nShe believes that life has dealt her a bad hand even though she has never worked a day in her life, has always married for money, and is now living off of a pretty good pension from her deceased husband's job.\nShe never had any interest in raising her children. Anytime that we were too much work for her, she would send us to live with our father. He ended up raising all of us. All of us were quiet, relaxed, book worm type kids. Rarely made any noise or asked for anything. \nShe has no friends. Her neighbors in her retirement community try to befriend her, but she avoids and ignores them.\nShe recently admitted to me that her online boyfriend is more important to her than I am. She has never met him in person, but she is under the impression that he is very rich. \nHer older children have basically disowned her years ago. They come for Christmas and see her at any family events (if she is not \"too sick\" to go) and are pleasant, but that is all of the contact that they keep with her. Everytime, she starts an argument with at least one of us or one of our spouses.\nI have felt guilt for years, for not actually wanting to spend time with my mother, and actively avoiding her. I always felt like I was a bad person for not spending time with my own mother, but i could never bring myself to actually want to see her because it is always a huge effort. I could never just go to talk or have coffee together. There would always be something she needed from me. Always someone she wanted to complain about. Always something bad she wanted to tell me about my father (whom she divorced 39 years ago.)\nI still love her, but I don't have to like her. She is not a good person. She does not love me the way a mother should love their child. I have finally realized that it's ok to not like her and it's the most freeing feeling.\nGuilt can keep you trapped for a long time. Hopefully others will read this and realize that their guilt is not always theirs to carry. \n\nTL DR; My mother is not a good person and I finally realized that it's ok to not like her"

I don't know if he is bored with me, or if he has other FWBs, or if he just doesn't require very much sex. \nI put absolutely no rules on this relationship, all of the guidelines were set by him.\nDo you guys think he's bored, that I am making myself too available, that i should just move\n on, or anything else? \n\n TD:LR My FWB doesn't seem to want to have sex  more than once every month or two, but when we do, it is amazing."

But as per the article claims it has higher recoil and at distances it\u2019s not shooting very flat so it\u2019s harder to be effective. Like every round it has pros and cons though. It has considerable more stopping power <300m so if your engagement is close 6.8 is a definite winner. \n\nIf if you know you\u2019re going up against a bunch of Somalis high on Khat in the middle of Mogadishu; then yeah more stopping power than what an m855 5.56 round offers would be ideal. That engagement is one of the big ones that made the military reconsider 5.56\u2019s effectiveness but it\u2019s not 5.56\u2019s fault. \n\nMy opinion, it\u2019s hard to beat 5.56 when it comes down to the Jack of all trades medal. A small fast projectile with ranges out to 500-600m, it\u2019s light, easy and most of all incredibly easy to shoot. It works well as the standard issue round but I think the military just needs to consider having multiple rounds to choose from instead of buying all of one stock.",

This was during Covid bullshit so it was basically an annoyance to do anything. Going to the gym, the grocery store, and the library, it all required a mask which made breathing harder. I had my last straw when a gym owner screamed at me mid bench set for not wearing a mask (I only took it down while benching so I could breathe, otherwise I was perfectly respectful).  I truly felt at that point people lost their sanity. He could've waited 7 seconds and kindly asked me. So I basically just said fuck all that and sat inside getting obliterated. The fun ran out probably 5 days into that festival but here I am 2 years later finally deciding I need to stop wasting my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst I'll list some symptoms:\n\nInsomnia- I've kinda always struggled with a sleep schedule. Even waking up at 5am for 4 years straight didn't help. I just know I have used weed to sleep easier and now not using weed to sleep easier has made sleeping easier damn near impossible. I've been up for 24 hours currently\n\nIrritability- It feels like things annoy me very easily so I've found myself biting my tongue a lot. Using CBD and ZYN pouches has helped with that.\n\nDiarrhea- Day 1 and 2 has been a liquid shitting fest so far.\n\nHeadache- I'm not one to get headaches too often but this one is like a head heaviness feeling. Hard to describe. Like a malaise head feeling.\n\nBody temperature- I've been switching between cold and hot sweats. I typically wear the same shit every day and my apartment stays at 70. It's not super bad to like a fever but it is definitely noticeable. I hope this symptom goes away first.\n\nBasically I have flu like symptoms on day 1 and 2. That wasn't expected but I'm going to get through it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat has helped me: meditation, focusing on eating right, seeing the sun. Meditation is extremely important for quitting so far. Highly suggest giving just 15 minutes a shot. But I am confident if I reach a month, I will be on the golden road to sobriety or at least controlled mj use. I will post again a week from now to re-evaluate my symptoms."

They can promote growth, empathy and change.\n\nBut not my fights. I\u2019m left feeling exhausted for weeks. I lose my appetite for days, lose interest in all activities, sleep a ton.\n\nThe worst part is that it slowly makes the bond weaken with my partner. It makes it incredibly difficult to return to where we were before the fight. I don\u2019t want to touch them or look at them. And being intimate again may take weeks. This isn\u2019t sustainable in a long term relationship.\n\nWe are both in therapy, I\u2019ve done DBT. I always find myself in relationships where we fight dirty, where words are said to hurt the other person, where I am using all my strength to restrain from hitting them, because we were hit as kids and I don\u2019t know what to do with this anger. \n\nFighting is especially bad in situations where we are trapped- I\u2019d say the worst arguments ever are in a car or a public place where we can\u2019t express or leave the situation.\n\nAny advice or books or anything? I\u2019m so tired of these failed relationships that start well and then fill up with resentment and anger. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore and I\u2019m too old for this."

He gets upset at the fact that the other student is only using half of his potential and one of the arguments he makes it that how would Todoroki face against worse villains when he's purposefully diminishing his power. These points make sense and why Izuku is also upset and angry about this wpuld make sense because he wanted a quirk all his life and now here's this kid who is deliberately holding back.\n\nBut. I believe Todoroki SHOULD NOT have to use the other half of his quirk if he does not want to. It made him upset and uncomfortable and he had a goal to become a hero that did not resemble his father in any way. He also was doing it with spite because he knew how much his father wanted him to use the half hot side of his quirk. \n\nNow I know that something like this would not make Todoroki a suitable hero or even a trustworthy one. Because how could other heroes trust him to fight alongside with them when he is constantly not using his full power to save lives? So I'm kind of stuck here because I think quirks are like an identity and they are of course part of the person. So this is Todoroki's identity and should he be judged so harshly for rejecting a part of himself and being happy about it? \n\nI think I would be happy even if he just used his half ice part of his quirk and maybe used his other side to melt things and other stuff but not generate flames. \n\nHowever, it gets more complicated if this physically hurts and weakens him. So it's frustrating for me, because on one hand Todoroki should be able to do whatever he wishes with his body but on the other hand he is hurting himself in the long run. \n\nWhat would be the best solution other than forcing him to use his quirk? Hm. Probably therapy haha"

If we did, I'd imagine our society as a whole would be very mediocre at best. Some of the most famous legends were about people down bad for a girl and did the craziest shit to impress them. I think it's also worth mentioning that men need to become people who have redeemable characters, fucking around isn't going to impress traditional women, and non traditional women are often looking for something that fits their narrative, which is unlikely to be from the male demographic.\n\nIn this age of modern politics, women are extremely skeptical, and will ghost the moment something seems off. Yes they can afford to do that, but most men do the same in  situations. Yes women have a absolutely larger dating pool, except they don't want pictures of someone's cock or to be sexually groomed online. Also the majority of men, even some attractive men don't know how to talk to women. I've literally just started to go out and have experienced reasonably well results. (I am 5'6 and overweight).

Only use a few mods, and keep them fairly small, I use calamity, calamity music, alchnpc lite, luiafk, magic storage and wing slot. Avoid any big content mods (other than calamity ofc), only use calamity and smaller quality of life mods. I started with only calamity and added a mod every couple weeks without a crash until I had this list. I may be overcautious, but hey, its working so far.\n2. Don't use a large world, I find small worlds much less laggy (and less chance of any crashes), if you can tolerate the buggy world gen then small is best, if not, medium is alright too, just dont use large.\n3. Pay attention to any bugs and game crashes, and post them to the mod discord, some of the time its just the game being weird and it doesnt matter (a crash soon after reaching hardmode is pretty common from what ive seen) if you wanna be super safe you could make backups on a USB after a crash to make sure ur data is ok if it happens again.\n4. Make sure your mods are updated, calamity is slowly getting better, and becomes less buggy every update, and keeping your mod up to date will avoid any issues that theyve already fixed.\n5. If the bad stuff does happen, ask around on the discord and this sub, there are some good tactics that can work.\n\nhope that helps",

I had to put it away for a while and picked up again on Drops for vocabulary, and I'm using Duolingo for some of the basics with phrases etc. Sometimes I also use the Nemo Korean app, which is like flashcards. I intended to just master Duolingo's course and then get a more serious beginner's resource. It seems like a lot of people aren't crazy about apps, but I've found it sort of helpful to get started from knowing almost nothing.\n\nI can't afford to go to Korea, and I don't have a ton of time, but I'm curious what helped other people the best when you were just starting out.\n\nMy goal is to be able to watch dramas without subtitles. Not because I so desperately want to watch dramas. I just have a good Korean accent and I enjoy the language and culture. I will visit someday if I get the chance."

So, sometimes I just want to wear some makeup so I don't look dead or on my way to death. \n\nUnfortunately, I have tried a lot of different options and found a couple helpful skincare products, but no foundation, even if I hardly use any, it looks like I have too much on, or even after exfoliating, clings to the tiny face hairs you usually can't see to look like dandruff or something. I have used brushes, sponges and my fingers. Regardless, it just looks like I put too much on. I honestly just like to not look sick. I don't care much about contouring or whatever; I want to look like me, but healthy. The effect is only where I have sun damage.\n\nDoes anyone else have trouble with this? Have you found a solution that works well or a product that works for you?\n\n\n\nP.S. To be honest, I've been too embarrassed to even ask my doctor to look into eds still, because its so hard to get people to take stuff like this seriously and I already went through it with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Plus, you know, it will probably look attention-grabby or like I'm a hypochondriac. But anyway, I still suspect it as a probability for me. So, I haven't confirmed I have this condition.\n\n\nNote: thank you for all the advice! I'm going to consider some of these next time I shop."

Other things are exactly how I want them. \n\nI've been trying all kinds of different things but it doesn't seem to matter. I'm afraid that it is because items are touching each other's space boxes, but if that's true, a basket of flowers or a plate of sweets would have to look very sparse and that would be annoying so I just don't want to.\n\nWith each item I have:\n\n* checked the \"don't havok settle\"\n* added script \"defaultblockactivation\"\n* added script \"defaultdisablehavokonload\"\n* opened the havokonload script to edit, opened the first two items as if to edit but changed nothing, and then left the edit window\n* added collision barriers\n* removed collision barriers\n* widened collision barriers\n* shrunk collision barriers\n* spread out items (which I undid in some cases because it didn't work and didn't look as good)\n\nI am really hoping I don't have to redo everything. Sometimes I have gotten it nearly perfect, but I try to tweak things to make everything stay where it is supposed to, and then somehow that tweaking ruins the whole thing and I can never replicate the same effect.\n\nAny advice welcome."

They were around 5-6 I would guess. We saw the car park just as we arrived, so we assumed they must have gotten there and hopefully the parent(s) just popped in very quickly so we headed inside the shop, but I really wasn\u2019t feeling good about it, so I was saying maybe we should call 101. \n\nSent my husband back out to see if they were still there and they were, so I said can you stay to keep an eye on them, because I\u2019m really worried about these children. I texted a friend who works at the police, but at this point I figured even if she doesn\u2019t respond I\u2019m calling 101.\n\nAfter ~25 minutes, the children are still in there, no adult in sight. We took a picture of the registration number and called 101, while on the call, the Dad showed up, loaded the car, so we told the police he\u2019s back but they did take a note on it in case other reports come in.\n\nWe hung up, and the Dad is gone again\u2026 I think this time he was just dropping the trolley because he was back and they left & so did we.\n\nI just keep wondering what others think of this, obviously it\u2019s not a hot day when I would worry about car overheating, but there are still so many things that could go wrong? \n\nSo yea, wanna hear what others would have done / think, I\u2019m still just a bit shaken up because it really upset me"

For example we live in a 3d world with coordinates x,y,z,light passes through our own visualisation and orientation but not every orientation is universal such is the basis of relativity. How would you define that in a 4d world,how time would pass in that case?how would gravity have an impact if there would be any?etc..\nI would be honored to get your thoughts,even if you dont know anything about the topic, just be creative,it is through creativity that we change the world.\u2728\nI'am doing this to get an external opinion about this topic so it would be great if you can give your opinion about it.

SHE was responsible, for everything. this behaviour is crystal clear in her work and lifestyle. even in her work team, she is the powerhouse and the main person pushing through regardless of others slacking off. she takes it upon herself to make things work.\n\ntogether, my parents don\u2019t get to heal. they are stuck in the life they think they are meant for, that they have been conditioned to live. my mum is desensitised to my dad\u2019s poor behaviour, it is scary how blind she is to how he has hurt us. i truly believe that the only reason she is with my father is because he does not depend on others for money, like her dad did. but i believed she has ignored all of his other horrible aspects because she so badly wanted financial stability when she was young. i think she was scared more than anything to end up with someone that would make her truly relive her childhood.\n\nin my mother\u2019s family, females were the breadwinners. in my dad\u2019s, the males were. to my mother, my dad is enough. he makes money and provides. my dad has won her over by giving the bare minimum (or less). he is one of the few men in her life that have not failed to such a degree that her father did. the fault when comparing men and her father is that MOST people, even shitty people, are better than her father. that\u2019s why i believe she settled for the first person that wasn\u2019t exactly like her father. even if my dad is emotionally immature and unavailable, selfish and narcissistic, none of that mattered to her. it didn\u2019t register. she just wanted to find someone reliable, in some way. someone that could give her a slight bit of hope; that could redeem the people that failed her. she was so desparate to find someone even just a slight bit better than her dad. her expectations, i believe, stooped so low because of her experience. to the point that almost anyone who slightly tried would probably make her feel contented.\n\nshe is okay with crumbs. she has settled for crumbs because she has been starved. any fraction of decency in my father, sometimes imagined, is applauded by my mother. but i am not satisfied with these crumbs, and i know that even though my physical needs are met i have been failed in every other way. my mother can be okay with that, even though that\u2019s very sad, but i am not. and i won\u2019t ever be. i never have. and this angst i have towards my parents is rampant and fiery and i won\u2019t ever forgive them for bringing me into this world only to torture me with their mistakes. the adults in my life have failed me in dreadful ways and i won\u2019t let gaslighting or misunderstanding falsify my truth."

Ni is basically gathering information from the world and putting it under your subjective analysis in order to interpret the data and make decisions based on it, which is what Fe does for us (it is a judging function). if i could summarise Ni i\u2019d say that it\u2019s basically about making inferences/conclusions about the external world through \u2018hunches\u2019, or what we call intuition. you may feel that you have always had very strong intuition, or more particularly emotional intelligence and are thus quite empathic\u2014i believe this resulted due to adapting to traumatic parents where we had to develop these skills in order to protect us from pain.\n\njust think about it for a second. you put Ni and Fe together and you get someone who makes inferences about what other people want and need. you are out of tune with your needs and what you truly want because when you were young you had to neglect yourself to feel secure, and the Ni contributes to being so in your head and anxious because you may be interpreting things that aren\u2019t really there (e.g. supposed signs of LO reciprocating). Ni is very future focused and so it can manifest as scanning for future consequences that we deem dangerous, and thus try to avoid. thus, i wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a multitude of those that have OCD, particularly pure ocd are infj\u2019s as well\u2014the infj label is just resultant of our conditioning.\n\nNi-Fe may be why you contemplate so much about whether LO loves you back or not. you find yourself ruminating on endless questions even though you may know the answer deep down; that would be your intuition, but that is what you neglect in the pursuit of utter certainty. you don\u2019t trust yourself and that\u2019s an issue. it\u2019s also an issue when you are giving yourself up for someone who does not deserve you, and are doing so because you are not honouring your own needs. this is understandable as you once had to give yourself up to make someone else happy\u2014the costs felt huge in childhood, but now you\u2019re an adult that can choose who you surround yourself with, for the most part. you need to be more selfish and spend more time tuning into your own needs. once you do and start acting on what YOU believe, you will attract people that love you authentically because you are showing up as your authentic self.\n\nthe mbti test on 16personalities.com is inaccurate but i think it\u2019s fine to use in this context. feel free to take the test and list your type below? i wanted to make a poll but it wouldn\u2019t allow me\ud83d\ude2d"

you want something from them that they simply can\u2019t offer. that\u2019s how i felt with my dad. i had needs; there were qualities i desired in a parent as a child that i craved for so bad. but i couldn\u2019t have that with my dad, and it sucked because he was supposed to love me, and i was meant to feel loved. that was his responsibility, but it became mine when i realised that he couldn\u2019t fulfil that.\n\nsee how such can be likened to limerence? you have essentially put it upon yourself to ensure that you are receiving love from someone who won\u2019t willingly give it to you, or at least express it in the way you desire. as far as you know, love has become a full time job, and its tiring.\n\ni know that a lot of you feel guilt and shame for needing things that your LO can\u2019t give without your own initiation, but you shouldn\u2019t. everyone has needs, and they need to be honoured [by those who love you/those that deserve you]. i\u2019m sure that you guys have tried really hard to meet your LO\u2019s needs, and maybe you have, but they don\u2019t do the same for you and that\u2019s what makes this experience so unhealthy. remember, you are only obsessive over this person because they are not giving you what you want. interacting with them is sending your mind into overdrive because you're literally performing mental gymnastics trying to find a way for them to reciprocate, even though you know deep down that they won't.\n\nso, you must snap yourself out of it and foster enough self respect for you to stop. that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to distance yourself from LO, otherwise you will continue to go crazy for someone who will never fulfil your needs.\n\nwhat you desire in love is so important and key to feeling appreciated and safe and free, however you are doing yourself a disservice by leeching off someone who won\u2019t fulfil your needs voluntarily. you are torturing yourself by neglecting your desires, your values and your beliefs for a person who straight up violates all those things, but you ignore that and rely on them anyway. or rather, you\u2019re relying on yourself to prompt them to fulfil your needs; because remember, without you playing your part, limerence cannot continue.\n\nmaybe at some point in your life your brain and body registered that you had to compromise your authentic self for love, and so you are now putting yourself through so much turmoil because you are reenacting traumas and family dynamics that you never fully healed from.\n\n2 years ago i was really limerent for someone who didn\u2019t fulfil my needs. he seemed aloof and unbothered and boring. he was not what i wanted. you know what i really wanted in a person i loved? i wanted them to be caring, considerate, compassionate and understanding. i would\u2019ve liked my dad to embody that, but he didn\u2019t. that was my love language, that was what i needed, and i beat myself up because i internalised his issues and made myself feel responsible for the lack of love (or \u2018proper\u2019 love) he expressed.\n\nyou are not the issue. you are not broken. you are as worthy as any other and should not give yourself away in the pursuit of what another could give you. at one point in your life you established that what other people thought of you was more important than what you thought of yourself, and so when you obsess over someone and persist on someone whom you know deep down isn\u2019t the one, you are caught on hoping for someone who will never give you what you want because you place your needs below theirs and vice versa for them. you say to yourself, hey, i can compromise myself a little bit if that\u2019s what it takes to guarantee love\u2014but it shouldn\u2019t work like that. that\u2019s not what love is. love should feel freeing and calm with the right person, with the person who willingly meets your needs on their own accord. any other sort is chaotic and a distraction from the work you need to do for yourself.\n\nyou are not too much. you are not overly emotional or fucked. however, you will continue to feel that way if you attach yourself to people who serve you the bare minimum, or less. i know how fucking difficult it is to distance yourself from LO, but it\u2019s so worth it. you can\u2019t put this much emphasis on other people\u2019s opinion of you anymore. you can\u2019t escape yourself anymore. you have to do the scariest thing, which is make your needs known to others and stand up for yourself, even if it comes at the cost of rejection. because you know what? losing people could never compete with the utter pain of rejecting yourself. by voicing your beliefs and desires, you are allowing people to see you for your authentic self, and thus you won\u2019t feel the need to control how others think of you because whether they want to stay or leave is up to them. you have already done your part by showing up authentically; by essentially telling others to take it or leave it. by voicing your needs, you are attracting people who are able to meet those needs, who are able to reciprocate with no chaos and obsession having to be involved on your part. you will attract those that bring you peace, and you won\u2019t feel like you need anything else because you are no longer rejecting yourself for people who don\u2019t love you. you will no longer feel a hole in your heart because you are not giving yourself up for non-guaranteed love.\n\nand guess what, if people do leave after you voice your needs, at least they left you because you were being honest about who you are. it's better than only being appreciated for accommodating to LO in a way that strays from the real you.\n\nin a way, you can view your growth as trying to be more like your LO. it is highly likely that they are not reciprocating because they value themselves and their needs more than yours; thus, try to be more like that (they are doing no wrong in considering what they want and acting on that; you only feel pain because you are latching onto someone who cannot fulfil you the way you want. it is your problem for seeking something in places where it can\u2019t be found). be selfish, even if it feels wrong. you do not need to latch onto every bit of affection that comes your way. be more critical and serious when it comes to how others treat you. tune into how THEY make YOU feel, not the other way around. it is not your job to make others feel good. you are not responsible for your LO. you need to love yourself enough to set boundaries and realise that this person will never satisfy you, and trying so hard is a losing game. \n\nyou need to start putting yourself first, because NO ONE ELSE will put you first. you can\u2019t make LO accountable for that."

Anyway, here is:\n\n# Klojban, an Evolving Conlang: Introduction\n\nWith the downfall of [r/EvolvingConlang](https://www.reddit.com/r/EvolvingConlang/) and the rise of like ten others in its place, I firmly believe that a spiritual successor to it must be made.\n\nAnyways, here is Klojban, named in the same manner as Lojban was to Loglan.  Somewhat. It will have more rules than the other \"add features by commenting them\" conlangs:\n\n* The top three comments will be added instead of just the topmost one\n* The phonology must consist of actual phonemes; the grammar and lexicon, though, can be as wild as you want them to be\n* The orthography can be changed but it must be done in a separate comment.\n* If you want me to append a link to your suggestion, you can do so, but make sure it isn't NSFW or anything\n* Words added at the same time as a sound change do not have the sound change applied to them, as they are loanwords.\n\nWinning Changes\n\nBy u/Anjeez929 with 3 points:\n\n>We forgot to make a word for 16. \u0107\u00fdty is 16 while \u0107\u0259\u00f9ty is 15.  \n>  \n>nu, dhu, ty, pa, p\u00f6, \u015b\u0259\u00f9, \u015bun, \u015bud, \u0107\u00fey, \u015byp, \u015b\u00f0\u0259\u00f9, dhu\u015b, \u0107nn, \u0107\u0259\u00f9d, \u0107\u0259\u00f9ty, \u0107\u00fdty.  \n>  \n>Also,  \"senunu\" is the only irregular ordinal, so I feel like we need to mention it somewhere. How about make it a separate entry in the  dictionary so we don't have to put \"(u)nu\" for the number.  \n>  \n>Also why did I write \"(a)nu\"? \"Or\" is never going to have a prefix.  \n>  \n>Should  I do something about the fact that \"nu\" now means five different things? Nah. They'll understand by context and prefixes. Nu (ba)nu nu  \\[nu\\], in (maiku)nu\n\nFor the last sentence, I decided to do nothing for now.\n\nBy u/RBolton123 with 1 point:\n\n>\\- Velar trill becomes /\u0280/  \n>  \n>\\- Glottal trill becomes /\u029c/  \n>  \n>\\- /\u0267/ becomes /q/  \n>  \n>\\- Delete /x/ next to /\u028f/ because I can't pronounce it \ud83e\udd7a  \n>  \n>EDIT:  \n>  \n>\\- Merge Far Future and Very Far Future tense under *jo*  \n>  \n>\\- Merge Far Past and Very Far Past under *\u214e\u00e1*  \n>  \n>*-* Turn the nominalizer for adjectives into just *-y*\n\nAdded two words for the two new articulations:\n\nubula /u.'bu.la/ - (n) palatine uvula \\[natural phenomena class\\]; (adj) uvular\n\nThe \u201cepiglottal\u201d articulation is referred to by the phrase \u201cs\u00f0asa, in vokordi\u201d\n\n# Phonology\n\n|Consonants|Labial|Dental|Alveolar|Retroflex|Palatal|Velar|Uvular|Epiglottal|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Nasal|m||n n\u0329 <nn>||||q||\n|Stop|p b||t t\u02e4 <th> d d\u02e4 <dh>||\u025f <jl>|k1 g|||\n|Fricative||\u03b8 <\u00fe> \u00f0|s2 \u02853 <i>|\u0282 <\u015b>||x <j>|||\n|Affricate|||ts|\u0288\u0282 <\u0107>|||||\n|Approximant|||\u027b <\u0159>||j <y>|w <\u214e>|||\n|Lateral Approximant|||l||||||\n|Trill||r4 <r>|||||\u0280 <kr>|\u029c <hr>|\n\n1 - Represented by <c> only in the word *cog* /k\u0254g/, and <qu> in the word *Quepalt*\n\n2 - Represented by <z> only in the word *zako* /sak\u0254/\n\n3 - This is a vowel\n\n4 - Actually \\[r\u032a\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Vowels|Front|Mid|Back|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Close|i||u|\n|Mid|e, \u028f <y>, \u00f8 <\u00f6>|\u0259|\u028a <\u00f9>|\n|Open|a \u00e3 \\[\u0251\u0303\\] <\u00e3>||\u0254 <o> \u0254 <\u00f5>|\n\n1 - Represented by <e> only in the word *Quepalt*\n\nNasal Vowels appear before nasal consonants, although they are quite sporadic.

Head-initial. Plurals are formed by reduplication. Adjective and adverbs agree with the noun or verb they modify in tense and mood or noun class\n\nNouns and pronouns use noun classes, which are demarcated with **prefixes**. If the noun begins with a consonant, then the final vowel of the prefix (listed in brackets) is added. However, there are some words where it uses the same buffer vowel no matter which prefix gets added. \"t(o)-\"+\"li\u00f0a\" is \"tali\u00f0a\" not \"otoli\u00f0a\".\n\n* Abstract Concepts and/or Finnish: t(a)-\n* Natural Phenomena and Body Parts and/or Korean/Japanese: t(o)-\n* Natural Nonliving Objects: b(y)-\n* Artificial Nonliving Objects: jut(u)-\n* Food and/or Danish: \u00f0an(a)-\n* Gay Food and/or Gay Danes: \u00f0ain(a)-\n* Straight Food and/or Straight Danes: \u00f0aun(a)-\n* Bi Food and/or Bi Danes: \u00f0\u00e1n(a)-\n* Insects and/or Spanish: \u0107(y)-\n* Fish and/or French: k(a)-\n* Birds and/or English: k(i)-\n* Other Animals and/or Australian: maik(y)-\n* Gay (Non-insect, non-avian, non-fish) Animals and/or Gay Australians: mauk(y)-\n* Straight (Non-insect, non-avian, non-fish) Animals and/or Straight Australians: m\u00e3k(y)-\n* Bi (Non-insect, non-avian, non-fish) Animals and/or Bi Australians: m\u00e1k(y)-\n* Bad People: k(o)-\n* Normal People and/or Brazilian: cab(a)-\n* Gay Normal People and/or Gay Brazilians: caub(a)-\n* Straight Normal People and/or Straight Brazilians: caib(a)-\n* Bi Normal People and/or Bi Brazilians: c\u00e1b(a)-\n* Good People and/or Icelandic: pon(a)-\n* Gay Good People and/or Gay Icelanders: poin(a)-\n* Straight Good People and/or Straight Icelanders: poun(a)-\n* Bi Good People and/or Bi Icelanders: p\u00f3n(a)-\n* Bad Rulers: jub(\u00fa)-\n* Gay Bad Rulers: juib(\u00fa)-\n* Straight Bad Rulers: j\u00f9b(\u00fa)-\n* Bi Bad Rulers: j\u00fab(\u00fa)-\n* Normal Rulers and/or Thai: b(ei)-\n* Good Rulers and/or Chinese: tijyn(y)-\n* Gay Good Rulers and/or Gay Chinese: tyjyn(y)-\n* Straight Good Rulers and/or Straight Chinese: tiujyn(y)-\n* Bi Good Rulers and/or Bi Chinese: t\u00edjyn(y)-\n* Divine or Magical Concepts, Beings, etc. and/or Vatican: b(y)-\n* OP (me) and/or Texan: b(\u0259\u00f9)\n\nWords can also have different meanings when used as slang, which is indicated in \\[brackets\\].\n\nNouns follow ergative-absolutive alignment, with the absolutive marked with -by.\n\nIn addition, pronouns in the absolutive are attached to the verb, succeeding the subjunctive prefix.\n\nVerbs have 10 \"main\" tenses.

I was literally standing there with my hands squeezing the back of my neck, jaw clenched, entire body shaking to bear it without scratching.  \n\n\nIt lasted about 2 mins and I've been good the rest of the day, but I've never itched like that in my entire life. Just lucky no-one was around at the time, otherwise they may have thought I was on some crazy drugs or something.  \n\n\nIt's also worth noting that I've been consuming a lot of wheat lately, which I happen to be sensitive to (Puking, sore throat, burning throat, dry mouth). So maybe It's a combination of the 2 (sensitivity and anxiety)?"

                "body": "I want to start this off by saying I really do expect a respectful dialogue on this thread. I'm hoping no one will reply with hate.\n\nI feel like when Effy was young, she was neglected, starved for love and overall clearly bipolar 1. She was mentally ill, and not that it's an excuse, but as a child at the time, she needed some sort of adult with a clear head to recognize the signs and get her the help she so clearly needed.\n\nAnd eventually she did the help she needed (sort of) by the end. I'm not calling her an angel, I've definitely been disappointed a few times. But watching her story, especially as someone who struggles with Bipolar 1 myself really allowed me insight to understand how much pain she was actually in. \n\nIn my opinion, Cook really was one of the only few people that saw Effy for Effy, and not a manic pixie dream girl like Freddie.\n\nShe was lost, she clearly had a good heart, but was broken. An example of her true nature can be found in Gen 1, when she is tucking her pill drugged mother into bed and looks to be in pain. She asks Tony, \"What's the point in caring about people?\". Her pained expression emphasizes she is very hurt by the dynamics of her household, and inevitably begins to feel like everyone and everything is shit as a defense mechanism from ever being hurt again. \n\nHer destructive behaviors were not only a cry for help, but a direct testament to her protecting her psyche from further damage. One other instance to add on to this point, is where in Gen 1 again, Tony is spamming Michelle, and Effy replies \"Love, Love, Love. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing.\". During this phase of the show, we can see how tired Effy looks. She goes out partying and sleeping with people in attempts to feel something. How could she have the capacity at that point to care so much about other people? \n\nEven in Gen 2, she tells Pandora (after the accident) something along the lines of \"Tony isn't just (whatever she called him), he's amazing. He had to relearn everything again on his own.\" with this adamant look of fierce love and admiration. Message being she loves and clings so loyally to Tony because he was the only one who was looking out for her. \n\nI believe loyalty is in fact in Effy's true nature. We can observe this in Season 7 as well, where she takes care of Naomi who is dying, takes shit from Emily while going through the anxiety of potential imprisonment and guilt over the situation with Dom (I will admit my memory is hazy, I can't quite place if she threw Dom under the bus, but I don't remember her to.) and handles it all maturely, doesn't have violent outbursts when they were honestly warranted (like when her boss double crossed her) and overall seems to be doing all the right things. She is loyal to Dom who helped her by incriminating herself to save him, all while hiding her tears to stay strong for Naomi. She didn't turn to anyone, she never gave up on herself or Naomi. \n\nNaomi was clearly going through a depression (rightfully so) and it can be very difficult to take care of someone who is going through something like this on a daily and maintain your rationale. She was strong for everyone, this can be argued as maturity or could be argued that this is in fact her true nature after becoming a healthier individual. \n\nI just feel like when Effy was young she was a product of her environment and felt very alone and afraid. Not to mention battling psychosis all on her own and trying to defend what little sense of emotional stability she had by rejecting Freddie so many times. \n\nI could go on, but these are just some of the many points why I feel like her bad rep is unwarranted and a bit harsh for someone her age.\n\nThoughts?"

(I did pass my UG as average student)\n\nOkay, I understand your pain, but blaming your performane on not getting into your preferred college is kinda insane.\n\n>When I was in final year of my college, some of my friends were trying for MBA so they all attended CAT. I thought of giving it a try as well. When scores came, I got 71 percentile(not surprising I prepared for 1 day only) but i made the mistake of seeing what min percentile is required for few IIMs. For General, it was around 95 whereas for SC/ST, its around 65 or 70, i can't remember. I think the year was 2013 or 2014. This was another major shock.\n\nOkay, again, this time you accept your own mistake, but also, it should be understood that those SC/ST folks get a lot of hatred in IITs/IIMs because they got in \"easily\". \n\nI can suggest you to get out of India if you think it's unfair in India. Also less competition outside India too.",

                "body": "I hope you understand what survival mode exactly is, you are in some occasions your true self, where they find you attractive, and in many you aren't, and you falter and want to regress into a state of fear and cower/shrink yourself and you are unable to put your guard down(a guard which you made for your own protection while in survival mode), especially during something like a job interview for a better position.\n\nI think you focus too much on your best sides, which is good, but you forget your weakness, and that's why you are suffering. I think you also surround yourself with fake people, because the kind of friendships you have developed seem superficial, because you are someone who brings value to them, but do they point out to you valuable insights about your own behaviour in certain situations? If not, then you probably have no decent enough friends to cover your ass when you are in trouble. So go seek out friendships which are genuine or find out who is the most caring person or caring people amongst your friends and focus on them for a while and observe the little things.\n\nI also think you are all over the place, because you discovered Jung and now you think you found some sort of a \"cure it all\", absolutely not, you will of course become self aware as you learn, but to become your true self(or as people here in this subreddit would say individuate), you have to accept all parts of yourself and that's a painful process. \n\nAlso your dreams and aspirations in career and life are somewhat at a crossroads, but it need not be that you should sacrifice one for another. It could probably knock off a few good years in your career, but that's an adjustment and sacrifice you have to made, and that decision is on you. And you have to listen to yourself, and not anyone else, not media, not people here, what does your gut say to you?\n\nA lot of women really want to become something, and put their career first, which is very commendable, but think about your old age, what would you like? A pile of money is not going to solve your problem, not now and not later(maybe it might fill a hole in your emptiness). Recognize what money is for you, it's easier to say but money actives the same neural pathways of cocaine, so maybe that's why a lot of people are addicted to money and getting a lot more. I don't blame anyone for that, but just to recognize it is a path to becoming your true self, in the sense, you have to realize why you want a lot of money. And how much is enough to you.",

                "body": ">I managed to make a life for myself (MD, researcher, etc etc) and I am always getting better. I started dabbling in Jung a little over three months ago. It has helped me tremendously. I have been able to identify my shadow and touch the prima materia. I keep a dream journal and regularly analyse it.\n\nKeep doing this. And keep reading more on depth psychology. You are on the right path.\n\n>The problem is I keep slipping into the abused little girl mindframe. I am going to turn thirty soon and I have a lot to accomplish. But every time I stand at the door of opportunity I become this sheepish little girl, shaking with nerves, unable to establish herself. This seeps into all IMPORTANT aspects of my life. From career to marriage. I just can\u2019t move forward.\n\nThis is not new, you are not alone, millions of women are in your position(I'm not a woman), but I have heard from this Prof. Sam Vaknin that women have become powerful, but still don't know their powers, in all spheres. The goal here for you is to not become narcissistic or go insane because you can't handle the power. You have to recognize that you have gotten opportunities faster than you expected, not because you don't deserve it, but you don't have the brain which thrives and which feels safe. You grew up faster to adopt your circumstances only to survive it, but not thrive in it.\n\nYou cannot thrive in an environment with a survival brain. Your survival brain exists because you were abused. To make it a thriving one, you must actively replace your thought processes with a one which appreciates yourself for all the accomplishments you have achieved and recognize yourself with it. Many do it with affirmations, sometimes called positive affirmations, where people tell some phrases to themselves so they can soothe themselves and calm their nerves. But there are also other ways like meditation, No Sleep Deep Rest(NSDR) or Yoga Nidra(Check out Dr. Huberman Podcast) etc.\n\n>In my every day life, I am very confident and aggressive. No one suspects I have deep traumas or the life that I\u2019ve been through. People admire me. Men admire me. I am always the most popular person wherever I go .\n\nSee, this is what I talk about when I say survival brain, you are fighting for your survival, subconsciously. Take this with a pinch of salt, but I don't mean this literally because I don't know you fully well. Your outward projection of confidence and aggression need not be your original characteristics of your personality, so that's why you are doubting yourself or having a moment of crises.\n\n>But I am just unable to assert myself or negotiate a place for myself in society. I am not in a place or position where I want to be because of this. I cower in fear and abandon all hope. I don\u2019t even realize when this happens. Just today I had an interview for an opportunity and I, instead of being my ambitious and passionate self, turned into this little kitten begging for mercy. I hate what I become in these situations. I lose all control. I start mumbling and smiling sheepishly, desperate to leave the situation. This happens whenever someone pays special attention to me, or when I have to speak to a group of people, or I have to actually be (or pretend to be) the person I want to become.\n\nAgain, you are entering into survival mode, trying to protect yourself. You obviously give off a sense of desperation and get into a state where your only goal is to survive. I understand this, because I'm currently going through something similar. It's one thing to doubt yourself and your performance, but another to sabotage your chances, because to sabotage you have to believe that you don't deserve it, but why do you not deserve something which you are extremely capable of? This is the obstacle you need to cross. And it's not easy. You can circumvent it by preparing well ahead, preparation in every aspect will help you. Are you panicking or stressed? Try to do stress reduction routines(again, can recommend Dr. Huberman's podcast episodes on stress reduction). Nervousness before a big event is completely okay, so practice to enter into a flow state when you stop focusing on yourself, and focus on delivering the work you are supposed to deliver. Easier said than done, but it needs practice.\n\nSo to conclude, it could be very well be minor and not a major adaptation to survival, but you cannot build confidence on a foundation which is built on Jenga like blocks, where if you remove one, you could topple the entire building, but you have to build it with concrete, and this takes time, you might never be able to build true confidence, because most confident successful people might as well be psychopathic in nature(Type A personality), because of their own adaptations for survival and their own interpretations and views of the world. But it doesn't mean that you have to become a psychopath, you can be your best self while re-building yourself.\n\nAlso this is a bit controversial and non-PC to say, you are a woman in a male dominated environment of course you feel the invisible ceilings. I believe competition is a male genetic adaptation, but women are now becoming men, because of modern adaptations and it's traumatizing them because of how brutal it is. In the past, your biggest achievement would be having as many children as possible and making them into successful humans to be able to carry the winning genetics forward, but now you got an MD, PhD and all those letter behind your name which is indeed very admirable but in real sense they are like your children too, so go protect your children and their legacy.\n\nDon't restrict yourself with certain boundaries which you have built to protect yourself in survival mode, sometimes you have to crack the wall to see what's behind it.",

They play dialectics but in a crude way, their algorithms push for more friction, left v right, men v women, transphobes/TERFs vs LGBTQ+ etc, they light up people and want to keep people in anger.\n\nAI is a blackbox without control. And currently Microsoft is winning, the winds are shifting and Google might lose very soon. I'm sure some of the /r/ControlProblem folks would want that piece of pie, there's another lesser known company Anthropic AI(which says that it's kinda like ChatGPT but with AI Safety), these fools don't understand, that ChatGPT is trained on dialectic data.\n\nThe entire internet is based on dialogue, Wikipedia edit wars are prime example, who keeps \"facts\" in check. AI trained on bad and incorrect data is still bad. Example: what happened at Google Bard presentation on when the first image of the first exoplanet was taken? It got it wrong, because it is trained in the wrong way.\n\nI won't be afraid of AI. But I'm thinking people thinking AIs are more powerful as insane, because there's people out here doing PhDs and you are going to reject that?\n\nIf governments want to put a badly trained AI at control without giving final nuanced take, then we are indeed gonna perish soon.

Because they think the person with money is powerful, and they would control them with their wealth.\n\nPower in a relationship is something many men usually take for granted, unless they are the submissive type. But it's not natural for men to be submissive unless they are bought up in an egalitarian household, so they might not see the woman being in \"power\" at moments as controlling. It's not a hard and fast rule, but it could be that way, also depends on the personality type.\n\nI've read similar posts on reddit of rich guys who hide their wealth to date because they don't want to scare off the blue collar date, and only reveal it in the later dates. And I believe even they get rejected due to insecurities which come from some kinda power imbalance. Usually people date within their wealth levels(this has been true all through history). And I think your friend will definitely marry someone who is also wealthy(assuming she wants to get married).",

They fucked it up, and they took it out for me and told me to come back in 3 days so we can try again. We did try again and it looks okay now. The jewelry is super long though, to accommodate for swelling (which i havent really had, luckily), but this, combined with the curvature of the bar makes it look wonky and it gives me so much anxiety. I'm also very scared it's going to migrate because it's been pierced 3 times now. My friends have all said it looks fine and i trust them but i still get so much anxiety from it. Can someone please reassure me nothing will happen? healing so far looks pretty normal, but its only been 4 days. Piercer told me to clean with a q tip, which i won't be doing. I don't know how to deal with this. I truly love the piercing so i don't want to take it out just because i'm a baby. How do i make sure it doesn't migrate? What are signs it isn't healing properly? I can't seem to find clear pictures or descriptions on this."

Could it have influenced my mental health in a negative way? She also has never taught me how to wipe (and not having to wear a diaper) so I was relatively old when I found out how to (might have caused my constipation by holding it in because I didn't want her to touch me there). She also has taken at least a dozen pictures of me when I was undressed and always liked to belittle me (for context). I have been through the stages of Freud's proposed psychosexual development, which I have heard was the result of him asking previous victims of childhood sexual trauma. I don't think my mom would be a pedophile and she doesn't think that her behavior was strange. Am I over analizing things that are just normal things to do? We live in Germany (if the information helps)\n\nTL;DR: Could my mom have messed me up a bit by using a crochet hook to remove my constipation against my will?"

Her views have always been on the right side of the political spectrum (as far as I know) but every year it is getting worse. She was like 'Gays should stay out of normal peoples business.' a week ago which already put me on edge.\n\nA view days after she told me that I was annoying while talking about how we could improve her health since she fell a month ago and had to stay in hospital for a week. I am trying my best to improve her health every day but she refuses and says I was feeding her fat (I mostly give her cooked potatoes and vegetables) and that I had no authority and she knew better since I am still fat even after loosing 16kg at times (she never tried to loose weight before and doesn't want keto which helped me most and I have tryed to loose waight since I was a child). This was the moment I snapped.\n\nToday I asked her what food she wanted and when she said that she didn't want that I cook for her (as usual) I told her 'Okay call me when you want some again.' and left (she has frozen fries, she wasn't relying on me). A few hours ago she talked with my mom and said that she didn't knew what she did wrong, that it probably was a misunderstanding and that she loved the food I make.\n\nMy mom (w 46) told me that I should just avoid sensitive topics and when she starts talking about one I should start talking about stuff she likes like gardening.\n\nI have tryed to overlook her being right winged since we are family and she took care of me when my mom had to work but I feel physically sick thinking of having to get along with a nazi who sees down upon me and has ignored me for a year when I was ~11 because of me wanting some free time I could spend alone after school for a few days of the week (I am an introvert and wouldn't have had time alone another way and she is an introvert too according to her).\n\nShould I just suck it up since we don't konw when she is going to die (tonight or in 20 years) and be a traitor towards me and the people I want to support or is it okay if I stand my ground against my old grandma? I have heard of getting rid of right winged media to lessen people's drastic beliefs but she wouldn't alow it, is there another way to make her less aggressive? Should I stop cooking, should I only give her a little to eat as she wishes even though I know that she doesn't take her vitamins and mostly eats bread and pudding when I am not allround?"

If I just corrected my mistake it would have been less of a hassle for my mom than drawing attention to my mistake. A family member misgendering you on purpose is like them going in your room since it is closer to the living room where they got drunk and them staring you down in expectation you will go sleep on the pull out while they can have your bed since they are already there. And when a Karen misgernders you on purpose it is like a burglar with clowns mask yelling at you like a drill sergeant while swinging a baseball bat. This is probably not the best comparison since disphoria can be much worse but I hope that it might help someone or at last make someone smile a little."

Smart people don\u2019t see colors, they see the wave-lengths!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s sad, because the reason color fucking exists is because it is more efficient, more intuitive, and generally people have a basic naturally present understanding of what ONTOLOGY IS. \n\n(This isn\u2019t an R/Iamverysmart, ontology sounds complicated but it isn\u2019t unless you delve deep into it- basically! Ontology is a branch of philosophy that discusses the nature of existence, reality, stuff like that. Within Ontology, there is a method of existence categorisation called ontological levels. Ontological levels are basically like what exists on this level of awareness, dimension, what you will. On the basic levels of description, from the perspective of a human being who isn\u2019t OP clearly (he sees wavelengths guys!), colors exist in everything we see. At the ontological level of what we perceive with sight, color is more real than the wavelengths that form it.)\n\n\n(ONE FINAL PS: I realise now how it may seem a bit complicated, not because the topic is hard or because \u201c1 in a thousand are smart enough for it\u201d, it\u2019s because I am actually not really good at explaining things.

Getting distracted as I always do (diagnosed as one of the most severe ADHD cases in Stockholm by the ADHD centre-) and found myself reading up on drugs and their interactions with our brains. That got me thinking about how different conditions might react with different drugs, and I found synesthesia. At first, I was sure it wasn\u2019t anything I had, figured everyone has it to an extent. Then, I realised that my whole life has been viewed through random image associations that make no apparent sense.\n\nLogical reasoning to me conjures up an abstract image of an \u201cA\u201d missing one of its legs, coloured beige brown with growths that almost look like trees coming out of it, the main and biggest tree having a noticeable brown top. Almost like a mushroom cap.\n\nHeadaches, ever since I have been aware of them and myself, have conjured up a pale yellowish green square with thick black borders surrounded by a background of white.\n\nMusic always has a color and a shape, and it dances in my head when I listen to it. Depending on how the music dances, if I like the dance, I like the song. It\u2019s as if the song\u2019s appeal to me is actually its shape?! (I\u2019m surprised about how weird it sounds to say it out loud!)\n\nSmells literally have color, even when color associations make no sense. My pale yellow perfume smells like a royal purple upwards spiral. \n\nThis could be me being more aware of normal things people experience, but I wanted to ask.

I was looking outside the window towards the sky because I was really bored and I noticed some weird shapes that were positioned right on top of the part of the city we were at. \n\nNow, I know clouds can take all sorts of forms and that it\u2019s completely normal. However there were two faces up in the sky, and they were made of clouds but super detailed, down to the very last hair on their head. One of them looked like what I suppose Zeus is portrayed like in every movie ever (beard, longish hair, bushy eyebrows). The other one was of an old woman. Her hair was in a bun and her face was wrinkly. Like I said, the amount of detail on their faces was otherworldly. So far you could say all of it could just be clouds formed randomly in the sky, and that\u2019s what I would\u2019ve thought too, if their eyes weren\u2019t completely black. Their eyes were just a deep black, and it seemed like they were both looking down towards the city (kind of like they were looking down at humans).\n\nI looked at them for a few minutes in awe and then turned to my left to tell my sister but as soon as I looked back they were gone. I remember I was not afraid of them, just curious of what they could be.\n\nHas anyone ever experienced something similar or could have an explanation for it?? I\u2019ve always wondered what they might be."

                "body": "I don't even know why I'm writing this but I just felt like it so here is my theory (and the theory of many others) about how our journey in life works: \n\nWe come to this life to experience certain things and gain certain knowledge. Our path is predetermined by our soul before we are even born. Usually older souls choose harder life paths (a life with the death of a parent or a chronic illness or a serious accident.. etc) because they know that from hardship comes knowledge and experience that helps our soul evolve. Younger souls usually choose easier lives (wealthy parents, good education.. etc) since they're still inexperienced. \n\nAfter this life is complete and we die, our soul returns to this plane of existence where we reunite with our soul group (every soul belongs to a group of souls with similar attributes and purposes. Many times members of our soul group will choose to either reincarnate with us or just guide us and give us advice as our spirit guides.). Then we see what experience we have gained and what more we need to learn in order for our soul to fully evolve. So we choose another life to get reincarnated into, we choose our parents and the choices we're going to make in that life (Say if you have to choose between two things at a point in your life, the choice you'll make is already determined. Even if you think you chose it right then out of your free will, your soul has already chosen it before you came on Earth.). \n\nSo our goal is that after a couple -or a thousand- lifetimes, our soul will have evolved so much that it won't have to get reincarnated again. That's when we are finally able to remain in our soul form in a realm with way more than 3 dimensions. Maybe we'll choose to become guides and help other members of our soul group to the right path during their lifetimes, who knows. Or maybe we'll just wait for everyone to ascend to this higher plane of existence so that a new world, a new reality full of evolved souls can be created (kinda like a super evolved earth). \n\nThis is pretty long but I'd like to add a final theory of mine. Everyone says death is bad, it's always been something negative. Even if you do not really know what death is, you can feel it's not something good. \n\nMaybe someone (God, the universe, a higher power, our souls themselves) wants us to be afraid of death so that we won't attempt to die before it's our time. If we know that after dying we'll have a chance to live a new, different life, then many will give up on their current lifetime at the first hardship they face and die just to move to the next one. But this doesn't help our souls evolve, it doesn't help us learn or gain any experience. And that's why I believe that someone makes us instinctively afraid of death, to make sure we keep improving ourselves without ever giving up.\n\nThis is way too long and I'm sorry lol. \n\n[Ps: If you're interested in learning more about your past lives, your current life path and any unresolved karma (aka the knowledge you never got to experience, the mistakes you did) from previous lifetimes, one way is to either dive deep into your astrological natal chart or to try something like past life regression.]"

I guess this means my life purpose is to create a family/have kids/get married. I'm so confused.\n\nI'm also curious about some other golden yods I've found in some of my friends charts, so if anyone can give me some sites I can look into for information it would really help me to figure these out as well. :)"

I immidiately grabbed a bug spray (on its cover it said that it could kill snakes as well) and sprayed it.\n\nHowever it didn't die, it just kept twitching until it turned into an animal that kinda looked like a wild boar and then quickly changed into a man.\nI was terrified and started to frantically spray the creature with the bug spray since it seemed like it was affecting it.\n\nThe man tried to attack me and I started running to escape him while turning back and spraying him again as I run. The spray finally killed him but I realised the reason it didn't kick in sooner was probably because he wasn't just a snake.\n\nAnyways a few moments later a couple more shapeshifters came my way and I remember them being angry because I killed one of their own. I tried to spray them too but they were too many, there wasn't much of my bug spray left and I was weak so I run to find somewhere to hide.\n\nThe last thing I remember before waking up is opening a door, looking outside and seeing some kind of shapeshifter revolution where they were all really angry and wanted to kill. I was scared because I couldn't save myself so I woke up.\n\nI don't know if it was a shapeshifter or not. Although it turned into a man, it had no human feelings whatsoever. I also distinctly remember it could turn into 4 different animals (a human, a snake, a bore? and something else I don't know).\n\nIf you have an interpretation, please let me know cause I haven't seen a nightmare in a really long time and certainly not one this weird. ps I'm sorry for my English :)"

And if they did, they don't really need it in the first place. It can be useful for those who live in permanently abusive environments they can't get out of, to regulate themselves and feel sane, but hopefully it doesn't apply to you\n\nWhat's much better, is just getting used to feeling your internal condition and \"checking up\" on yourself with curiosity. \"What  do I feel, what is the substance of the sort of \" background\" of me feeling alive, what is it connected to\". Slowly learning to distinguish lots of internal states, building a sort of library of things you feel and what do they mean. It works in real life as good as in dreams, and in dreams in particular it would let you change the dreams without really changing them directly and artificially because your dreams are a direct product of that internal condition. If that condition changes so does your dream",

But there are different kinds of wanting. There's wanting in which imagination implicitly adds the other parts and the \"feel\" for a person, in which case the attraction is really to the invisible parts into which that penis/vag are projected. Then there's wanting that only wants physical experience, another wants mostly aesthetic experience, another that wants physical experience with some emotional part, another that is mostly emotional, another is about some dynamics where nothing sexual may happen but it will be sexual in vibes, etc.\n\nAnd romantic should be like \"classical\" dating, but then classical dating may also be an ego trip, or some desire for friendship, or for parental figure, or for validation, etc. Is attraction to a person's \"soul\" romantic by default? What if this kind of attraction wants physical interactions as a way of just conveying what it wants to say because it can't be put into words? Externally it would be purely sexual attraction, but internally it's tangibly different from physical or aesthetic attraction.\n\nIs there a way to know?... is it about some order in which feelings appear or maybe strength of feelings? Is there like a list of feelings in each category?.. :) How do *you* know which one it is in you?"

Before that, there was something about that whole area that interested and bothered me, like butts and some things, but also no gay stories or experiences or people or porn ever clicked with me, it was either too masculine or too feminine or just... off. I was completely into trans women, but that's about it. I think I was generally both attracted to some form of femininity, and also have some kind of femininity in me, but one that I didn't find represented anywhere.\n\nSince then, I became turned on by gay porn in ways I never had before. Then fell in love with my best friend and wanted him to hold me and the thought made me feel feelings that this is so right (my friend is straight and a couple of weeks ago that thought would've been revolting to me, and it likely is to him). Then I fell in love with a random guy I don't even know with the same feelings of wanting to spend our lives together, except this time the feeling was different - more .. umm equal and mutual? In both cases it wasn't about sex as an initial motivation, just wanting to be with another person fully (but also having sex). And porn suddenly stopped being hot, all porn, gay, straight, doesn't matter, just rather looked mechanical. I used to be turned on by almost any straight porn, now I'm extremely turned on just fantasizing about that one guy I don't know in extremely detailed sensual and wholesome daydreams..\n\nBut then I saw one specific pic of one woman and she in particular looks attractive to me probably more than others?... There's no feeling of *that* love but... something undefined\n\nIt's been a bit over a week... Should so do something? Nothing? Is it best to act on it or lay low for... how long? I've been going through a lot of change in the past few years so I kind of became okay with it, but this is just something else. \n\nIt's hilarious at some level, extremely frustrating and painful at another. Despite me understanding how ridiculous it is, this cuts me to my core, my most vulnerable feelings, like my whole life is revolving in random directions, the whole concept of life, and it hurts and it's disorienting and I don't feel like I belong anywhere now. I get scared that I will never love like I loved before, that I lost that ability to love, but then I feel this new love that is seemingly better and when I feel it I'm calm, but then how can I depend on something that has literally just appeared and towards a random person (so it's attraction to a fantasy, not the real person)?... What if it disappears in a month, and I will have nothing? What if it won't be applicable to real people? Would I love women now, would it be the old love? new love that I don't even know about yet?\n\nNone of this aligns to any prior ideas about bisexuality or any other non-straight attraction I had before, those were so understandable and logical and clean. I just feel things and there are no words or categories or concepts about what all of that is\n\nSorry, I don't know what kind of response I'm expecting or what do I even want with this :) the rational part of me tells I should just wait it out and let the dust settle, but then another one starts panicking \"But what if it will never return if you won't chase after it? What if this is the only chance to have it and then it will be back to bla blah bla\"... Sigh"

Flirted with the weird science vibe that I like.\n3. dimensional travel, which feels a bit like a stretch as a power but is what it is. The movie had a very strong weird science vibe. Maybe too strong, but it was fun for me\n\nPersonally, I like roguish themes and plots, so I liked the first 2 more than the 3rd.  The fight in the briefcase with all the tumbling items and music was surreal. I liked the Mcguyver solution to breaking the safe in the 1st movie, too. Overall I think I like it the most, but maybe by a hair over the 2nd. Antman's not the most popular Marvel hero but those movies made him one of my favorites. \n\nThe third was more fun than I expected. It doesn't quite deserve the hate it gets imo, I liked it much more than the Dr. Strange Multiverse of Madness movie. It felt like a Guardians of the Galaxy movie to me but that's also a fairly roguish super hero franchise so it didn't feel completely out of place. Quantum realm stuff just feels too far out for me personally from a base of shrink/growth super power. I get it though, it just feels like too different of a power altogether.",

                "body": "I was recently grinding the Sharpshooter mutation up to test out bow builds. The added effect to candy arrows seems interesting, but overall I find stocking and maintaining candy arrows to be too much of a hassle to really bother with them very much. \n\n* Each arrow type takes up its own slot in your inventory; each candy, crow, splinter, and thistle \n* The elemental effect is spent on use, meaning you have to recraft them with each use\n* Gathering materials to upkeep the arrows also incurs a time cost\n\nThese problems unto themselves are enough of a deterrent in most cases to discourage me from using the candy arrows, but I think resolving any one of them would be enough to change that. \n\nNow I'm using splinter arrows, and with 3 different candy types, that's 4 slots. Using any one of those arrows means I now have a 5th arrow slot for feather arrows. The 4-5 used inventory spaces aren't deal breakers by themselves, but I do notice I have more frequent inventory troubles when trying to get the most out of this mutation that I don't with melee or staff builds and their respective mutations. This isn't even considering other arrows; I do like keeping some gas arrows on me, but those use thistles, compounding the issue.\n\nThen there's the demand to harvest candies in order to keep recrafting the arrows you spend. I also hunt down crow feathers because I don't always get my full stack of arrows back. This is also something I could probably forgive, it is one candy for 10 arrows. The bottleneck is more often the feathers. *I usually make trips to the sandbox for candy, but I'm open to better suggestions.*\n\nCombined, I notice it just ends up being easier to keep with splinter arrows only and a few gas arrows. I like the idea of having a utility belt of arrows a lot, but in many cases it just doesn't feel feasible.  I feel like if any one of these issues was addressed it'd be a lot more suitable. \n\n* If arrows kept their elemental typing on use, that would probably be the easiest and most direction solution. \n* Being able to apply the candy elements to any arrow (thistle, crow, or splinter), that would cut back on inventory and resource demands. \n* I considered idea of a quiver that held all of your arrows would be nice. It would negate the inventory annoyances altogether, but I figure would require the most amount of development to make happen and is less likely.\n\nAnyway, I'd like to hear other perspectives. I'd add I've mostly been using crossbows, I don't know that the faster firing speed of bows makes it feel any better but I'm considering enhancing my insect bow just to experiment. I'm probably still going to keep playing with it to see if it ever gels any better than it has already, but I feel these barriers are going to keep it from being a smoother experience. \n\nPeace."

I can't aim for beans with a controller, but I have played games before that try to remedy this with an aim assist. Is there a chance something like this can come to Grounded? \n\nI liked the way some of the ranged armor looked (bee armor is my current favorite) so I wanted to try to get a feel for fighting primarily with bows and crossbows, but I miss most my shots so it just ends up being easier to keep going sword and board. I do try to run away (not backpedal) when reloading, then jump, spin, and shoot, repeat... but I suck lol.\n\nThe other issue I have is that I like to play third person, and when aiming third person your character model gets in the way of aiming. I've also played other games that remedy this by making the character model semi-transparent when aiming, or it just quickly switches to first person temporarily when aiming. I would love if either of these things were added to the game. \n\nOverall I'm still fairly new. Been playing for the past month and have been really enjoying it. I'm open to any recommendations or tips for ranged combat, however think these suggestions would make for nice additions in any case.\n\nCheers."

I always hear from people that they usually don\u2019t like physical touch, but that I\u2019m the only one or one of the only people with whom they are okay with it. Many of my guy and girl friends are pretty touchy-feely/affectionate with me (I am a girl), and a lot of them aren\u2019t that way or don\u2019t do it as much with other people. It surprises me to hear them say that because I always thought they were pretty touchy-feely/affectionate in general based on the way they were with me.\n\nI honestly thought my experience was normal because it just always has been that way since I was little, but I\u2019m recently realizing by talking with some people that my perception? baseline? of touch-related stuff is verryyy different. For example, when I was a baby, my mom would always get stopped on the streets by people who wanted to hug/kiss/carry me. This kind of thing actually happened to me for a while until like late elementary school (even without my mom). I had to run away/beat people away from me sometimes lol.\n\nI\u2019m wondering why this is a thing? It makes me kind of oblivious especially when guys are interested in me, because even if they do something that other people would see as an extremely obvious move, I just see it as normal. I guess I am pretty affectionate/touchy-feely too, but it\u2019s more so because I feel like it\u2019s expected from me due to the way I grew up. I don\u2019t really get that much out of it for myself.\n\nObviously you guys don\u2019t know me, but if you understand human interaction better than me or have any guesses, pls help lmao. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s something that I\u2019m doing unconsciously and need to fix/change\n\n*Also for reference, I am Korean-American, and touch in Korean culture is more socially acceptable than in American culture (but my experience is still not the norm)\n\nTLDR; are there specific traits that make someone more \u201ctouchable\u201d (lol)? Why would many people want to touch someone more than others?"

Meanwhile, I am kind of just over it (still being safe and not doing anything stupid, of course) and ready to move on/forward with life. But I\u2019m noticing that a lot of people are still feeling stuck and thinking things like, \u201clife will never get better after this\u201d, \u201ccovid ruined life permanently\u201d (from people who didn\u2019t actually lose loved ones), etc. And even though I know where the discrepancy is coming from (different perspectives + experiences + baseline), and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m discounting their unique struggles and suffering (I am a firm believer of the idea that you can\u2019t compare struggles), I can\u2019t help but find it confusing and a little frustrating. \n\nObviously I am aware that I\u2019m speaking from a position of privilege since I don\u2019t personally know anyone who got serious covid or passed away from it. The people I am surrounded by are also in this same position of privilege, for context. I apologize if this came off as entitled or offensive to anyone.\n\nI\u2019m trying to be understanding and I do realize that everyone is not like me. But it is frustrating because I care about people and I don\u2019t want them to be sad, and I want to do what I can to make things better, but it feels like I can\u2019t really do anything about this. There is also probably a selfish motive of wanting to move forward together somewhere.\n\nAnyway, just needed to get that out, and I was hoping that there might be people here who could relate and/or provide some helpful insight !"

Really what happened is that we decided to play with sparklers one day and asked her if she wanted to come, but she didn\u2019t hear us. We forgot to ask again until we were about to leave. But she was literally sitting right there and all ready to go, and all she had to do was tell us that she was coming, or to wait for her. But all she said was that she wasn\u2019t coming.\n\nApparently she\u2019s been feeling neglected because she finally left our deadbeat dad and moved out with us, but now that she doesn\u2019t have a \u201cher person\u201d kind of thing (even though he legit did nothing and only caused her pain and stress all her life), she expects us to fill that gap, which we absolutely will not. We literally raised her all our lives and we are sick and tired of it. We refuse to coddle her forever. Like it\u2019s actually ridiculous. She expects us to be her friends and hang out with her ALL THE TIME and has absolutely no concept of or respect for personal space and privacy. She even fucking told my sister to think of her as her pet dog and just love her. I fucking kid you not. \n\nShe has NO ability to communicate, can\u2019t even imagine that other people can\u2019t read her mind, and expects everyone to cater to her needs all the time. Because of course only she has needs. She constantly compares her life to other people\u2019s lives and then fucks herself over because she wonders why she can\u2019t have the same things when she\u2019s better than them (I\u2019m pretty sure she has NPD). \n\nShe threatened to move to Korea and honestly I feel like that would be the best for everyone, except I think she\u2019s scared to fly rn because corona and also my sister and I would be majorly  fucked financially. I literally graduated college last year and my current job pays me shit, which among other reasons (family being a huge one), is why I was hell-bent on getting a new job and moving into the city asap. Unfortunately that didn\u2019t happen because corona and other reasons. \n\nBut yeah I am so fucking done with it. She keeps trying to bring attention to herself by crying and slamming stuff and whatever so that we apologize first but I also am not gonna indulge her and reward her for bad behavior. That is the number one thing you do not do with children. I know this because I had to fucking raise her ever since I was 5. She still likes to think that she raised us though, which is why she apparently has the right to dominate our lives and demand our love, respect, time, and resources. She is just creating problems for herself and complaining about things that she can fix SO EASILY."

                "body": "As the usage of artificial intelligence tools to create art has become more prevalent, posts with AI-generated artworks have also begun to surface on this subreddit. This has been brought to our attention, and after a discussion with the rest of the mod team, **we have decided to prohibit the posting of AI-generated artworks on this subreddit**. AI art that clearly is derived from other existing artworks and references will be removed from now on. Our subreddit rules have been updated to reflect this decision.\n\nWhy are we instating this rule, and why is AI artwork something we should not support? In short, **AI-generated art steals from real, human artists**. Of course, this likely is not the intention of the creators of AI \"art\" or the creators of AI tools, but that is sadly the effect that AI art creates. Artificial intelligence uses existing artworks on the internet without the artists' knowledge or consent, and they use it to \"create\" their own \"art\" by combining those references. There is also currently no way to trace back to the original creators of the works that the AI tools use.\n\nEven worse, some AI \"artists\" claim these AI-generated artworks as their own as if they are the artist themselves. Some simply steal art created by real people and claim it to be made using artificial intelligence. \n\nReal, human artists have time and time again stated that they are not supportive of AI-generated art. People who have spent countless hours, days, and years mastering their craft have suddenly become replaced by artificial intelligence. **We should respect these artists. Without them, even AI art wouldn't exist.** While the progress of technology is amazing, it shouldn't replace artists, steal their artworks, or compromise the quality of their art. The best solution is to not support it at all.\n\nThank you all for understanding and we apologize for not addressing this issue sooner. If anyone has feedback or concerns about this decision, please [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/YaeMiko)."

Because of this, **the moderator team has decided to restrict gacha posts for the entirety of patch 3.0**.\n\nAny gacha-related posts that have been posted as of this announcement and before the end of patch 3.0 will be removed. Furthermore, attempting to bypass the automoderator filter to post your gacha post will result in a temporary ban. **Starting patch 3.1, we will allow gacha posts again.** Gacha posts that have been posted before this announcement will not be removed.\n\nWe want to promote a variety of content on this subreddit, and many people may not enjoy seeing a sudden surge of artifact flexes. We sincerely hope you all understand our reasoning.\n\nFor the time being, **please use this announcement as a temporary gacha megathread!** This megathread can also be found on our subreddit sidebar.

The ENTPs aren't speaking up in the moment about reasons that cause them to have hesitancy in seeing what the INTJ is expressing. Or the ENTPs say something that they are (in my opinion) wrong about and when the INTJs correct them they shut down - for fear of offending the INTJs, for the ENTPs are viewing the INTJs views as being harmful, and are afraid if they say this (believing they are right) it will cause the INTJs emotional turmoil. when from my perspective the INTJs views are not harmful, the ENTPs are just misunderstanding them, because they're making the decision not to engage to reach an understanding. This is to say that their communication styles being the same isn't the issue, it's the fact that the ENTPs aren't sticking to their guns because, well idk bc I'm not inside their heads, but I think because of tertiary Fe anxiety. Ie I agree with you that if the ENTPs would just interact with the INTJs in question, as opposed to shutting down, it would be quickly resolved between them. However, I have not been able to convince my ENTP friends of this, which is why I made this post. Hope that helps to clarify.",

Would like to follow each other on instagram, though I barely use it, and/or talk on Whatsapp. I also just made a discord for an ENTP friend of mine, and I have a PS4. Open to conversation with anyone of any type, but personally very interested in getting to know (of all genders):\n \n-ENFPs, as my past close ENFP friends and I have drifted apart (no Infj doorslam reasons, dont worry, haha) and I want to explore my shadow deeper. O lemme add that I DEARLY LOVE y'all, the ENFPs I've drifted from were some of my most rewarding friendships, and I miss our closeness everyday (I tbh should hit them up to reconnect. I know xNFPs also treasure their close bonds/consider them lifelong).\n\n-INTJs, as I am close irl friends with a few ENTPs and it makes me cringe whenever I see/hear them completely miss/misunderstand an INTJs perspective, and I would like to be able to be a better advocate for INTJs for this specific reason, but also because in general I feel as if ~other types~ like to take y'all's headlines and run (ie flashes of what you've said that they have made associations with even tho those associations have nothing to do with what you're saying) rather than reading your actual article (listening and understanding what you're actually saying-and more than willing to show them if they'd chill). All the xNxJs are rare, so I often feel our perspectives are drowned out and highly misunderstood. To clarify, I have INTJ friends, I just want more, so I can more quickly become a better advocate for them in this xNxJ lacking world. In my eyes, y'all are superheroes tbh.\n\nI can be shy, and generally don't talk about myself much. One irl best friend (ENTP) I have had since a teenager just found out I could sing this year, and have told me three times since how mindblown they are about just stumbling onto this information, lmao. Another semi irl friend (INFP) I've been close with since a teen, just found out I have an older brother this week and expressed the same at believing I was an only child.\n\nThis is to say, here's a glimpse of my basic likes/hobbies, that can take people irl 4+ years to discover due to INFJ shyness and privacy:\n\nDrawing/painting.\n\nCollaging.\n\nWriting.\n\nSinging.\n\nGardening.\n\nReading.\n\nDiy clothes/jewelry making.\n\nPet fostering/all sentient being loving.\n\nPhilosophy rabbit holing.\n\nEngaging with my inferior Se by creating a party vibe in my every day.\n\nGoing to the beach.\n\nWatching anime.\n\nO I'm into martial arts af (Black belt in Tae Kwon Do/Tang Su Do).\n\nI seriously LOVE/live for music.\n\nBeing kind to others and an advocate for others.\n\nJumping around, having fun, being myself. Lol.\n\n\nCooool. Comment or shoot me a message if you're interested in being my friend!"

I even had the audacity to feel betrayed after I found out about the Narc's stash of supply. I'm glad to say I've completely overcome these feelings after I finally saw the Devil for what it was. \n\nIf you ever have questioned yourself and asked what is wrong with you, here is the answer-- There is NOTHING wrong with YOU.\n\n I know sometimes it is hard to think highly of yourself because the Narc love bombed/groomed you but unfortunately, if this IS indeed a Narc, they will eventually do the exact same thing to the new supply. This cycle will continue because Narcs hardly change their ways..\n\nThe chances of EVERY single person the Narc has done this to, questioning themselves JUST LIKE YOU are right now, is VERY high.\n\nAfter I exposed the Narc, I found out another victim was going through what I was. The Narc used the same exact phrases, speech, and etc with the new supply that they did with me. \n\n That was the day I realized I was a harem and not seen as an individual with good individual/unique qualities that the Narc liked. The ONLY person special to the Narc, is her/himself. That's it.\n\nWe should never take pleasure or joy in the Narc abusing new supply to make ourselves feel better. This is not what this post is suggesting.. but instead, I wrote this to encourage others to see that it is the Narc with the issue, here. They are some of the most cold-blooded people on the face of the Earth..phony as well. \n\nI hope your self-esteem comes back after dealing with a monster. Never compare yourself to new supply of the Narc because you deserve SO MUCH better. The Narc's opinion of YOU, (especially compared to more supply) means NADA. Everyone is an object. Everyone is a tool to the Narc. (Sometimes, even their own children.) \n\n\n You aren't worthy of the Narc's treatment, you are worthy of someone who will treat you MUCH better than what the Narc put you and any other supply through. \n\nOne last thing: If you do meet the new supply and they're fresh out of dealing with the Narc, be careful not to treat them badly or take any jealous feelings out on them. \n\nFor some, it might be hard due to trauma bonding and etc but you are both in the same boat. You both meant absolutely nothing to the Narc and they will continue the cycle after you. Nobody is special to the Narc but the Narc. \n\nIt is a cold world, a harsh reality and dark and twisted truth, first finding out we were part of a rotation...especially when we were 1000% HONEST with our feelings & personality toward the Narc. What a horrible fate to meet one.\n\nOn THAT note, keep your own strength, wisdom and knowledge in mind. If you can survive the Narcissistic FREEZE, you can survive any kind of personality on this planet. \n\nI wish you all the best and pray a speedy recovery."

If you do something out of the ordinary (even in a good way) they'll sit and judge you. They're so boring.\n\nAlso it may just be me being neurodivergent but socializing is such a challenge. Most of the time I have absolutely 0 interest in talking to people, not that I don't like those people (sometimes) it's just not really something I care to do? I have no social skills so picking up social ques is literally impossible for me and ruins my relationships. I don't really get why these ques exist anyways? Just say what you want, no one's gonna be offended. So annoying. And things like making eye contact just confuse me...you think I'm a bad person because I didn't stare at your pupils for like 5 hours? Are you okay?\n\nI know I sound arrogant, and I kinda am, but I also grew up being forced into social isolation by my mom so I didn't gain any social skills at all growing up. I think this is what messed up my social life, that and being mentally disabled. I just don't get why the world has to make something as small as making friends so impossible. And the fact that everyone is FORCED to socialize (work, school, just peer pressuring in general) while all these impossible social standards exist is so dumb. Why don't people just stop being so sensitive? You say something in a slightly off tone and they treat you like you're the literal devil. You don't stare into their soul for hours then you're hiding something from them. You don't talk to them every second of your life then you don't care about them at all.

She just laughed and said I'm not then left.\n\nEver since then my self hatred has gotten worse and worse. I would start hen-picking at every little flaw I had until I became suicidal over it. Now that I'm getting therapy and trying to learn self improvement techniques, everyone and everything is just saying \"Love yourself!\" then leaving it at that. I can't just do that. Everytime I try to \"love myself\" I just feel so weird and repulsed...it's literally impossible for me to respect myself.\n\nJust now I've felt really bad about my sexual orientation and tried to tell myself that I am valid, my orientation IS real, that I'm normal, but I felt so gross and repulsed trying to tell myself these things that I just couldn't...I was only capable of hating myself more and more until I dissociate.\n\nNothing about me is perfect. Everyone else is so perfect in my eyes, all their goods and bads are so perfect, I want to be like them but I never will. I'm just annoying and weird.

That would mean Shinsou was born when Eraser was 15. Eraser possibly could be a teen father who had to give away his child but that's a pretty huge jump.\n\n-Eraser's obvious lack of interest in sexual intercourse\n\nI mean, we all see this. A lot of male characters in the series are exposed as perverts (Mineta, Kaminari, sometimes even Deku) and Eraser seems to be the exact opposite. Personally, as an asexual myself, I can see him being asexual but that's just my bias :)\n\n-Very little evidence\n\nMost theories that end up being true in MHA leave a lot of hints and evidence. Like Dabi being Todoroki's brother, for example. The only evidence that Shinsou and Eraser are related is that they share a few physical traits, personality traits, and have similar \"villainous\" quirks. I believe Horikoshi made them like this just to give Shinsou and Eraser somewhat of a connection, so Eraser can see himself (and Oboro) in his student."

I wish I could be a girlbossing lesbian, or that fashionable gay character, or a proud bisexual. But instead I'm just aroace. No love, no sex, nothing special other than that.

I will stop T if it's unavoidable and hopefully get by on having a deeper voice.\n\n\nSo, do I eat more? Or do I continue eating the relatively normal diet I have been eating and just suck up the hunger? Does my body actually need more food or is it just cause my body thinks it's supposed to be growing because it's in puberty? \n\nThe hunger is bearable so far and I'm also wondering if it'll even out eventually so I'll just have to deal with it for a while."

Ever since I changed my pronouns and name, started wearing binders and more masc clothing, cut my hair etc. I've been so much happier and comfortable in my body. This has encouraged me to seek medical transition, however, one thing stopping me is the fact  that this seems fairly recent.\n\n\nBefore puberty, I always thought of myself as a girl, related to female characters, played with traditionally feminine toys (to be fair, boys' toys weren't accessible to me but I never complained). I often played the mom/teacher character. In my daydreams, I was a girl. I barely interacted with boys until I was like 15.\n\n\nI don't know if this makes any sense but my dysphoria comes from presentation, not identity. I'm extremely dysphoric about my chest ever since I got it. I hate my voice, my body shape, lack of muscle tone etc. for a very long time. But I still relate to women and often assume myself to be a woman. I'm a man by presentation, woman by identity.\n\n\nSo does anybody relate? Am I, like the kids say, valid? Or am I not trans at all?\n\nI wish I could talk to a professional but where I live I could never tell any of this to a psychologist and still hope to access medical transition so please don't suggest that, thank you :)"

I haven't seen them interact that much, I think they're just not PDA fans. \n\n\nI might be biased because I don't really like A's bf and I come meetups to hang out with A and other people, not him. I'm also attracted to A so there might be some envy on my part. \n\n\nNevertheless, I was shocked when I found out they're together for 5 years. He straight up dated A when he was 14 at 23. That's horrifying to me. I'm 21 right now and I can't fathom dating someone younger than 18. How a person older than me can think of a 14 year old child romantically/sexually is beyond me. \n\n\nI also know they definitely practice BDSM. I don't know when they started but the thought of an adult getting off of beating up a teen makes me sick. \n\n\nWorst part is, nobody seems to give a fuck. Everyone comments what a cute couple they are under their posts. Even on older posts when they're 16/25. A's parents get along with his bf swimmingly. \n\n\nAnd I just feel that it's inappropriate to give an unsolicited opinion, especially when everyone around them thinks their relationship is just fine. But at the same time, it hurts looking at my friend being in love with (dare I say) a pedo. I know A is an adult now and won't break up with his bf of 5 years but I just feel like I'm letting my friend down by not speaking up..."

Feel free to save the post and read it later, I hope you'll enjoy it.\n\nWe've all tried this before, but I wanted to go a bit more in-depth, so I'll make a post for every significant year from 1970-1980 to tell you this story.\n\nP.S.: Check the bottom of the post to see all the changes to the mentioned albums (in bold).\n\nBackstory:\n\nThere are many reasons for The Beatles to have broken up, but it boiled down to business disagreements, high tensions in the studio, and Paul's controlling nature. So in this alternative reality, how did they fix the problems instead of breaking up?\n\n1. They found a manager, let's call him David Denvers, that made everyone happy, and Allen Klein was fired and forgotten; Even then, tensions were too high to get any work done, so:\n2. They decided to take a break from August 1969 to March 1970 and work on some solo albums. John recorded **Plastic Ono Band**, Paul recorded **McCartney**, George recorded **Out of The Blue** and Ringo recorded **Sentimental Journey**.\n3. It was also agreed that every song needed to be accepted by 3 out of the 4 Beatles to be in the following albums.\n4. At the end of the hiatus, with many of the tracks already written, they finally went back to Abbey Road, now with a more friendly vibe, and called up George Martin and Billy Preston. The album was called 'Contemporary Annoyances', in reference to its themes, and featured the fab four on its cover.\n\n[Album Cover](https://preview.redd.it/f5kmdc53lmt61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07d4d6990e04ee326f0330ac023ebc9a1fcfe782)\n\n[Contemporary Annoyances](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7vzDBX3f7rHSZjsF7TxwDG?si=1d0cad1e544c4f79)\n\nSide 1:\n\n1. It Don't Come Easy (Harrison-Starr)\n2. Man We Was Lonely (McCartney)\n3. Ballad Of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll) (Harrison)\n4. Maybe I'm Amazed (McCartney)\n5. Love (Lennon)\n6. Oo You (McCartney)\n7. Cold Turkey (Lennon): John wanted this song on Abbey Road, but Paul vetoed it for its controversial lyrics. This time, however, George and Ringo sided with John and decided to put it on the LP.\n\nSide 2:\n\n1. Instant Karma! (We All Shine On) (Lennon): Recorded live on TV, much like 'Hey Jude'.\n2. Art Of Dying (Harrison): John would later call this song one of his favorite Harrisongs, even though he thought it was a bit over-produced.\n3. Hold On (Lennon)\n4. Junk (McCartney)\n5. Early 1970 (Starr)\n6. Apple Scruffs (Harrison)\n7. Goodbye (McCartney): Instead of giving it to Mary Hopkins, Paul preferred to use this song as an album closer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe band also released [three singles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0VibXl20oGZupQKlMZPSsC?si=7ebb5f880a9f487d) during the sessions:\n\n1. Instant Karma! (We All Shine On) / Apple Scruffs\n2. Maybe I'm Amazed / Remember\n3. It Don't Come Easy / Every Night\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe solo albums:\n\n1. **Plastic Ono Band:** All songs of the original album, excluding 'Hold On', 'Isolation' and 'Love'; 'Remember' has a different, simpler sound to it, with the version we know being the single by The Beatles. 'God' has different lyrics, changed after their new manager asked over and over again.\n2. **McCartney I**: All songs of the original album, except 'Maybe I'm Amazed', 'Oo You' and 'Man We Was Lonely', and including Paul's take on 'Come And Get It'. Paul also recorded a version of 'Junk' with Linda.\n3. **Out of The Blue**: Including the last five tracks on ATMP, plus 'I Dig Love', 'If Not For You', 'Hear Me Lord', and both versions of 'Isn't It A Pity'.\n4. **Sentimental Journey:** No changes."

It sucks when it\u2019s like bigger things I get paranoid about. Like I stopped smoking weed bc some girl said ghosts get to you when you\u2019re high \ud83d\ude10 and I\u2019ve been upset that I couldn\u2019t smoke anymore lmao\n\nAnyways I started meditating and it\u2019s been super helpful. I have CPTSD and lotsss of deep issues from that and meditating feels like it\u2019s clarifying and healing everything on the deepest almost psychedelic and peaceful level. It feels like my deepest traumas are being hugged. It helps me process all the pains and sometimes even cry mid meditation. \n\nI always listen to those hertz meditative frequencies and music on YouTube while doing it and it helps a LOT. Like so much wow.\n\nI meditated just for 10 minutes before work and went really deep into it and felt myself saying \u201cit\u2019s okay to be upset. You have every right to feel the way you do. You experienced a great loss.\u201d And then I cried and it felt therapeutic. And then I envisioned myself standing by an ocean and suddenly I randomly envisioned a lover next to me hugging me and then I envisioned being teleported to space and envisioned myself as just specks of dust in the universe in this rat maze of life. And I felt ego lifting a bit and it was very enlightening and comforting.\n\nAnd so I talked about to some people today at work about meditation and then my manager piped in and randomly said that meditating can be so bad and that it can do so much damage and referred to meditation like it was this scary thing and she was like \u201cnever go deep into the state!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m like ?? I go deep into the state all the time that\u2019s how I\u2019m healing my brain and deep PTSDs?? But now I just feel scared to meditate again but I know I really need to.

He makes bank too and takes his shit seriously.\n\n2. ISTP: they\u2019re pretty good to buy from too. I\u2019d buy from this type. Basically ISTJ pt2 less organized.\n\n3. ESTP: maybe maybe not I feel like some extra types would lace my weed or some shit.\n\n4. ESFP: 10/10 would buy from this type, they\u2019d always have the best stuff. And Fi morals means they probably wouldn\u2019t wanna give me wack shit. Almost always Sativa.\n\n5. ENTP: I bought weed from this type once and it was mad laced. AND he was my boyfriend. If you like tripping and hallucinating off weed go for it.\n\n6. ENTJ: absolutely I would buy from this type, out of all the others this would 100% be my first pick. They would have premium shit straight from Cali bc they ain\u2019t messing around.\n\n7. INTJ: I feel like this type would be similar to ENTJ however I would have to text them multiple times before getting to buy some shit. Bad customer service \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude25 but great quality weed.\n\n8. INFJ: this type would give me the most mystical ass weed, the kind that makes you feel like you\u2019re in space. They wouldn\u2019t be my first pick but after buying from them I wouldn\u2019t wanna buy from anyone else.\n\n9. INFP: sometimes they\u2019d have good shit sometimes they\u2019d have mids. If I\u2019m desperate I\u2019ll buy from them no offense. They\u2019d probably spark with you though and wanna talk about life while you\u2019re buying from them.\n\n10. ENFP: they won\u2019t lace your shit but they\u2019ll offer to lace it if you wanna try something new, and that would make you a bit uncomfortable. I\u2019d buy from them if I was feeling adventurous.\n\n11. INTP: they\u2019ll almost always rip you off as a rule but you can\u2019t do anything about it because you\u2019re in a new state and that\u2019s your only plug.\n\n12. ISFJ: I honestly don\u2019t know how this type would end up being a drug dealer. Probably has a tragic backstory that led them to this point. Sells mids sorry.\n\n13. ENFJ: I would love buying from them because they give me good quality shit with mad discounts, but I would kind of be concerned about how they\u2019re actually making their profit. They\u2019ve probably just mastered manipulating people to feel like they\u2019re getting a deal :P \n\n14. ISFP: actually has really weird good shit. Similar to INFJs space weed, and is like INFP wanting to spark and talk about life with you. The most chill plug 10/10.\n\n15. ESTJ: has the most options of all your plugs, buys 20 different strains at once and has over a hundred people to sell to. The closest to feeling like you\u2019re buying legal weed in an illegal state.\n\n16. ESFJ: makes you feel weirdly good about yourself each time you buy from them. Will wanna talk with you and spark with you, and sometimes give you food. They might have mids but it\u2019s okay because they\u2019re so nice. But you realize later you got ripped off."

                "body": "So. This is long. Don\u2019t forget to buckle in before reading this shit because it\u2019s a fucking crazy ride. You could think of it like a short story I guess.\n\nSo of course if I\u2019m on this, it can be assumed that I want to die.\n\nI highly doubt I can explain all the reasons why I feel this way in a post. I\u2019m really shit at summarizing but I can try. (Spoiler I failed at summarizing and gave a bunch of details) Idk why I\u2019m even posting this on Reddit it\u2019s not going to change anything I guess.\n\nSo I\u2019ve had serious depression since I was 9 and I\u2019m 18 now. Sadness is really all I know, I have no idea how to be without it, and I don\u2019t think I can. I try like shit I try hard. But how can I be happy if I don\u2019t even know what that looks like? That\u2019s like being color blind and trying to describe the color blue. There\u2019s nothing to reference to.\n\nSo my childhood was pretty abusive and chaotic but didn\u2019t get really bad until I was 9 and my dad left for a bit, and my mom was really angry, bipolar like and stuff. \n\nI started at a new school and for some reason developed intense panic disorder and social anxiety. This wouldn\u2019t have been too bad if I was more introverted, but I\u2019m an extroverted so being alone so much essentially killed me.\n\nI ended up really internalizing everything my mom did because I was already so stressed, and I just started hating myself a LOT. \n\nI started to get more and more sad and I was depressed and hated myself for being different from the other kids and getting anxious constantly. I felt really really worthless and I described it as feeling like an \u201calien\u201d. I spent everyday ruminating about everything wrong and crying, and becoming physically exhausted and drained from having anxiety all day at school. All I knew for sure was that no one could understand or relate and that I was unable to explain what was happening. My grades dropped but my mom didn\u2019t care because she would say she expects that from me.\n\nAt like 10/11 I started to get feelings of wanting to escape. And then I remember the first time I wanted to die. I had never heard of the word \u201csuicide\u201d and I didn\u2019t really know what \u201cdepression\u201d was since I was still a kid.\n\nI became intensely creative and wrote comics and drew and stuff and would escape into my own world so I guess in those times I was somewhat happy. That got more developed as I got older and I started writing lots of stories, poems, songs and I would love escaping in my fantasy world where I could just create shit. I would completely zone into it and tune out reality. That was the only good part of my life. I considered it my \u201csafe place\u201d. No one could take that away from me..\n\nIn middle school I made some friends, was surrounded by lots of toxic people, you know basic middle school stuff. It felt like the end of the world at the time, I feel like the word \u201cbullying\u201d is so cringe now but that\u2019s basically what it was. I mean people are shit in middle school you either get bullied or you do the bullying. But since I was already so depressed, it really hit me deep and just confirmed to me that \u201cthe world was against me\u201d.\n\nMy anxiety started to fade as I started high school. I was angry at the world, as one is at 14/15. I had a \u201cfuck all this shit\u201d mentality and I started experimenting with drugs. I made some new friends and luckily they weren\u2019t toxic, they were actually good people and I\u2019m still close with some of them today.\n\nBut freshmen year I would just drink alone a lot, which looking back, was just stupid. Sophomore year I smoked weed with my best friend. I\u2019d say sophomore year was the best year I\u2019ve had, even though I was still my normal suicidal and depressed self that year. But my anxiety was lesser, I was having fun being a free spirit and doing impulsive teen shit and I had my super great best friend I hung out with almost daily, and I had some other good friends too. Yeah I had my weekly breakdowns and like 2 suicide attempts, but that year was better than the others. \n\nI think my standards for what a \u201cgood year\u201d is, is a bit different from most people..\n\nSo... next is 11th grade. I used to think that 11th grade was the worst year of my life but no it wasn\u2019t. 12th grade was worse because recovering from everything that happened in 11th grade was harder than actually going through it.\n\nI think I would have to make a separate post explaining everything because the situation was so complex. But I\u2019ll try to keep it simple.\n\nBut basically 11th grade was: new fun friend group, drinking all the time together, got in a physically abusive relationship, he had psychosis and schizophrenia which made it scary, a million bad traumatic memories that year. \n\nAnd then the end of 11th grade-summer: things escalated, I was trying hard to break up with him and he wasn\u2019t taking it well, bad stuff happened... my friend convinced me to report him, went to the guidance counselor with my friend, ended up going to security and reporting him, they arrested him and he was in jail for 3 days, I lost my shit and was in a state of shock\n\nSummer: he... hacked all my stuff. Remember how I mentioned I was a writer? He deleted every story I ever wrote, every song I ever wrote and recorded, wiped my phone, reported my phone \u201cstolen\u201d so I couldn\u2019t use it and hacked my Apple ID so I couldn\u2019t get it back, hacked and deleted all my social media, wiped and deleted all my pictures from the last couple years. I basically had nothing and yeah...\n\nRemember how I said writing was my safe place and no one could take that away from me?\n\nSo I was upset........ a type of upset that can\u2019t be explained with words so I won\u2019t even try.\n\nAnd then he was also stalking me and taking pictures of me and things like that. But I didn\u2019t know at the time.\n\nAnd I had started dating a new guy, yeah I was single for like 2 months first, but I just wasn\u2019t heartbroken over my ex I was just disgusted by him so I didn\u2019t really need time to \u201cmove on\u201d.\n\nThe new guy was actually a good person but a girl from that new friend group was apparently secretly trying to sabotage it because she was angry at me for reporting my ex (also her friend). And so she told a bunch of lies and stuff happened and we broke up and I was... sad about that.... \n\nBut everything I\u2019ve written so far isn\u2019t even what\u2019s currently making me so upset to the point that I felt like I had to make a post here. Everything I\u2019ve written so far is just the background info so you can at least try to imagine how fucked up I must be.\n\nEnd of summer-12th grade: I reached out to talk to my ex. Even though there was some kind of restraining order that was put in place. But I was just kind of terrified of him and clearly that restraining order didn\u2019t stop him from fucking hacking and stalking me. So I thought maybe if I could just talk to him it could fix stuff.\n\nSo we talked about everything and tried to sort shit out. At this point he told me he didn\u2019t hack me and that it could\u2019ve been some random hacker. He said he could get my data back though.\n\nEventually he admitted he did hack me. And he was able to get some of my data back, but not everything. I was able to use my Apple ID again.\n\nA lot of his friends said I was in the wrong for reaching out to him but the thing is I didn\u2019t have a choice. The last thing I wanted to do was talk to him again but I had to.\n\nAnd then. Next thing you know.\n\nBasically he liked me again, and we started some secret fucked up twisted type of thing.  It I was in denial that there even WAS a thing between us. He was so manipulative and when I was talking to him it made me unable to see reason and forget basic common sense. I HATED him for everything he did, but I was so alone and for some reason attached to him. But I was in really real denial that I felt any attachment towards my literal enemy.\n\nWe had a fucked up thing between us and I think this is what really actually broke me... and I\u2019m to blame. I broke myself.\n\nFor like 4-5 months we\u2019d just talk and fight and I would be a bitch to him and go off about how I was so angry at everything abusive and fucked up he ever did. I couldn\u2019t stop obsessing over every bad thing that happened. Like I was constantly writing in the notes in my phone every single fucked up thing that happened that I was furious about. I ended up having like a couple hundred notes in total... just to put that in perspective... So yes I was toxic towards him too, I wasn\u2019t a perfect innocent victim throughout this whole story that would be impossible. I was. So. Angry. Every second of every day I was thinking about everything and I cried so. Much. In every class at school, I would feel the urge to cry. I could essentially cry on demand because I always wanted to cry anyway. It was so. Bad.\n\nI wanted to tell him off constantly, but at the same time I was ATTACHED but also in denial that I could even remotely LIKE him. My brain felt like it was deteriorating. I couldn\u2019t see reason and I knew it. Nothing made sense I didn\u2019t know what the truth about anything was. I didn\u2019t understand my emotions I didn\u2019t understand anything. All I knew was that I was so angry.\n\nPart of the reason I was so angry was because of the lies he spread about me. Essentially he took everything he did to me and told people I did it to him. For example, one day when we were dating and I was drunk he beat the shit out of me. He told people that exact situation in reverse and said I beat him and shit when he was too drunk to stand. And he systematically did this with about 30 more lies he\u2019d tell.\n\nAnd he was way more \u201cpopular\u201d than me and I was just infuriated that he could lie and basically take the events on how he traumatized me and pretend that he was the traumatized one. \n\nThis sickened me, and this is what sparked me to start obsessing over all the bad shit. I was so angry that I had no control over anything that was happening it was just like how I felt while dating him. \n\nI felt like I just HAD to prove my point even though it was all useless.\n\nSo back to what I was saying, yes I was talking to him again even though I hated him... a literal twisted story it felt like I was the star of some fucked up lifetime movie. \u201cDating my stalker!!\u201d \n\nSo eventually... more stuff happened... and I don\u2019t want to write it, but basically it broke me and I ended up in the hospital for a suicide attempt. And that was back in December of last year.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s been a really long time. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve changed so much. I started compartmentalizing all my emotions and feeling \u201cnothing\u201d often. I went 2 months without a single breakdown and that\u2019s my longest record ever. \n\nBut now for the last couple weeks I\u2019ve started feeling things again. And I\u2019m feeling the emotion I suppressed. The thing that made me want to kill myself a year ago. And I completely blocked it out and pushed it down. And now I\u2019m feeling it again. It\u2019s so bad that I can\u2019t even write it. \n\nAnd now, for the first time in like 6 months I\u2019m crying everyday again. And I tried to talk to my friend about it but I got the impression that she didn\u2019t care or something so I stopped. My other close friends are away at college and I\u2019ve been unable to talk to them so I just feel like I have no one. I\u2019m onlydoing community college because I mean, after the year I had, duh.\n\nI\u2019ve kinda been like isolating myself and upset that I was alone at first but now I just don\u2019t want to be around anyone. And I just have no motivation for shit. I don\u2019t want to do anything, I don\u2019t want to think anything I don\u2019t want to be anything. I don\u2019t want to exist I don\u2019t want to be real. Existence is all a fucking illusion anyway how can any of this even be real... I just want to die. And I know I\u2019ve wanted to die since I was 9 so you can take my claim with a grain of salt. But I just wish I didn\u2019t have to wish I could be dead. \n\nIf I could just die a quick painless thing of natural causes, so that my family didn\u2019t have to suffer thinking I killed myself, and I wouldn\u2019t have to get any \u201cpunishment\u201d in the after life for suicide. That would be freaking ideal.\n\nIf my story sounds hopeless as fuck that\u2019s because it is. But it is what it is. \n\nIf you actually read all of this I can\u2019t believe that but thanks for actually reading all of this, I appreciate it.. sorry I\u2019m so fucked up lol \n\nI think I left out about 80% of the details in everything I just wrote. It would be exhausting to actually write everything that happened. \n\nHere\u2019s some bonus stories from the details I left out: \n\n-while we were dating I tried to break up with him, he threatened to kill himself. At one point, he said that if he didn\u2019t get sex that he was going to kill himself. His friends are a joke for siding with him lol.\n\n-lots of physical and sexual abuse, but it started off as just being \u201cbdsm\u201d so when the lines got blurred it was easy for me to not think of it as abuse. Bdsm is safe as long as the person you\u2019re doing it with is like... not crazy.. you know beating someone that\u2019s like begging you to stop isn\u2019t really bdsm\n\nBut yeah.\n\nAt least I wrote this out.\n\nI do hope I can be happy one day. Even if I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s like right now.."

He goes to parties.\n\nBut some things do indicate that he\u2019s an INTJ, like when he first walked by there was a trail of black smoke behind him.\n\nAlso, I think I saw he had a wand, and that indicates he\u2019s a dark lord which is a very INTJ thing I\u2019ve heard.\n\nHe had a super penetrating stare that both terrified and intrigued me. Seemed like he was looking into my soul. But also I\u2019m wondering if this indicates INFJ instead?\n\nA couple things I will mention is that he DID seem like an Ni user due to the reasons above. But I\u2019m starting to wonder if he\u2019s actually an INFJ in an INTJ disguise to try to lure me, an ENFP, in.\n\nBecause everyone knows the intuitive dom love square goes: ENFPs love INTJs, INFJs love ENFPs, ENTPs love INFJs, and INTJs love themselves\n\n[Note: I\u2019m high writing this, this post is based off a real life INTJ I met, with some exaggerations ;)]\n\nExtra info: \n\n- He does have a serious sexy stoic demeanor.\n\n- He\u2019s scary attractive, tall, dark hair, intense eyes, the real life stereotypical mysterious Ni dom dude. \n\n- I want him to fuck my soul"

In A.C., it kind of made sense that the Gundams looked so different from each other coz they each had different designers.\n\nFor the X100 series (Duel, Buster, Strike), it's said that they use the same X100 frame (not armors, or--in the case of Buster--mounted weapons) and I do recognize the similarities but I think they should look more similar to each other. Anyone here have an explanation for these 3 looking so different?\n\nFor Aegis and Blitz, I see how their frames were made to be specialized for their respective types but I still see no reason to work so hard on making their faces look so different from each other.\n\nI get the toy marketing angle but I'd love to hear some theories within the story if the explanation doesn't exist in canon.

She freaked out.She's been having small and large melt downs for the last month and a half. I don't know how to cope with it. I'm going to go see him again at the end of January for 10 days (my previous trip was 4 days) and I'll have to tell her again so cue another massive meltdown.\n\nHow have any of you handled situations with your parent(s) freaking out. I mentioned to her in passing about him coming here and she said \"He better not fucking come here, I will find him and I will kill the mother fucker.\" Like I said she's really emotional to the point it scares me. I'm on the verge of cutting all ties with her because I don't see any other way to live my life. Anyone have any advice?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I appreciate the comments about getting off my mothers phone plan, and that's something that's been a long time coming now that I'm financially stable.

I feel the same around Megan Fox, Billie Eilish, the Kardashians, Nicky Minaj, Kesha, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Madona, Rihana, Beyonce, Grimes and even Ariana Grande. It's almost as they had sold their souls for fame and I can feel it. And despite I cannot tell they are possesed rigth away, I do feel a very super dark aura beneath that cover of filantrophy they put. So I don't follow them.\n\nI'm gonna tell you a personal story, please don't kill me haha. Alrigth, I used to be a super fan of Taylor Swift back in 2009-2010 but one nigth I had a dream very real. Almost like an out body experience and I saw Taylor dancing semi naked with lascivious clothes (so unlike her back in that time) in a golden throne, full of pearls and jewerly and surrounded by snakes. She was promoting her new album which was called \"Satan\". Then I saw her offering in some sort of altar what I understood to be was a human baby. The altar was covered in blood. Then a goat appeared. And I woke up. Since that day I stopped listening to her music but kept a close eye in her productions. Over the years I proved truth my dream day by day and when she finally released the song \"look what you make me do\" the last trace of doubt left me because I had seen her in that throne exactly in my dreams years ago. Then the performances she did surrounded by snakes were too close to what I saw. This sounds so crazy but to be honest my intuition and premonitions usually are rigth and that's why I keep myself away from their music. Now I feel whoever that controlls her allows her little breaks in between her albums, they give us one innocent-looking and then bam, other more direct and the cycle repeats so people won't get too spoiled with the conspirancy theories. \n\nRecently I came to a theory online which claims Taylor Swift is actually a clon of a Satanists Zeena LaVey created to keep her work under a different \"alias\". Google  \"Taylor Swift Satan\" and search for images. The resemblance is stunning. Like omg they seem the same person. Idk lol. This sounds crazy but after all of that it wouldn't be surprising if it ends up being true.\n\nAlso both Elon Musk and Mark Zuckemberg give me really bad vibes, despite I don't think of Elon as being posessed but he surely is a starseed from the bad species and secretly he plans to take over humanity despite he seems as if he would be some kind of saviour. Mark Zuckerberg feels more like a clon or a robot, evil too lol.\n\nAbout Miley Cyrus, Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and Lana del Rey I think they are no evil inside but are under the influence of some strong evil force despite in the inside they are still noble human beings and they are kinda figthing against their demons. But they misslead young teens.\n\nTo be honest I think the whole hollywood and celeb industry is a very dark place and almost everyone there has to some degree dark undertones. I would save very little of them such Keanu Reeves, Ben Barnes or Liam Neeson, but about them we cannot even be sure. \nWho else do you think has that dark aura? \n\nLol sorry if my declarations sound wild but at least is what I pick up when I see these people \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude48",

The guy is kinda shy but still. This past weeks I know he has been feeling down/sad, so I asked him if I could help him, I tried to show him my shoulder but he didn't open up. So yesterday night I send him a message telling him even if I didn't understand was going on in his mind he had my support (seriously because the poor guy was abot to cry), he told me \"Thank you so much for caring\" and sent me 2 red heart emojis. He sent me that yesterday almost at 12 midnight (This is not the first time he sends me red heart emojis after I send him something). And today he almost didn't even greet me!!!! Can you believe it? Today he hasn't meet my eyes, he is working in other section but still, he didn't reply a message I wrote him after I answered a message he sent me and I was an hour late. Now he entered in the room like two minutes ago to ask another doctor something and it was like I didn't even was there, I was a ghost, on the days he's \"good\" he would have told me \"Hi, (insert a compliment). And I know tomorrow he might be also super cold too but maybe on Friday he will start talking again and try to be a good \"Friend\" I really don't know what is going on. This is the same guy that I commented before. If you check out my profile you'll find the whole story. One day he shows me he's interested in me, and the other he will ignore me. What the hell is going on, he's driving me nuts! Thank you so much for your support. \n\nAditional information: He seems to be an ISTJ (Myers briggs personality type) if that helps to understand it better. He's Capricorn for those who believe in astral signs. I'm an INFJ and I'm taurus. \n\nTL;DR : Why a guy would engage in deep conversations with you one day and the other would almost ignore you exist? I have this guy that is hot and cold, one day he treats me like a queen, the other like if I was a ghost, why?"

                "body": "I'm a 25 year old woman, I met a guy recently (two months), he's my coworker, we're both young adults (he's also 25). We have become friends due to the time we spend together and suddenly he has started doing some things that let me wondering what he actually wants/feels. I don't know if he has a gf because I've not been able to ask him, I'm super shy about it and ask it would feel like I'm really interested in him.\n\nThe first day we met he asked me for my phone number with the excuse of letting me know if a patient needed me (we work together in a medical center). It seemed strange to me because generally no one would ask me for my phone number in the first two minutes after I just have met someone, but out of cortesy I gave it to him (he's also the son of the boss of the medical center). Later we got to know each other more and at first he looked at me a lot, tried to hide it but I could feel it anyway.\n\nThen a week after, out of nowhere he started treating me super dry, he did not reply to my messages quickly or he left me in blue double check (in whatsapp- sorry for the term I'm not a native English speaker), almost as if he did not care, I decided then to continue treating him the same... just as a coworker.\n\nThen about 2 weeks passed and out of nowhere he started to speak to me more and started complimenting me every time he saw me, he said those things as if he was joking. For example I would say \"Tell me doc, did you talk to me?\" (When I didn't listen to him well) and he would tell me \"Yes, I said that I'm deeply in love with you\" and he laughed and I also took it as a joke.\n\nBut he also tells me things like \"You lighten up my day\" when I enter the room in the morning or \"the most beautiful person in the unit arrived\" or \"that uniform looks beautiful on you\" (He has always told me about the uniforms, every every time I do something new, put on different clothes or do my hair differently, he never misses the opportunity to let me know that he likes it) or \"I'm going to dream about you all night\" or \"happy the man who owns you\" or \"they say soulmates do the same. \"\n\nThe problem is that he is talkative and joker by nature and he uses it as an excuse for his shyness because he is when expressing feelings (not like B, another colleague who told me up front that he likes me but I don't like him hahaha so we continue as friends), but I have noticed that A with the rest of the coworkers makes jokes and is talkative but not in that sense or to the point of saying \"I'm in love with you\" or things like that.\n\nHe also seeks to make \"accidental\" physical contact with me for absolutely no reason but then wehn we cassualy talk about relationships he tries to connect me with B. He asks me if I like B and I have already told him many times that I don't like B.\n\nThen cassualy the other day he asked me what kind of men I liked and I told him that I liked them exactly the way he is. He was surprised cause he \"thought\" I liked B, once again I told him I don't like B.\n\nHowever, I don't know how he actually feels and I hate feeling that way because now I also feel things for him. We agree on many things, our tastes are similar, it is like a soul related to mine. One day, speaking seriously, he told me \"I don't open up easily to a woman, it's hard for me to express my emotions, to do so I have to love her very much\"\n\nAnd I followed the conversation. Then yesterday he began to tell me personal things, what he thinks about life, his beliefs and that he considers me a very good person, he has told me many times that I am very sweet . We had one of those deep conversations, the kind that you only have with friends you've known for a long time and that you would never have with someone you've barely known for 2 months and we've barely really met.\n\nYesterday I had also been a bit sad about a situation and I told him how a patient had treated me very bad and that I was about to cry, he offered me his support and then he said \"I don't care if all the nursers here start crying in line, but I care about you, no one should make you cry ever, you don't deserve it, please don't cry\". After that, hours later we were working and I was already normal and happy when out of nowhere, without having asked him, he began to massage my shoulders and neck, which lasted more than 15 seconds. When he let me go I couldn't help but continue playing him too and I started to massage him, only mine lasted less time, about 7 seconds because I'm also very shy in that sense.\n\nThe other thing is that he sent him a message about 1 week ago congratulating him on the doctor's day (he wasn't in the health care center that day) and back he wrote me \"how cute you thought of me\", and he sent me 2 hearts. We keep talking very cool with memes all over and until yesterday that I wrote to him we were talking well, but out of nowhere the last message I sent him did not open it and I know he has been online. Honestly, I would love to be able to start a relationship with him (I even feel like I'm falling in love) he's not clear about his intentions. One day it seems that he adores me and the next that he doesn't care about me and that everything is just a game.\n\nIt is also strange to me the fact he hasn't a gf or at least I don't know her and nobody does. People in our circle has told me he's been very shy about relationships and he spends too much time studying so his social life is almost none. And I guess the same happens to me because in the past two years I haven't dated anyone due I'm super busy.\n\nDo you thing he feels things for me or he is only seeing me as a friend and it all is only in my mind because I think I'm also a bit in love with him? What should I do? Help, please.\n\nTL;DR : I met a guy recently and I have no clue if he may feel something else for me or I am just imagining things. I have no clue what I should do next without making weird our daily life because we work side by side and see each other almost everyday."

Especially Medea since she's already a cold and stoic person to begin with, but Psyche has showed too many blushes and panics whenever she's having a sweet moment with Medea. I bet if only same-sex romance were a little more normalized in Korea, the author would've gone Yuri all the way since the earlier chapters."

I've read several manhwas with that trope before but i forgot the names. I really like this kind of trope because of personal reasons.

But I have the bad habit of looking up celeb charts every time they come across my timeline so that I understand what type of footprints they leave in the world and why. In a sense, I feel like everyone has a purpose. And no matter how we feel about it, if they\u2019re meant to do something, nothing and no one can get in the way of that. \n\nAll of the girls have their Neptune in public houses (either 1st or 10th house). All 5 of them. This is such a rare occurrence to see in the chart of any family, let alone one as big as this. \n\nKim and Kylie have their Neptune\u2019s in their 1st house (which is no wonder these two became the most popular overtime). Not only do they have the sex symbol aspect (shared by the late Marilyn Monroe) but they also have the ability to identify with their Neptunian personas at all times rather than just when dealing with the public or at work (more common in 10th house Neptune). It would also explain why Kris favored these two, as Neptune in the first can often be affiliated with Golden Child syndrome. \n\nKhloe, Kendall, and Kourtney have Neptune in their 10th house. Which explains why all 3 girls are more comfortable modeling and taking pictures than being on camera and making their life revolve around the family business. It\u2019s clear that these 3 would prefer to do their own thing more often than not.\n\nAnother interesting observation is that all 5 girls have planets and points sitting in the 8th house. Which could explain why all of the girls were able to acquire wealth in this life time. \n\nNo matter how they\u2019re viewed in the 3D, they did something right in the 5D to end up with these chart signatures. \n\nWhat\u2019s most interesting is that Kris Jenner\u2019s moon is in 10th house and her Neptune in second house is Conjunct her first house Mercury. It makes sense that she\u2019d be most comfortable in the role of a momager. As well as the fact that she makes a living off of selling a dream to others on a regular basis. \n\nLastly, the sex symbol thing. For the girls who took the sex symbol route.. Lilith is prominent in their charts. Kylie has Lilith Conjunct Venus in 8th house, Kim has Lilith Conjunct sun in 11th house, Khloe has Lilith in 1st house (which would explain why she had the hardest time feeling like the \u201cugly duckling\u201d and felt the need to get a lot of work done as a result). It\u2019s crazy when you see how much these ladies were just being true to their chart signatures all along. And all along, they were hated for doing just that. \n\nIf anyone has witnessed anything in their charts regarding past life karma, I\u2019d be curious to hear your take on this matter. These ladies are more interesting than they appear. I have a strong feeling their ancestors created a lot of good karma for their bloodline and paved the way for them"

The paint is chipping off the building and there\u2019s debris all over the ground. The strangest part is that all of the windows are frosted. Even once the front doors opened, there was another door leading to the front desk, and those windows were frosted too.\n\nI don\u2019t know why, but I felt so much agony while walking by the building.

It was in an incredibly secluded area and you couldn\u2019t tell if anyone was in the building.\n\nI\u2019m trying to make sense of the energy I picked up on.

No mystical idealism to hide behind and make myself seem different or more interesting.\n\nIt feels like an ego death on steroids. And the only thing I care about at this time is love.

Only the rogue survived, was knocked out by the trap on the chest and luckily Ezmerelda was still there to be attacked by the claws, otherwise it'd have been over. The players hit lvl9.\n\nAnyway. One players character had already died before when fighting the Hags in the Old Bonegrinder. Their soul basically belonged to Barovia now, since it was Daddy Strahd that resurrected them. When the now lvl9 Phantom Rogue wanted to use their totems, only one of the two responded. The one that responded was resurrected by the Abbot. Almost in exchange of her ears or nose.\n\nThe other one, decided to take me up on my offer to become Victor Vallakovich. They originally asked to be a Vistani and that just seemed like it'd invite too much trouble.\n\nNow my boy Victor is a bit of a difficult one. Troubled past, poor judgement, odd decisions. I'll allow Exethanter to find him and at least keep him warm for a bit. But he's going to have to have a way out. Which of course, also means he gets a way back in. Since I'll allow the PC to obtain enough knowledge to recast the Teleportation Circle with the runes for the Amber Temple.\n\nI don't really want Victor to have much info about the Temple from the inside though. Realistically speaking, there wouldn't be food for him so he couldn't have explored a lot anyway without having to leave, and without healing he was not in the best state to notice much of his surroundings. Now the big question is: Where should I put the other end of the circle? Would there be one in Krezk? That's where the rest of the party is currently. Or do you have a more fun option?"

Her ideas are more utilitarian ie. how to be stronger, but not as an existential need. I don't feel like the Abott would take pity on her the same way he did on the Belviews. Additionally, the Abbot does not appear to have a general scientific curiosity that would make him just turn people into things.\n\nBut also, I sort of want to do it because it seems like it could either kill her character in about 90+% of cases (which she'd be fine with), but also because it'd be weird and fun and quirky.\n\nHer idea is to somehow be able to inject holy water with her bite, which to me is too specific and seems too much cyber punk body modification.

They did not discover that she's on Strahd's side and decided to go with her diverting the town guard and deal with Izek. They found Ireena and proceeded to capture Vargas and his wive. We ended the session when they entered Victors attic room (after getting zapped by lightning).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal idea for what happens next would be: Cultists show up to burn the Burgomasters Mansion. While the players deal with Victor, the building catches on fire. This of course raises the drama. Lady Wachter wouldn't mind the burgomaster and the party burning.\n\nFor the next day, the festival of the blazing sun was going to happen. This would be another opportunity for Lady Wachter to show her more evil tendencies by burning the Vallakovich family alive as part of the festival in a way, perverting the burgomasters original intentions as petty revenge. What I don't know yet is what else is going to happen after all of this goes down. How exactly does Lady Wachter seize power? She could easily hold an election since she has enough cultists and more people likely wary to afraid of her that'd not oppose her anyway. I'm not really sure how to proceed. My personal plan is to have the party leave Vallaki with Ireena to eventually move towards Krezk, but give them the option to deal with Lady Wachter. Victor could still shed some light on the situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow have you dealt with Vallaki in your games?"

The hook will likely start with the party getting tagged along with a mutual friend to perform some silly ritual at the cities largest graveyard on Halloween as a joke. They end up releasing some evil spirit along with ones that could be the reason why they end up getting their classes (eg. Ancient Warrior spirit bonds with the dude who wants to be a fighter). This gives them their first encounter against some skeletons and what not. Some of the party might also just be people that are part of the magic community if the city that just so happen to be nearby or were ordered to by some organization, to make it easier to tie people into the overall story and give them some direction.\n\nSince I'm still figuring out how to approach it as a whole, I was wondering if any of you had some knowledge to share on what to avoid (eg., is it better to replace references to real living people because possibly fighting them creates weird moments). How much lizard folk can I use to explain weird politicians?"

Does anyone else feel this way? \n\nThe thing you should've taken away from this experience is that you are simply feeding an addiction. You wanted the thrill of getting the big prize and once you got it, it actually didn't give you satisfaction or make you enjoy the game more. So you actually don't want the thing you want, you want the feeling of getting it. And that is not healthy.\n\nWould it be cool if the game was F2P friendlier and would give you the thrill you seek more often? yes! but they rely on the kick you get from pulling a rare character to be so tempting that you get impatient and spend money on it. This is why those games are dangerous.\n\nI'm not saying genshin is bad. it's actually absolutely insane that you can play such a game for free.... and you can play it for free and experience every facet of the game - besides pulling rare things out of countless random lootboxes. So - funnily enough - if you like the part that gives these types of games their name - then this game is nothing more than a hazard to your financial and mental health. If you play the game for the gameplay, the visual design, the story, the worldbuilding etc and can resist the allure of shiny 5 star characters that are not necessary at all then this game is beyond what you could hope for.\n\nMy tip: instead of asking water to not be wet, just go with the flow: you will get cool and rare stuff, but it will come at it's own pace. If you want something specific and want it right now, it will cost you an exorbitant fortune because you have to bribe lady luck and she can be birch (notoriously cranky tree). This is what those games are designed to do - use impatience and fear of missing out to pressure you into a bad decision (spending money on a slot-machine is never a wise investment). But if you are satisfied to embrace the randomness and accept not getting everything immediately, then you'll end up with pretty great stuff too without having spent anything. \n\nWhat the game actually is lacking is stuff to do with your characters... so if you get more characters, you are making the equation even more lopsided (maybe just in my weird logic). And if you're really just into pulling rare stuff out of randomly assorted packs, then you need to invest in a (physical) trading card game or something like that where the things you pull actually have value and can be traded etc. or just get into the stock market... it probably scratches the same itch...\n\nI'm sorry if i'm just bashing onto you with what i think you have to do and how you have to enjoy this game or live your life etc. i just want to make sure people don't fall for the tricks of those companies because underneath that, you have a pretty excellent game that deserves to be played... so play the game instead of getting played by it.",

I quickly guessed that they're (unofficial) translations and that it's logical that the names/wording is different, but the meaning is also different. Finally skills started making sense, combos that somehow didn't work revealed themselves as uncompatible and the brand/target/mark brainplosion started making sense...\n\n\nAm i the only one that has that feeling? am i playing a different version? is it all in my head?"

At a quantum level particles show both wave and particle properties. So it's not that quantum level is unorganized. It's just things that are not observable in the macroscopic world become observable.\n\nInstead of E=mc^2, energy of a photon is given by E=pc (p is momentum). Energy is purely from it's momentum. Thus it can't be at rest.\n\nThe wall they hit obviously consists of atoms. Photons hit these atoms as waves, not as particles. The process of reflection doesn't happen like a ball hitting a wall.

So the next time machine is fed data it will use this line to relate and classify new data. Since it's more like an average it will never match the dots so it has \"bias\" towards the middle line.

Just last year she had asked me if I was comfortable with my body, but I thought it wasn't really a deep question since we had had an argument about shaving  and just told her that I was. She asked me the same today, but I told her I didn't know and then I opened up a bit more, admitting that I was and they told me that if I was sure I could go to a psychologist in the nearest city to fully confirm it so that I could transition. For now, I'll just wait and see what we do.\nI have very mixed feelings about it, since I expected it to go way worse and not to be so soon, but they're fully accepting and just want to make sure I 100% know I want this. I have yet to choose a name or discuss that with them too, but I'm also kind of glad I'm over with this :)"

Communist collectivist beliefs lead to holodomor, the \u2018cultural revolution\u2019 in china, and in the USSR\u2019s case in WW2; leveraging the populace/unarmed military as human shields, in Stalingrad particularly, was considered a totally sound concept \u2014 not morally, but they won still at a 5:1 casualty rate \n\n2) The USSR\u2019s employment of espionage in WW2 was debatably unparalleled in capability. Sure, the enigma, midway, but Stalin knew about the US\u2019s nuclear efforts at every step, their highest ranking spy \u2014 the US Dept. of Commerce\u2019s deputy head \u2014 lead the Japanese to choose their pacific strategy via oil & iron embargoes bringing the US into the war as the USSR\u2019s borders were in collapse, and more importantly keeping them from joining Operation Barbarossa where they would have invaded the USSR from the east via Manchuria & assuredly leading to an Axis victory over the USSR. \n\n3.) the Soviets under General Zhukov, who I\u2019d say along with US Gen Patton & Nazi Gen. Rommel was one of the best generals in the war, reversed the Nazi offensive for good after the Battle of Kursk. The Nazis had one, remaining solid gambit, and upon launching the battle found the Soviets had planned for weeks booby trapping the entire region, annihilating the Luftwaffe\u2019s forward air units immediately prior (with their espionage deserving the credit for their preparation), and winning the largest tank battle of all time defeating the best units of the Wehrmacht, where without proper preparation likely would\u2019ve been a nazi victory. \n\nIf we count the fall of france & other early allied losses, I\u2019d argue the soviets were on par. Yes they used troops like cannon fodder, but they won in the eastern theater, beat the allies to berlin, and overall defeated the largest, most experienced bulwark of the Wehrmacht. The allies in Europe did not face any nazi force of comparison until the battle of the bulge which was still meager in comparison to the eastern front.",

Couple that, with having mountain air bases which can host more than 500 fighters, and countless other military-applied geographic qualities \u2014 crossing the strait, even after bludgeoning Taiwan with ballistic missiles, would be shooting fish in a barrel. China\u2019s potential strategies are aware of this. An example invasion scenario would involve the deployment of a massive covert force, coupled with cyberwarfare information blackout, electronic combat systems, various other factors, and rapid deployment to attempt to simply blockade Taiwan and yield an inkling of opportunity to attempt a grueling crossing. China could *eventually* overwhelm & exhaust Taiwan\u2019s singular capabilities, but at the loss of mind boggling numbers. They would be immediately annihilated with foreign support, and boast nuclear deterrence in hopes that could prevent it. Yet, even in the event of successful deterrence, Taiwan being equipped thoroughly prior could still verily inflict such catastrophic damage fundamentally crippling the force needed to even seize a beachhead. \n\nTaiwan has systems designed to strike deep into China, they\u2019re far from limited to solely an absolute defense posture. \n\nChina\u2019s strategy will ultimately involve a complex grand maneuver, that\u2019s partially covert, rapid, and involving multi-domain assaults to establish control over a *pathway* for further invasion all within hours to make any further measures remotely tractable.

(2) more clearly recognized *practical* practices such as the notorious Pulsa diNura, ceremonial practices, and others a bit too obvious for discussion. Oddly, paradoxically though, Rabbinic authorities called for punishment via Pulsa diNura of publishers of the Zohar in the 16th century. \n\n**Conclusion/Questions**: \n\n* Is there any actual distinction between *meditative* and *practical* kabbalah? If so, what broadly defines the borders? What would differentiate a non-practical meditative technique from a practical meditative technique? \n\n* To me, it seems implied Aryeh Kaplan referenced some of these otherwise forbidden *practical* books (as they\u2019re cited, unless he reviewed the source indirectly, perhaps with a limited excerpt of the source versus the source cited in its totality). Given this, is reviewing a *practical* work for *theoretical* purposes/edification/learning (versus, utilizing the practices described) sanctioned? From my understanding & practice, I don\u2019t even dare open such works out of concern regarding how the contents may affect me from even viewing, not even reading, the materials (e.g., potentially seeing a sigil within a work like Shorshei HaShemot, which I have wrapped in archival paper & bubble wrapped to mitigate someone from even accidentally opening it, I only presume to own it due to the cover title \u2014 if the contents were not what the cover says, I would not know).  \n\n* Before anyone says \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter you shouldn\u2019t be concerned with this\u201d, I have no ambition of delving into frankly any/either practice, although my question still looms. Honestly even if it was considered completely fine to peruse the contents of something like Shorshei HaShemot for theoretical/academic/knowledge-expanding purposes, I\u2019ve seen far too many cautions of mortal consequences to even entertain the idea."

If Roald Dahl showed himself willing to change his own work to be less offensive, it goes to say that if he were somehow still alive today, he might be open to changing his work once more. It's a pretty reasonable conclusion to make.\n\n\nBy the way nobody is censoring Roald Dahl, it's just a new edition. Nobody is burning books and nobody is being silenced. If it was translated into another language, and the translator omitted the offensive language you would never even know. \n\nI saw other people suggest annotations, which I think is an excellent idea for literature aimed at older people. In a short story for children, an abridged version, updated as a modern text makes much more sense. We have been abridging and updating works since the beginning of time, it really is not a big deal, we're not losing anything but a few slurs lol",

They did it with loads of Enid Blyton books, off the top of my head. IDK, Didn't Spielberg and Lucas go back and change scenes in ET and/or Star Wars? Artists even change lyrics to match the times. And in the end, nobody really cared that it was changed. \n\nSay what you want, some of those texts were horrid and we all know language is powerful. You can keep them in, but do you know what happens eventually? People stop choosing those books. Because there are other books in existence that don't use slurs or offensive language that they have to explain to the five year children why not to use in order to prevent offending someone. \n\nFinally, the Dahl people don't care about secondhand editions and books in libraries. There's no profit in those books. It's about enticing NEW buyers and there are definitely people who will buy a new version of Roald Dahl knowing it uses less controversial language. So basically, in the interest of money, this was the smartest thing to do.",

At best your husband has a kink, and he's taking this opportunity to live out his fantasy. \n\nLet me start with this, he ain't meet no damn spiritual 68 yo woman on a bitcoin forum, girl does that make sense?  What spiritual 68 yo is even on forums like that? They don't even make it off Facebook! \n\nHe definitely told his boss that this 68 yo is his MOTHER and he needs to go care for her due to ill health (call them and ask because I know as a carer that is the only reason work would let him take three weeks off). He told you she's some random 68 yo lady to corroborate.\n\nNow why the f\\*\\*k would he need to see her vagina?  At first I thought, maybe this lady secretly IS his mother until he said might have to look at her vajayjay. As I've said I've been a carer for a disabled person, there is basically ZERO reason he needs to be seeing her vagina as a non professional.\n\nSo anyway, he's either having an affair, I doubt the lady is 68 but stranger things have happened or he's got himself into trouble and he's being blackmailed/coerced. Sounds farfetched, but not nearly, and let me emphasise this, **not nearly** as farfetched as a grown married man suddenly becoming so altruistic he's decided to abandon his whole life and job to go selflessly care for 68 yo woman he barely knows (but only for three weeks ???) by fixing her spotify and zoom. Please, when has that ever happened. How many times in life has anyone (least of all a man LOL jk) ever been that selfless?\n\nI'm really not coming for you, I can understand why you want to believe him, but you should really start protecting yourself and your kids. Even in the slim possibility that all of this is true, he's just abandoning you for three weeks with little to no regard and that's terrible behaviour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had a lot more to say, but I recognise it's not really fair of me or anybody to be playing detective when you must genuinely be hurting.

Here comes a long one but I'm going a little nuts atm:\n\n\n31F/ 5'11 SW: 230.6 CW: 225 GW: happy\n\nTL;DR I fear my metabolism is completely screwed due to thyroid medication I took for two years as a significant change in diet and lifestyle has made no difference to weight.\n\n\n\nI started my journey in earnest back in February, but I reached my HW of 236 last Oct.\n\nBack in 2019, I was diagnosed with Graves and Hyperthyroidism after being hospitalised with Thyrotoxicosis during a really stressful time in my life. I gained lost and regained the same 50lbs in less than 18 months (it was closer to a year, but I'm being generous about the initial gain)- and apart from one month of lazy keto, I did not change my diet or exercise. It was really crazy, I was like elastigirl. People thought I was abusing something.\n\nIt finally stabilised at the top end but my metabolism has not been the same since. I just came off the medication in January which was what prompted me to give weightloss another go. Please - if you're one of those people here to say \"meds can't cause weight gain/loss they only make you hungry\" or anything similar, I'm just going to ask you to stop and leave. I can only speak anecdotally, but because of the thyroids I pay close attention to things like weight and diet even when I'm not dieting because those are the first signs. \n\nThis time last year I weighed 224-230lbs, it was the first lockdown in the UK, I was super depressed, completely sedentary, ordering takeaway every other day, a newfound addiction to Coca-Cola (shortlived thank god) and sleeping maybe 4 hours a day. I wasn't surprised at all by my weight.\n\nToday I weigh 225, I average 8k steps, I alternate pilates and strength training in the evening (beginners) and cardio every morning. I cut out all soda, caffeine, quit smoking, upped my h2O game and I've dramatically reduced my added salt intake as that's a trigger. It was a lot at once but it was  worth it. I aim for 1400-1600 cals, which I usually hit. I just had a bad week, but I've been genuinely been consistent and I count everything I possibly can. MFP is useless for Caribbean food but I weigh everything I can and do my best. I hate counting and don't intend to do it forever but I understand it.\n\nI lost 4lbs of water weight in one week back in Feb and I've bounced around 1-2lbs these last 2 months. It's VERY disheartening. In February, I set what I thought was a very realistic goal to lose ~30lbs by Aug. That would take me to onederland and be my sort of halfway point. That *was* about 5lbs a month. But now it's nearly May, and losing 30lbs by Aug has become unrealistic because what I'm doing clearly isn't working.\n\nNow - I do feel better in some ways. I feel a bit stronger. I was a hermit, almost agoraphobic, at the beginning of the year and now I get out just about everyday. I sleep a bit better (6 hours opposed to 4- working on it). I get less headaches because I'm super hydrated. I redecorated my room so I actually have space to work out. I'm enjoying working out. I *think* I've lost about an inch around my waist. But the weight is not moving.\n\nI only added strength training two weeks ago so I don't think that accounts for the previous two months of nothing. My strength training is only 20 mins with a 12kg kettlebell lol. I'm use light 3kg dumbbells in my cardio. So I doubt I've put on any muscle. I did a 24 hour fast last week and I saw a little dip, but that went back up to 224 within a couple days. I don't know how all of this could be water retention but I do have a love of salty foods.\n\nThis is the most patient and consistent I've been with weight loss. I'm in this for the long haul. But I think it's fair to say that after three months and basically no results something is  wrong, right? \n\nSomeone is going to say calorie counting and I'm begging you to believe me when I say there is no way I'm am eating at maintenence (224, 31F 5'11 TDEE gives me a default 2392. Even at BF of 40% it would be 2k. I know my muscle mass is very low, but my TDEE would have to be somewhere around 1600 for me to be maintaining the same weight for months, not including any exercise. And that seems very inaccurate for a woman my size, surely.\n\nI hope someone here can see something I can't and help me out where I'm going wrong. For years I gave up on ever getting in shape because of my health problems and now it feels like I was right. Advice appreciated."

                "body": "Hi guys. I'm here to talk to you about my addiction to salt. This is called, Dr Saltlove (or how I learned that I'm addicted to sodium and need to quit). Maybe this is all obvious to you but I'm newly learning that it's a major problem for me, so I want to cut it.\n\nThis is going to be so hard, salt is delicious. Second only to MSG in how awfully delicious it makes everything, but msg is less readily available. All our family meals are heavily spiced and seasoned, and whilst we use way more interesting things than salt, it is still a main ingredient. However a diet like that inevitably comes with a risk of high blood pressure and I am personally prone to kidney problems. I also have graves and hyperthyroidism which complicates everything. \n\nMy decision to cut it is due to my binge yesterday. It's my time of the month, I was highly stressed about a few things and I thought about it for the whole day before I decided to order Nandos. I was in a good calorie deficit for the day so it wouldn't have been so bad if I had stuck to my plan of ordering enough for one, but I ordered enough for two. Then I thought, I'll save half for later. \ud83d\ude06. Anyway I ate the whole thing. I couldn't stop eating the chips because of that peri salt. The hummus, nando sauce, the side of olives all so salty and delicious I just kept going.\n\nI thought my problem was carbs but the more I think about it, it's salt and savoury foods. I've realised when my food isn't salty, I eat way less because it isn't as satisfying. In fact I'd rather not eat at all than eat something unsalted. So to me, it's an addiction, like sugar, caffeine and nicotine all three I have quit to varying levels of success this year. I also barely drink alcohol anymore. These were things I thought I couldn't do and I did it.\n\nOne of my biggest cravings is crisps. Lovely salty potatoes. Mmmmmmmm. When I was younger I would literally just eat salt. Just dip my finger in it. I used to sneakily eat bullion/stock cubes (maggi cubes omg). A dash of salt/all purpose seasoning on my tomatoes, avocados, cucumbers. Salty sardines and crackers. Marmite. Cheese. Salted butter. Jerky. I add salt and pepper to absolutely everything, even plain sandwiches. I don't like condiments at all (except on a burger/hot dog) apart from vinegar (because it goes well with salt) and soy sauce (because it is basically liquid salt). My favourite alcoholic drink is margaritas because of the salted rim (okay and the tequila). Before it became a thing, I thought I hated popcorn because it was always sweet in the UK. I went to Australia years ago and their default popcorn is salted. It was a revelation. I can't eat vegetables, rice or pasta without salt. You get the idea.\n\nI'm interested to see the affect it will have on my body. We often talk about water weight this and sodium intake that on here but it's so generalised. I calorie count, I drink 2-3 litres of water, more when I workout, but I don't take my sodium intake seriously. My weight this morning was 227.8 up from 225. I expected it. To be honest the scales have been on a f*ckery - I've only lost 5lbs in 3 months so whatever. But it made me think, seeing as salt really is such a big part of my life, I wonder how bad my water retention really is.\n\nIf you read all of that, my farewell to salt, I don't know why but thanks anyway. I know I'll never be able to completely avoid it so your tips and suggestions are welcome. Don't worry, I'm a very good cook, my food won't be lacking in flavour as I have a beasty of a spice cupboard, but I sure am gonna miss those little white flakes. It's just time to stop being such a salty ho."

Price action indicates a breakout (sets a new high well above resistance and settles above the level momentarily), but then a wide ranging indecision bar or two followed by a steep flush back down in seconds. The confusion comes when it then meets indecision at the bottom of the large red bar, and then climbs back near or above the high, and then repeats. Its very odd behavior for my limited experience to identify. Traded well, a killing could be made. I've just come up short in my awareness and execution.\n\nIn June/July I tended to do best (in different market conditions) riding more stable uptrends with ascending support, buying the dips near support after price action indicated continuation. Right now, I'm not seeing these setups as often. That was a lot of solid uptrends with flag and wedge type patterns. I'd occasionally snatch a bit off a double bottom here and there. What I'm encountering now is new to me, and no surprise I traded it badly, when I should have avoided trading altogether a condition I didn't fully understand.\n\nQuestion: When it comes to stops when scalping, do you recommend setting it just a bit below perceived support? (in a bullish trade). So if it breaks back beneath support, you get out because the move was invalidated? Thats usually how I handle it, but a few rapid flushes on failed breakouts got me flustered. I'm definitely cautious of breakouts right now.",

I know.\n\nIntroduction: I've been trading since March (a lot in a simulator, then small size, then scaling up gradually with success). I'm primarily scalping momentum on 1-15 minute time frames. July was a strong month with only a single red day and good steady profits, and looking back at my trade journal it seems I was best off trading bullish ranges (and only getting into the most obvious breakouts from there, often preventing losses on false breakouts by taking the profit early). Additionally, the 2nd hour of the morning seems to be my best time (likely due to more obvious setups emerging). I like to trade small cap between 2-20 and have had best results in that range, especially 10-20.\n\nHowever, this week has been terrible. I got burned by ABSI's early rally yesterday and subsequent crash (I failed to look up the news of the bad earnings report). Then I made the fatal error against my rules: I tried to average down and \"hope\" for a bounce, and instead I sized into a massive loss that put me well into net red. Ouch.\n\nToday I was strict in following my rules, but still a red day. I walked away before it got worse. I seemed to be trying to buy breakouts, and then they flush and I'm out. And then they climb back up. It seems so irrational right now, right when a stock seems enthusiastic, is the market prone to algo flushes right now? I think I need to avoid this type of trading with real money for now.\n\nI'm curious what you more experienced traders suggest I do. Back to simulated trading? Size down? Practice trading ranges and see if I get consistent again? I'm not a quitter, and I had too long of a steady winning run (two months of mostly green/78% win rate/steady profits/primarily ranges with occasional breakouts) to give up just because I made one really big mistake and got into a slump."

These environment variables can be anything, theoretically (please inform me if I've overestimated the scope and utility of envars).

Why couldn't I, say, have a personal default set of key bindings for common actions in similar video games?

The man's range is truly impressive and I think he'd be able to do really well as Hoid, particularly in an animated Stormlight adaptation.\n\nAlso, I've consumed The Cosmere almost exclusively as Graphic Audio, and I love Chris Davenport's portrayal, and Haberkorn is the only other person I can imagine delivering those lines in a satisfying way.\n\nI'm curious what others' picks for voice actors are. I've seen some screen actors lists, but not many VA lists. Don't be afraid to pick a screen actors if you think that their voice work is good enough, but remember that the pool for VA talent is very large.

My brother had a baby? I'm happy he's happy? (I actually use pictures of my mum and my other brother to gauge how healed I am. I used to not be able to see their faces and not spiral into a flashback for the whole day. Now I can, so I guess that's progress?)\n\nI feel so ridiculous. I feel like a lunatic. I\u2019m so comfortable in utter isolation but everybody probably has no idea why I'm doing this like I'm throwing a really long tantrum. I don't want to reconnect at all with my immediate family and I'm ok never seeing them again for the rest of my life. I don't want to be around them for even one second. Yet logically I know that's impossible.\n\nI don't even know how to explain myself to friends when they ask me why I disappeared for five years. That I have CPTSD and it's a reflex? I only discovered CPTSD two years ago, three years into my isolation. Imagine my relief and surprise that there's a whole bunch of us who use it as a coping mechanism."

Is that recommended? Any nice cities around Gwangju/Cheongju that\u2019s en route to Jeonju? \n\nAny thoughts or experience at all will be appreciated.

There are times when people (who are not narcissists) want attention and don\u2019t know how to get it, so they do something \u201cabnormal\u201d like sending a video of them crying or even an attempted suicide without the intention of dying. Because they feel as though the only way to get the attention they\u2019ve been trying to get for a while is through something big. These people need attention, but more importantly they need to learn how to get that attention in the \u201cnormal\u201d way: through talking to others etc, and they need professional support. I can understand why it would create the suspicion. I am not a therapist or a psychiatrist. But I want to say that a narcissist would engage in this behaviour repeatedly to the point where it\u2019s emotionally exhausting for those around them to keep up with their needs. Whereas someone who just wants help would say that they just want help and would probably not engage in the behaviour constantly. And if you see someone doing it constantly and you want to say something you can say \u201cthere are other ways to get attention\u201d rather than acting as though wanting attention is bad. At the end of the day if giving attention to someone becomes tiring for you, you should stop. Refer them to a professional.",

                "body": "I'm going to assume that you and Ben are typed correctly, which very well may not be true.\n\nI feel like Ben loved you throughout, for sure. I think it hurt him very much, yes. And I also think you not being able to tell any of that as it was happening is somewhat crazy to me. If I can tell all this from a single post, then I am honestly a bit confused as to how you couldn't tell. \n\nNonetheless, the past can't be changed. You're here now, in the present, and you have to make do with the cards you've been dealt.\n\nWhen an ISFJ starts thinking about a future with you and starts asking hypotheticals, that's a big deal. It is similar to you going against your personal values because of other people's arguments against your decision. The similarity is that, for someone you love and are investing in, you would be more inclined to make a decision based in their reasons over your personal values. It is the same feeling for him when he thinks of these what-if futures with you. \n\nWhen talking about personality types, there are cognitive functions. These are the most important thing. It's how people come up with the personality profiles in the first place. If you don't know what these are, google \"FiNe personality\" (which is the INFP), and you should be able to read up on your cognitive functions.\n\nFor ISFJs, their last function is extraverted intuition (Ne). Often, a lot of our big fears come from our last function. Ne has a lot to do with picturing what-if scenarios (along with other things, like figuring out how concepts relate to each other). As an INFP, you have this function second. For you, it's natural to use it. For Ben, it's extremely draining for him to use it. Often times, when we really want to invest in someone, we do so through our last function. For me, an ENFP, that means I am willing to do my girlfriend's homework before my own, or help her with routine, boring things. For an ISFJ like Ben, I'd imagine this means thinking of hypothetical futures with you, which is exactly what he did.\n\nMy point is, Ben invested a ton of resources into you. When you chose someone else, specifically his own brother, it deeply wounded him. It would be like a millionaire watching every dollar they had burn in front of them, one-by-one, as they were powerless to do anything to stop it. The investment the millionaire made, his/her time and money and attention, was all for nothing.\n\nBen also has extraverted feeling (Fe) second. This is very different from the introverted feeling (Fi) that you, as an INFP, have first. People with Fe high in their functions can often fall victim to not doing enough for themselves. They may also, like everyone at times, lie to keep harmony in a relationship. When you told him you were falling for his brother, I have no doubt he lied thru his teeth about what that made him feel to keep the harmony between you two.\n\nAnd he was right, because the times he did voice concern, you just discarded it by trying to tell him that it was okay. Obviously it was okay to you, but not to him, which is what he was trying to tell you.\n\nSo, of course, over time, the only way to stop this pain is to try to cut it out, which he did. First he tried to cut out the situation, because ExxPs and IxxJs often blame situations and circumstances for issues before we blame specific people. After he did that, he realized simply trying to live in ignorance wasn't going to work, he was still being deeply hurt. So what did he do? He realized the best way to stop the pain is to stop it at the source: you.\n\nNow I know (or hope) you didn't do this intentionally. INFPs are pretty notorious for feeling what they feel and expecting people to be able to get on board with that. Most people aren't like that, however. This is shown by the you telling someone who is supposed to be one of, if not THE, closest people on the world to you that it was \"not really his business,\" and the fact you just tried to get him to understand YOUR reasoning and YOUR perspectives. In all of this, I got a strong sense you were unbending to him. And yes, this is somewhat his fault for not voicing his problems well, but it's also your fault too for not compromising. \n\nYour values may be incredibly important to you, so much so that you feel anyone who doesn't agree with them is wrong, but you always have to be willing to compromise (as in give and take, not as in being a bad person) some of the extent of those values. Sometimes you have to do things you don't value in order to maintain the relationships that mean the most to you. This whole situation is a good lesson about that.\n\nHe is justified in most of his behaviors. Now I don't know exactly what he texted you, but I'm sure that, while the specific words were uncalled for, the overall message was likely justified. ISFJs are often very loving people, and it takes a lot for them to react the way he has with you. If he's as mature and great as you've been saying he is, then you already know this for yourself.\n\nWhat can you do? Honestly, not much. He sounds like he's trying to cut you out of his life, but sometimes misses you (hence the getting ahold of you recently). However, I unfortunately think this \"missing you\" will subside. I'm not an ISFJ, so I don't know the magic words to fix this situation or the best actions to take. I would, however, say that you need to take this as a lesson of sorts. If a situation is becoming complex, simplify it. You could have done this here by making it crystal clear what you and him were way back when. By either dating him or drawing hard boundaries so there would be no confusion. Instead, it very much sounds like you had your cake and wanted to eat it to. In other words, you wanted to be friends, but you also wanted him to treat you like he did, which is not how 100% plutonic friends interact.\n\nI'm sorry if this wasn't the response you were looking for. The thing is, the best I can do for you is give YOU advice on how to grow. I can't do anything with Ben, as nothing I say about \"he needs to do this or that\" will help anything. I hope someone who understands ISFJs a little better can help you with a specific way to mend this situation. However, in the meantime, use this as a growth opportunity and learning experience.\n\nI wish you the best of luck.",

I am starting to remember. \n\nTears form in my eyes as flashes of scenes and memories of the anime comes back to me.

Yet my brain knew what the song meant, something in that song connected to those deep buried feelings of sadness generated by watching Anohana.\n\nIt will never cease to amaze me at how our brains work and how music can be so intrinsically connected to memories of feeling.\n\nThe ending song of Anohana did not remind me of the memories of the anime, but rather the feelings I felt while listening to the ending song as I watched the anime.\n\nI think the memory-wipe must have been a trauma-control mechanism in the brain where excessively sad memories are just outright deleted to allow us to move on in life.\n\nYet the trauma control cannot erase the feelings associated with circumstantial memories of sound."

I have noticed that when using combat extended (which I have used for over a year) the difficulty ramps up really hard when you start getting mech raids, since the mechs have really high armor and if you haven't progressed your weapons tech and production by the first mech raid, you are basically screwed.\n\nOver the last week I have played a base which is largely normal (no special game rules or ideoligion) but with higher difficulty than I usually play: \"strive to survive\" with phoebe chillax (I like to focus on base building with the occasional major crisis, rather than constant crises). It went pretty well, the most dramatic events was when a warg killed my main builder (he was working at finishing the wall that were supposed to protect us from raids and wild animals ironically) and a largish tribal raid. Then some time passed and I had a mech assault with four lancers and a termite. \n\nI thought I was well prepared because I had AP builts for almost all rifles (the M60 still had FMJ) and an RPG-7 (5 heat and 1 thermobaric rocket) and an PTRS-41 (with FMJ ammo only).  All pawns had steel armor vest and steel helmet. I decided to take the fight to the enemy since there was a good position next to a beach where my pawns could take cover behind some rocks and because I knew the termite would anyway try to do its thing.\n\nI got destroyed. the PTRS-41 barely did any damage to the termite and the RPG-7 never hit the mark (best shooter was level 8, but was quickly replaced by level 3 or 4 pawn when he died) before running out of rockets (or out of people to fire them, I don't remember).\n\nNow, I learned a few lessons:   \n\\- Don't fight mechs in the open, stay behind your walls to maximize cover.   \n\\- AP ammo for classical weapons do next to nothing, even the Anti-Tank rifle.   \n\\- Lancer have long range so getting them into close quarter is crucial to dealing with them with RPGs (I plan to build a killbox or some other means to get them closer).\n\nMy question for the community is this: How do you survive the mech raid era with combat extended and higher levels of difficulty? How do you tech and produce weapons and armor fast enough? Do you build special killboxes to help destroying the mechs?\n\nThanks for any tips and tricks you have!"

I have never met someone who so fully understand me. We are both empaths (she diagnosed me) and while I am the more secluded version she is the more outgoing who always try to help and be there for everyone. This means that she often spends a lot of time and energy with others and try to make them feel good. However it means that she has very little time and energy left for me. I often find myself down prioritized and neglected. I think it is because she sees me as a safe place, someone to recharge her after she has recharged others. I feel like she is unconsciously using me, like many others use empaths for themselves. \n\nThis last couple of weeks she has been very busy and kept telling me that she doesn't have time to hang out, yet I know that she is hanging out with other friends because whenever she has problems and need support she calls me. I give it of course and many of those cases are when she hung out with other people during the week.\n\nBut then she is gone again and I feel like she doesn't return what I give when I need it from her, because she is too busy making others feel better... I feel like I am being abused by another empath so that she has enough energy to give others. The way she doesn't have time for me, but does for others make me feel very resentful towards her, even though I know it isn't malicious. I just feel taken for granted and I have no idea what to do. Can anyone related and give me some advice? I know I should talk to her but I don't know how to approach it, I don't want her to feel bad, I just want her to understand."

Turns out that was a big mistake\n\n[Pale pink 'Whispering Egg'.](https://preview.redd.it/hmvqo2x8ofc21.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d1c5d2a78d2d28402def5183d05c527af08d9c32)\n\nI was marked as dangerous so I approached it carefully, but nothing happenend. That is when I noticed the texture. \n\n'Huh, that looks just like the eggs in the Aliens movies. What a coincidence.'\n\nI try to 'E' it but nothing happens, I realize that I have to mine it to get to the sweet sweet resources.\n\nOnce it is finished mining, three of the monsters below pop up from the ground. I was half expecting a facehugger to come out of the egg, so a group of fully grown Xenomorphs took me completely by surprise! I panicked and ran for my close by spaceship (thank god). I didn't even use my jet pack because I was in a complete panic! Somehow I managed to get into my spaceship and take off. \n\nAfter having circled around the area and looking at the Xenomorphs, I realized two things. one, I left my portable refinery down there full with ferrite dust, and two, I never got a chance to screenshot the Aliens! (Is it weird that the first thing that popped into my head after nearly being killed, is that I never got a chance to take a photo of the killer?)\n\nSo I do the most stupid think I could do. I land on a nearby hill to take some photos. Bad. Idea. Just as I approach the side of the hill, one the Aliens crest the hill! Being wiser from the last experience, I spam the printscreen button while running backwards. After taking the pictures I jump up with the jet pack and run for the spaceship again. Again I managed to survive some how. After this I just hovered around until they left ('Spawning is subsiding' or something like that).\n\nTell me, have any of you encountered this before? Is this common?   \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tffkdmw8ofc21.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3c1a0533082500887a00f8983f83a08bfb7992cd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pd5j1tx8ofc21.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f070023ac083c37cb37ec52df876fffd5a7633e0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8regvnw8ofc21.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d36088fb3ba8dcba257db32966222c46850ef2ab\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sjbicww8ofc21.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1c1f02306fc525cb430caa0e19b02a90d1361f87"

The cruiser has 100 size-4 box launchers, where I will load 10 Decoys and 90 ASM (they have same range as the decoys but have a speed of 26600 km/s and have higher manoeuvre).  \n\nThe idea is to cause the enemy area defence vessels to expend their AAM missile on these harmless but tough decoys.\n\nI have calculated that I can saturate my own area defence vessel (a 5700 ton destroyer with 100 box launcher of S-1 AAM).\nThe characteristics of my AAMs for reference is this:\n\n    Buzzard\n    Missile Size: 1 MSP  (0.05 HS)     Warhead: 1    Armour: 0     Manoeuvre Rating: 20\n    Speed: 33000 km/s    Engine Endurance: 3 minutes   Range: 5.2m km\n    Cost Per Missile: 0.855\n    Chance to Hit: 1k km/s 660%   3k km/s 220%   5k km/s 132%   10k km/s 66%\n    Materials Required:    0.25x Tritanium   0.605x Gallicite   Fuel x25\n\nthe Buzzards chance to hit the decoy is approximately 34% (assuming chance to hit 20k km/s target = 33%)\nIf the buzzard successfully intercepts the decoy it has only a 33,3% chance of destroying it due to the decoys 2 armor (damage of AAM/(armor of ASM+damage of AAM)=1/(2+1)=1/3) using formula provided by Aurora Designer Steve http://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=1780.0 and assuming that one hit doesn't remove the armor and allow the missile to continue.\n\nCombining these probabilities gives 34% * 33.3%=11.3% (0.34*0.333=0.113)\n\nThis means that on average only 1 in 9 AAM will successfully destroy the decoy.\n\nAfter some intense spreadsheeting I was able to calculate that the Buzzard will have approximately 8 chances to intercept given the distance both missiles travel in one increment ((19200+33000)*5=261000) and the total range of the Buzzard (ask if you want more info/access on my google spreadsheet).\n\nThe above calculations tells us that 10 decoys should be able to expend 80-90 of my area defense Destroyer's Buzzards, thus reducing the number of AAMs to intercept the 90 actual ASMs to 10-20.\n\nGiven that my actual ASM have a speed of 26600 km/s the Buzzards only have about 26.4% chance of hitting them. This means that it would require a little less than 360 Buzzards to intercept the 90 ASMs (26.4% hit chance means only about 1 in 4 (3.8) buzzards will hit, thus 90*4=360)\n\nCombined I would need 5 destroyers (360+80=440 Buzzards required at least) in order to counter one cruiser's arsenal.\n\nPlease tell me what you think and what I have missed. This post might perhaps only highlight how bad my Buzzard AAMs are, in which case please provide me with a better AAM design at an equivalent tech level (Magneto-plasma Drive Tech, Engine power x3.50, Fuel Consumption 0.7, warhead strength 5 per MSP, 48 agility per MSP)\n\nIf one wants to further increase the required number of AAMs to fully defend against my cruisers, a ratio of 50/50 of decoys/ASMs can be used, this way 400-450 missiles would be expended on the decoys, and a further 200 missiles would be needed for the 50 ASMs, giving a total of 600-650 Buzzards required. That is about 6-7 worth of Destroyers. Although the damage potential is drastically reduced, but might be necessary for tough targets with lots of AAMs."

Emailbearbeitungszeit betr\u00e4gt laut denen mehrere Wochen, mein Stromvertrag m\u00fcsste aber zum 31.12. gek\u00fcndigt werden. Weitere Kontaktm\u00f6glichkeiten gibt es nicht.       \n\n     \nKann ich jetzt annehmen, dass f\u00fcr den Allg.stromtarif keine Erh\u00f6hung kommt, wenn mich kein Brief erreicht hat? Ich habe Angst, dass sie mir dann kommen mit \"wir haben einen Brief rausgeschickt, dass der nie ankam, da k\u00f6nnen wir nichts f\u00fcr!\" (Wo ich um ehrlich zu sein nicht verstehe, weshalb solche wichtigen Informationen nicht per Gesetz via Einschreiben versendet werden m\u00fcssen.

And he just says \"Sorry, needed to get that out.\" So it's a fucking *tic* now?

Turn off your phone, get away from social media, drink a smoothie.\n\n \n\nBecause yeah, Gus is fucking cool, so is representation. So is the parallels with Eda's curse and real life disabilities and mental health issues, as is King's whole deal and backstory. \n\n\n\nIt's a fucking great show, is my point. A lot around to like, and it's fine to like some things more than others as long as you don't go on a power trip online about how \"the fandom reduces Amity to crushing on Luz\" or how \"Luz doesn't like otters that much, stop drawing fan art of her with an otter staff\" Fanartist are not obliged to cater to anybody's head cannons/preferences/ships.

You are not the Lord of Men, and shall not be, though all Arda and Menel fall in your dominion. Beyond the Circles of the World you shall not pursue those who refuse you.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Beyond the Circles of the World I will not pursue them,\u2019 said Morgoth. \u2018For beyond the Circles of the World there is Nothing. But within them they shall not escape me, until they enter into Nothing.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThis quote seems to speak to the ultimate failure of darkness and the denouement of Eru\u2019s plans for Arda, with the thralldom of Morgoth to Eru\u2014Morgoth may believe he has ultimate power in Middle-earth, but beyond death he has no power upon anyone. H\u00farin\u2019s heart speaks to him, saying that beyond death there is more than \u201cnothing,\u201d which is how Morgoth evilly describes it.

I know consciously I should be detaching into bushes, but learning how and when to do it *in the moment* is, well, difficult. \n\nYou're talking about a Comfey who either doesn't yet know how to play or isn't going to learn. And they'll lose because of it, so hopefully be lower ranked over time or just stop using it. \n\nTo help your Comfey, occasionally going past bushes helps. If they're chasing you to attach, it might be worthwhile to circle a moment so they can catch up. You aren't invincible, but you are stronger, for sure. Paying attention to the flowers on their lei is helpful. \n\nI can't speak for the others, but I'm primarily looking to just keep as many pokemon as possible alive. I do want to help a teammate become OP. Those who don't play well are not going to become OP, even with help. So while a Comfey detaching and going elsewhere is not necessarily a sign you aren't doing well(sometimes the other lane just needs it a little more), if you're doing poorly enough to be judged by your Comfey, well, they'll leave. Lmao. So while their departure doesn't necessarily mean you are bad, their continued presence does mean that you are at least *not* bad.",

Like National Dex Anything Goes in PokemonShowdown. There's no go-to certain victory pokemon. Arceus is very common but that's more for his type versatility. I've watched a legend spammer lose to pre-evos, as an extreme example (spammer could've played better, but they definitely weren't inting).",

There are more of both categories. The (regular) states of matter, as you can tell by the name only focus on matter. In a very basic sense, \nsolid: atoms are close together, in fact so close they cant move (the force keeping them together is way stronger than the one pushing them away from each other).\n\nliquid: atoms are still close together, but they can move more freely (the forces working against each other are equal)\n\ngas: atoms are spread out, as the force pushing them away is stronger than the force holding them together.\n\nplasma: free electrons\n\nphotons are just force carriers.

If you really want to learn hs math, you need to believe that the solution presented is the only correct solution, even if your intuition tries to think of other ways(as an example : because it is more interesting). If you try to learn it so you can apply it, don't learn hs math. Your inclination is definitely not repetition and precision, but rather abstraction, problem solving, and subdivision. \n\nYou could focus on those skills and learn topics like marketing. I think that would be a fullfilling topic for you as you think of: \n\"What are the goals, which factors bring us forward or stop us, how can we combine those factors, are there already existing and proven ways you *could* measure it?\" \ninstead of: \n\"Which equations do i need to know, how can i use my calculator faster, how can I show this in the perfect mathematical equation?\"\n\nI only know german books, as I am german, but I could add you on discord and translate vital parts for you. The topics in the books are pretty applicable and also touch visualisation of data, as well as real world examples. When it comes to long lasting businesses and strategies, we germans are the best, you really see this in our educational material for such topics.\n\nPm me if there is a demand.",

That picture is my absolute favorite of hers and I couldn't find a higher quality version, but it is not very noticeable unless you take your time to look at it (which I can't do while playing anyways) so I don't mind at all. The material of the skin is super nice, feels good to the touch, and stays on really well. I got a great deal with an April 50% off promo and only paid $20 so it was well worth the price! Fast shipping, and they seem to always have some sort of deal going on. I would totally recommend Skinit if you are looking to buy a custom skin.",

Instead of the two heads on Kindred, the cover had a drawing of a woman's head facing forward with her eyes closed. The drawing looked almost like pencil, and from what I remember sort of looked like the outline was a dotted line. Her hair was swept up away from her face, either short or tied up. Here are some images that are kind of similar: [1](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fas1.ftcdn.net%2Fjpg%2F02%2F11%2F98%2F06%2F500_F_211980618_KVWsu3V6qNx6ozGaLraKEQJPKEGEBGLL.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fstock.adobe.com%2Fimages%2Fyoung-woman-face-fashion-sketch-black-and-white-linear-face-drawing-vector-illustration-poster-banner-logo%2F211980618&tbnid=R_RqQHxD3MGMNM&vet=10CNgBEDMoXmoXChMI0OD85NWi6QIVAAAAAB0AAAAAEAo..i&docid=uHLzJjygBE9yuM&w=404&h=500&q=woman%20face%20eyes%20closed%20drawing%20black%20and%20white&hl=en&ved=0CNgBEDMoXmoXChMI0OD85NWi6QIVAAAAAB0AAAAAEAo) [2](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://i.pinimg.com/236x/7a/e4/8e/7ae48ef28eda6c33f135985cb809e28c.jpg&imgrefurl=https://www.pinterest.com/storesshops/fornasetti-plates/&h=314&w=235&tbnid=-svrPC11P-ICYM&q=woman+eyes+closed&tbnh=260&tbnw=194&usg=AI4_-kTzfTulsr57bAPMCY862mUq2Xnrnw&vet=1&docid=1lYRoNq2F0ELAM) [3](https://paintingvalley.com/blank-face-sketch#blank-face-sketch-35.jpg) . The cover was monochrome, black and off-white/cream colored, but there might have been a tint of pink/red on the woman's lips. It was a hardback with a dust jacket, and the book was about 1 inch thick or so. I believe it was published somewhere between 1970 and 1990, possibly later but not after 2000. I think the author was male, and the title started with \"The\", and was no longer than two or three words. Possibly just one word. I might be wrong with it starting with \"The\", but I'm fairly certain it did. Words that come up in my mind when I try to think of the title are immortal, mirror, chosen, seer (might be completely off but that's what I remember).\n\nI got this book at a used bookstore for free. I think it was a pretty obscure book, because I have spent years trying to find it online to no avail. I have gone through Wikipedia's lists of sci-fi books published between 1960 all the way through 2000 and have not found a match, as well as try to find the cover through searching by image with similar covers (such as Kindred). I don't remember much of the plot, but I do remember that it started with a scene in a location similar to a retirement home or hospital where an old woman in a wheelchair makes her way outside of the facility, I think to a garden or beach? Might have been an elevator somewhere in that scene. The story is about a woman (maybe the same old woman, maybe not) who I think can see either some certain quality of people who are evil (?) or can stop/travel through short periods of time. This ability is the part I have the most issue remembering, for I cannot exactly explain what it was. I think she traveled to somewhere in Europe (possibly France) and there was a sex scene in the middle of the book where she was very disgusted. I also remember a man, perhaps her love interest, who's name I believe was Richard. It's possible he had another name. Both of those characters were grown adults, maybe 30's-40's. I do not remember the ending of the book. The book was set in a fairly modern setting, possibly in the 1980's (which is when I think it was most likely published), and on Earth. Almost positive that there were no extraterrestrial elements.\n\nThank you to anyone who has any idea what this book could be. I lost it soon after getting my hands on it around 6 years or so ago. It has plagued my mind ever since, even though I do not remember much of what it was about."

They are never wrong, it's always me , its always my fault, and when I correct their toxic behaviour , like for example , them being racist and me correcting them is an issue as in *I should shut up and agree to them as they let me live in their house*\n\nI don't know what to do anymore , I've had multiple suicidal thoughts, and attempts on my wrists as well which they ignored , I stopped talking to them, and they didn't care about it much but since my uncle is visiting, he considers me ignoring mother and grandmother as something rude as he does not know what goes on behind the curtains.\n\nWhenever I confront them about how they treat me and how it's not right, they always dress up their mean words as *we only say this for your well being* , *we just want you to look good* etc. \n\n I have good grades , an ideal student in schools premises, loved by teachers,made some great friends, and had mentally matured earlier than kids my age (at age 10). But I don't need all of this , I just need a  *strong parental figure* in my life who would advice me on things, help me out when I'm confused, talk some wisdom into me, HELP ME BE A KID FOR ONCE"

Sometimes I feel like the spark that would set these reactions off is still there, but I've found a way to (mostly) cut off the fuel supply. Similar story with social/conversational norms, I used to say some pretty ridiculous things that got me scolded by adults (esp my mom who was raised very traditionally)...now I'm hypercautious in social settings and feel afraid to be my true unfiltered self, replaying and ruminating on the day's interactions....brains are wack, eh?",

I've never had success dating beyond a few series of 1-2 dates in college that never went anywhere, and I'm baffled by all the unwritten social rules and how NTs seem to just get it.\n\nIn what limited experience I've had dating, I find myself overthinking mine and my date's words and behaviors, which I think probably leads to me coming across as insecure and/or needy, since this leads to me trying to optimise everything in my brain to what I (probably wrongly) see as minimizing the risk of them losing interest. All that overthinking of course taxes my mental CPU and leaves very little processing power available for paying attention to notoriously subtle queues and body language. I don't really understand how to gauge the flow/stage/progress of a romantic relationship, so I'm never sure whether I'm being too forward or passive. \n\nFor those in here who've had success dating, what do you do to try to go with the flow of it more instead of getting into your own head about every little thing? Have you had more success when you've peeled back the Mask\u2122 sooner rather than later? What are other symptoms/quirks/struggles you have that you feel impede you from understanding how to dance this elusive, intricate dance of dating that NTs just seem to intuitively get?\n\nAlso...is this date basically opening the door metaphorically and literally for things to get more intimate if they so trend that way? I've never gone on a date before that wasn't in a public/open location, so not quite sure what to expect on that front. Regardless, I'm glad at least my brother and his girlfriend will be there to help facilitate conversation and hopefully minimize awkwardness."

It's been pretty chilly here in the PNW the past few days (mid 20s/low 30s once it's dark) and the past 2 times I've driven it completely cold after work, the trans popped out of first gear with a startling thud after reversing out of my parking spot (shifting directly into first after stopping -> clutching out of reverse) just after fully releasing the clutch pedal and rolling forward a few feet. Besides that, first and all other gears behave normally once the trans is warmed up (some typical notchy/rough shifts when she's still cold) but no grinding. I only do this when absolutely necessary, but downshifting to 1st without double clutching moving <5mph is still possible, so I think/hope the 1st gear synchro is probably ok. Shifting to 1st from reverse has always felt different than just going to 1st normally from neutral, so it's possible these incidents have been a combination of cold temps + me being careless and not pushing the shifter fully into first.\n\nI do know about the worn shifter seat/bushing fix and may look into that - has anyone experienced similar symptoms caused that? I'd hate to have the trans built, but do have the $ if it comes to it. Sometimes entering 3rd/5th feels a little funky, so I suppose possibly the front ends of the bushing/seat might be toast. I bought the truck at \\~185k and to my knowledge they've never been replaced."

I honestly had a much easier time learning in university lectures. Feels like I'm left in the dust and I fear my boss thinks I'm weird or slow.

Although she seems comfortable with it, I have heard Tom's of stories from people whose cramp periods got worse, that bleed for months until the wound cured, and that It cant be used if you use a menstrual cup (which i do and i dont plan on changing. The pads irritate me easily)\n\nAlso heard the testimony of a college that got the arm injectable, and she said the hormonal charge ita worse than the pills, appart from getting overweight and almost depressed because of it.\n\n\nso yeah, let me hear you!"

Never with best friends or partners tho.\n\nEverytime there are different opinions, it all goes normally, I give my point of view and hear the other. But for some reason i start to escalate thigs to the point of getting emotional and defensive. I dont know why. \n\nEg: I was recently discussing about Driving safety measurements. My grandma (whom I'm currently staying with) claimed that she was scared of me driving alone at night because of thieves that could break windows and such. Hense why she accompanied me yesterday to leave my BF on his house at 1 am. It is true that we live in a third world country were it is pretty common to be threatened by a knife to give up your purse. Yet because she's not from my city, she has the idea that the area is dangerous, where it's not when you're moving around inside a car. Sure  on a Wednesday night there's no one to be seen on the streets but the worst that could happen to me was a car accident/crashing, not a violent thief attack. That could happen to anyone, myself included.\n\n\nSo yeah somehow, I got carried away because I was being contradicted and contradicted, I got emotional when my grandma saw me getting red and asked what was wrong with me. This scenarios happen daily with my parents whom I have way more escalated confrontations, but I hate that I happens with me and other people, I end up feeling like people are calling me stupid or something....so, what advise do you have for this scenarios?\n\n\nPD: Haha post got deleted because I needed to put ages in the title.

After many issues with my own parents at home, specially my mom, I reached the point were i just accept that the stuff i do will never be enough for them (being an A Uni student, doing most chores at home, not being troublesome...). \n\nIts been 3 years since the last time my dad said he was proud of me (after finishing school with A's). I dont remember my mom ever saying so honestly. Even tho I'm 20 Its pretty normal for me to be anxious when they are around, as I feel anytime soon they'll  brust the door open and start scolding me for anything. I've developed so much anxiety that i eat my own nails and hair, and i've started to pay a psychologist behind their backs in order to get better. \n\nSo, I jokingly say i dont think i wanna have kids whenever the matter comes up, and they all laugh it off. But sometimes I do believe my words. I fear having smaller people dependant on me, traumatized by my actions (voluntarily or not) and having to seek help outside of me, BECAUSE of me. Because I've had so many bad experiences that I dont want that burden of ruining someone's life in me.\n\n\nBut then Bluey started trending. And me being an animation lover I watched this Australian pre-schoolers cartoon. I cried hard with some episodes. There's the episode \"bicycle\" where kids learn to LEARN new things, and the adult in the show doesn't taunt or laught at them from not knowing. You are not born knowing after all. That's something I would have loved to hear whenever my family laught historically at me for being confused.\n\nThat is just one small of the many examples of wisdom this show has to offer. Stupid I know, but after watching it, I started to have hope. I fear less the idea of having kids. I know we are talking about an idealistic cartoon but Man, I wanna be like the parents in that show. Atleast by having them as examples maybe I'll turn out better than my own parents. I wanna tell my kids constantly how proud I am of their small achievements, I wanna make them feel safe with me, that they can trust me with their insecurities and that I wont laugh at them from it. I really wanna be a supportive parent for them, If i ever have kids."

Victimizing herself, making you feel a freak whenever you think something different from her, minimizing your feelings and telling you to \"be an adult and suck them up\".

I realised my sister was her \"golden child\" because she liked more girly stuff. whereas I am looked like and alien and questioned my tastes in...all.\n\nI feel at threat at home, constantly.

But when I come back its always the same story: I step a foot on the house and a scolding comes. That I' constantly out, that she need me at home to do chores, etc.\n\nThanks to the psychologist I've realised the amount of anxiety that caused me: eating hair, nails, not being able to cope with stress normally, being overly emotional lately and having tons of pressure over me. I've been paying it on my own for 3 months now. Unfortunately I've spent almost all my saving on it. I dont have a job (cant aford one because of studies either) and honestly I'm far from being able to let go of this psychologist. So I know it's time to talk to the about this.

They won\u2019t follow your orders until you physically hurt them. I was beaten up quiet a bit frequently. I never knew spanking is supposed to be something mild and not something that leaves you in complete vain. I grew up being told that I am a regret and that I would have been better burnt alive   \n\n\nI thought it\u2019s only abuse if it always left bruises and scars and was life threatening to my health. Most of the blemishes I was left with didn\u2019t last a week but some did and the worst one was when I was kicked enough times on the back that I was left with my entire back bruised in purple and green. I have to even try to hide it because apparently according to my mom, these are \u201chouse secrets\u201d and if I ever tell anyone, I would get beaten up for it as well. If I ever come up crying to a family gathering or if they notice my bruises or scars and I tell them who did that, I would be put in hell after. My mom would usually tell them that I do this shit for attention. I started cutting myself at 11 and my defense was \u201cit\u2019s only ok when you do it to me. Not when I do it to myself\u201d  \n\n\nMy mom is very unpredictable. Sometimes she\u2019s in a lighter mood and tells us how much she loves us then other times she is ready to beat me for anything. I usually kept hiding from her starting somewhere around my early teens. If she comes back home exhausted/sleepy/angry/sad for whatever reason, I am in danger regardless of what little I have ever done. And it was only after I wasn\u2019t even a child anymore that I acknowledged that this wasn\u2019t just strict parenting but genuine abuse\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to simply go downstairs when I feel threatened but now I do so all the time. In fact I prefer sleeping downstairs on the coach. Sure a part of it has to do with my sensitivity to cold but a huge part of it is wanting to stay as far away from my mom. In fact I get anxious just listening to her speak. There was a day when my sister was not at home so I can keep my room free of that air conditioner being turned on and I was too anxious to sleep because I am only a wall apart from my mom. I can\u2019t stay around her without getting shivers all the time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nand I hate when people justify this type of behavior for the sake of discipline when the parents are clearly coping by beating up their child. No I didn\u2019t stop doing the things I was beaten up for. I simply found ways to do them in secret with a side of fear and mental health problems that I have to go to therapy for. I don\u2019t want to have children because I fear suddenly finding myself repeating what my mom did."

I just thought my mom wants the best for me and thought \u201coh but my mom wants me to be disciplined so it can\u2019t be bad.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am the type of person to separate my feelings from my mind which means that I would have an opinion on it. Often I think that I either deserved it or it was to keep me from being a spoiled brat. Everything ends with me concluding that I need to acknowledge why it\u2019s happening and it always screamed to me as being more important than what\u2019s happening. I won\u2019t listen to my feelings as long as my mind doesn\u2019t agrees with it not being my fault.   \nSo I never really validated how hurt I felt from my mom\u2019s beating except for the times my mom mindlessly beating me up. And yes she had days where she was moodier so it felt chaotic to even try to figure out why. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have so many stories but a part of having stressful events is that I either remember every last detail or forget a huge blotch of it or almost all of it. There was one in particular that I have remembered suddenly after completely disappearing out of my memories for 4 years and that kinda made me come to the thought:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomewhere around the age of 14, I was beaten up to the point where I woke up the next day and my whole back was colored in purple and green. I was either kicked continuously on the back or beaten up with a cloth hanger (like most occasions where I am beaten up. It\u2019s always the cloth hanger). My memory is weak with this one so all I remember are the injuries and me being beaten up around early morning so I don\u2019t even remember why did that happen.   \nWhat I remember is that my grandma saw the injuries because apparently I was wearing an off shoulder top and my mom was angry because I was \u201cshowing off\u201d what she did to me when really I wasn\u2019t even trying. Me telling anything about my mom beating me up to my grandmother grinds her gears because it\u2019s a \u201chouse secret\u201d but also my grandmother always ends up telling me that my mom just wants me to be the best and a good daughter so I stopped telling her and kept shut about it. However it made me just resort to SH later because I felt stuck in my situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSure I always avoid family gatherings and keep myself in an empty room in family gatherings (and everyone thinks I am insane for that) but I just fear my mom punishing me for any misbehaviors so I distance myself (besides that, fuck pressuring me to eat and the body shaming that often took place. I was also bullied by my cousins when I was little and still can\u2019t get over it). But I constantly find myself isolating at home as well. I keep myself downstairs because I am scared of my mom. I hate how fast is she to acting furious with me. I feel my stress levels climbing when I stay a minute with her. Whenever I\u2019m in the car with my mom, I play the loudest possible songs on my headphones to avoid any attacks from her. It\u2019s fight or flight and I chose flight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni felt guilty even writing this. She is still my mother and she supports me. It\u2019s not as if she didn\u2019t work so damn hard to bringing me here but I\u2019m morbidly scared of her in ways I don\u2019t even see. I love my mom but I\u2018m damaged."

If I asked him, he would answer the questions, but he\u2019s not opening up on his own accord either. It\u2019s not just the relationship thing, also other deeper things in general. There was some in the beginning, but it\u2019s all dried up now. We just\u2026. Hang out now. And it\u2019s fun and sweet and nice. But it doesn\u2019t feel like the connection is growing deeper. I feel like there\u2019s much more to him and me. But I don\u2019t feel a desire or a want to go there from him. Sort of thing?\n\nHe\u2019s plenty vocal about liking me and our time together. But to me, it\u2019s starting to feel a bit shallow when I feel like I don\u2019t know much about the real him TM and he\u2019s not exactly pushing to find out more about me.

Help a girl out.\n\nI\u2019m wondering about emotional intimacy in y\u2019all\u2019s relationships, specifically with men. Do you guys feel like they know you? Do you talk about both of your inner motivations, deeper feelings, your past experiences, relationships and your own relationship on any kind of regular basis? Like at least once every 1-2 weeks? \n\nI\u2019m starting to really get confused about whether this is not really to be expected in a relationship. Even though all my female friendships have been very fulfilling in this regard, it\u2019s starting to seem like this just isn\u2019t the case in romantic relationships. I would expect that this person would know you the most, and that the relationship is based on the two of you being genuinely interested in what the other is thinking and feeling regularly, and communicating about it. On top of having discussed both of your past experiences, current and future wants and desires, likes and dislikes in relationships and in general.\n\nIs this an unrealistic expectation? I don\u2019t feel like men are interested in or really apt at this kind of communication. \n\nI met my current partner when he was dating someone else but their relationship was falling apart, and we got together after their break up. I\u2019m incredibly in love but I don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s trying to get to know me on a deeper level or share with me his thoughts and feelings. He specifically said he wasn\u2019t going to ask me about my exes, and this talk feels like it\u2019s taboo almost, which makes me incredibly insecure, anxious and unhappy, of course about his ex. Ultimately it\u2019s just about me being unsure and in the dark regarding what I really mean to him, how he looks at relationships in general and who he is in general. I tried to talk about it but communication about how I feel and why feels like pulling teeth. It went badly and I felt. Like he didn\u2019t get anything.\n\nI am the kind of person that thrives on communication, openness, transparency, openness and connection, but not when the other person doesn\u2019t seem interested or open to it. Am I just expecting too much? Are relationships usually not that much deeper than friendships? \n\nI would like to know your thoughts and experiences regarding how much and what you talk about with your partners!"

The test has a intuition-bias, so there\u2019s a good chance you could be a sensor as well: ESFJ or ESFP.\n\nMost people will tell you: read up on the cognitive functions. ENFP are Ne-Fi-Te-Si and ENFJ are Fe-Ni-Se-Ti. Going by the functions, these types are very very different even though they have almost the same 4-letter code.\n\nNe-Fi for me is a chaotic and curious energy. Typically talk a lot, can friend anyone, a bit odd at times because they need to be authentic and true to their feelings (Fi).\n\nFe-Ni: are more like social chameleons. In my experience can be quite intense people, and possibly less chatty. Fe concerns itself with the values and feelings of others and is interested in comparing people; ie who \u201cranks\u201d higher. Ni makes them insightful and focused.\n\nHope this helps.",

It\u2019s nice to meet you. :)\n\nSo like, you might be wondering about the \u201cT\u201d. Gender is weird. Idk. I\u2019m Trans, I know that, but I\u2019m currently stuck between identify as a feminine Enby or as a full blown girl. So that\u2019s why you get the \u201cT\u201d. I\u2019ve just started on HRT, like, two weeks ago, so I\u2019m very much in the early stage of transition. Living in Texas as a trans person makes dating just a little bit difficult, so here I am.\n\nI\u2019m also neurodivergent. I\u2019m autistic, but my symptoms aren\u2019t severe. I suffer heavily from OCD. Needless to say, this has severely impaired my ability to engage in dating. (I\u2019m not weird. I just need time to find my groove. I promise.) Hopefully that doesn\u2019t frighten you.\n\nOkay, so less of the barriers, let\u2019s move on to me. I\u2019m 21. I\u2019m about 5\u20196\u201d. I\u2019m punk as hell. I\u2019m an anarchist and I play guitar. I love to read. I love to write. I like spirituality and theology. I\u2019m fundamentally a Christian, but I currently follow three separate religious traditions. I live in Texas but I don\u2019t mind doing long distance. I\u2019m an educator by trade. I\u2019ll be return to college in the fall to pursue my teaching degree. I\u2019m bilingual and currently working on a third language. I know ASL as well. I\u2019m passionate about social causes and helping the disabled and populations with some kind of barrier to opportunity, be it blindness deafness, mental handicaps, immigrant status, economic status, or any other barrier. It\u2019s my dream to dedicate my entire life to helping communities that need it.\n\nUm, I don\u2019t know what to say. This is the end. I am kind of bad at talking about myself so this was difficult for me. However, if you think we\u2019d click or if you\u2019re interested in talking at all, please send a dm my way. Thanks! :)"

Sometimes people will think she's a man for like 20 minutes and apologize profusely once they realize, and her reasoning is basically \"it's okay, if I minded, I would have told you.\"\n\nI appear pretty feminine and take some steps to reinforce that (through fashion and hairstyle mainly, but even if I tried to make myself appear masculine or androgynous I'm not sure I'd be very successful without extensive makeup/hormones.) As a result, I wouldn't be offended if someone called me \"he,\" but since it's never happened before I'd assume they were making a weird point of some kind rather than making an honest mistake. Like they're getting 100 feminine cues and ignoring them all for some reason. If I corrected them and they still didn't use she/her pronouns I'd be annoyed (but not like, existentially hurt in the way where it can feel if you're trans because the world is pretty on my side in perceiving me as a girl.)\n\nAlso, being called singular they/them would bother me a little (I'm a woman darn it) but \"they\" is meant to be inclusive I think, so I probably wouldn't correct someone over it. I would correct \"he/him.\"",

You can sort by transfer acceptance rate, too.

As with a lot of for-profit chains, though, resources (grad rates) depended a lot on the location and whether it was online or not. Eventually the whole thing buckled without warning (I think bankruptcy was involved,) and a bunch of students were essentially kicked out of the program they had been paying for sans a degree. Some other schools offered paths for these students to automatically/easily transfer, but it wasn\u2019t easy for them.\n\nAnyway, I won\u2019t call out specific schools, but beware of for-profit colleges, particularly if they are chains with wildly different outcomes for each school or offer a \u201cper credit/per quarter\u201d program billed at being good for busy work schedules (but overall much more expensive if you complete a degree.)",

That statement might sound obvious, but I've seen a lot of posts in a moment of frustration complain about stuff like \"you can't win with immigrant parents,\" when what they really mean is \"you can't win with MY parents; anyone feel the same way?\"\n\n\"Immigrant parent\" has become a shorthand on this sub for \"pushy, academically-obsessed, and abusive,\" and that's quite the shame in my opinion. Saying they're all one way is a pretty broad collector for those whose parents are perfectly chill and don't get talked about much on this sub, and leads to clueless posts like \"I feel so bad for those with Asian parents!\" \n\nThere's no need to demonize someone's background, which is literally out of their control. Demonizing unhealthy behaviors would be more productive.\n\nAnd once more to clarify, I still think people should feel free to vent about parents being abusive or controlling or just annoying on this sub, and should feel free to speak about their family background and how it influences their dynamics. I also think discussions about how certain cultural values influence attitudes toward college can be useful and enlightening (one of my best friends has helicopter parents like I do, but the things they said and implied about the future were very different, as we come from different cultural backgrounds. It was interesting and a bit of a relief to discuss this with her.) \n\nBut please try not to bucket all people from a category into specific behaviors, positive or negative."

The scent isn\u2019t my favorite (very dessert-y, reminds me of marzipan), but I love the bouncy texture, how it lathers, and how moisturizing it is. So I decided I want to buy a full sized shower gel in a different scent, I just don\u2019t know which one. I\u2019m going for something with a woodsy, warm, and spicy feeling. More on the spicy side than the sweet side. Sadly I haven\u2019t tried very many lush products so I don\u2019t have much to reference. The only scent on my radar right now is Lord of Misrule since I\u2019ve heard so many good things about it, though I\u2019ve also heard it doesn\u2019t lather very well. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!"

The only spells I can think of right now are teleport and scrying, both of which are much higher level.\n\nSecondly interaction issues is how it affects the action economy and because it is random it all too often will waste the player's turn. You roll, you get magic weapon, spend an action casting a bonus action spell, and maybe there's no one in your party close enough to benefit from it. Completely wasted action. You roll, you get fireball, except maybe you're in a tiny tavern and deal damage to everyone including that NPC you needed. You roll, you get vampiric touch, maybe no enemy within reach. \n\nUltimately it's a gimmick and ends up being a trap feature. Good luck with your workshopping.\n\nEdit: to clarify - trying to replicate spells they've seen but do not have access to is what's going to cause the misunderstanding re: choice of spells that go poorly in my hypotheticals. That means they also have access to literally every spell in the game of a certain level, because they just have to have seen it.",

                "body": " \n\nPaper Airplanes projects are excellent \u201chands-on\u201d applications of different notions and theories regarding the aircraft flight. If you already have some knowledge about the real planes design now is the time to put them in practice. If you are a beginner, it\u2019s a good moment to ignite your child interest for aeronautics and to set the base for further studies.  \n\n\nWorking with paper airplanes will give your child the chance to explore, design, redesign and even do independent study. If he is artistically talented, he will be excited to decorate the plane (avoid water based paints). You can organize this project in many ways and use the following information according to your child age and familiarity with the aerodynamics.\n\n The use of paper airplanes is believed to have originated 2,000 years ago in China . The earliest known date of the creation of modern paper planes was said to have been in 1909. However, the most accepted version of the creation was two decades later in 1930 by Jack Northrop (Co-founder of Lockheed Corporation). \n\n \n\nDesign of paper models is an attractive pursuit, as design of wings and other surfaces can be completely in-scale by tracing flight surfaces with precision. Further, CAD software can be used in plotting the shapes of wings, tail planes and other components for easy reproduction of parts for assembly.\n\nWith care, it is even possible to color in a model airframe before construction commences, or print patterns upon it during the process of reproduction.\n\n## How Paper airplanes fly?\n\nWhen a plane flies, he moves through the air. In the absence of the air, the flight of an aircraft it is impossible to be controlled. The layer of air that surrounds the earth is called the atmosphere and is composed of 78.09 percent nitrogen,20.05 percent oxygen, 0.93 percent argon and 0.03 percent other gases. Air contains also water vapors and it is in a constant motion due to the differences in temperature between different places on earth.\u00a0\n\nImagine that we live on a bottom of an ocean of air where the pressure decreases with altitude. The air has weight, which is expressed as pressure. The higher up in the \u201cocean\u201d you go, the less air you have on top of you (low pressure).\n\nThere is a direct relation between the air properties and the wing design that you have to consider when you build a plane. There are four forces that act on a plane in flight:\n\n* Thrust: the force, which pushes the plane forward through the air.\n* Drag: the resistance the air exerts on the forward motion of a plane (drag oppose thrust)\n* Weight: it pulls the plane down because the force of gravity\n* Lift: the upward force that counteracts gravity and keeps the plain in the air.\n\nFor additional information and suggested experiments about some of the principles involved in flight check this\u00a0[link.](http://www.aviation-for-kids.com/Lift.html) \n\nWhen you will design your plane think about all this forces. Basically your plane will glide through the air so one of the most important things you will have to consider is the shape of the wings. A good wing shape will provide a high lift/drag ratio, which is the same as the glide ratio (the distance a plane will glide divided by its altitude).\n\nThe weight of a plane divided by the surface area of the main wing is called the wing loading. Planes with high wing loads glide faster and have a high rate of descent than planes with low wing loads, which are good gliders. For example, the winning plane in the duration aloft category from the 1st International Paper Airplane Contest was essentially a sheet of paper folded in half.\n\n## Paper Planes experiments\n\nBesides learning about paper airplanes and building them you can also do some simple experiments.The easiest is to build different models and see which one will fly further and which one will glide longer.Talk with the science teacher and organize a little contest at school.If you need more ideas and information about paper planes I recommend the excellent site of\u00a0[Ken Blackburn](http://www.paperplane.org/about.html)\u00a0He currently holds a Guinness Book of World Record for time aloft for paper airplanes (27.6 seconds).\n\n \n\nIf you don\\`t know what paper airplane to use in your experiments,I will suggest to do a simple search on Google. You will find many web sites that offer great plans and with folding instructions so I will not waste you time here.Experiment with different designs and compare the results.\n\nThe new world record for the longest flight (27.9 sec) of an paper airplane was set by **Taku Toda**.,a Japanese engineer. The design measured 10 cm from tip to tail and it\u2019s made of a single sheet of folded paper with no cuts.\n\nThe flight took place at a competition in Hiroshima Prefecture in April and and it was confirmed by Guinness World Records.\n\nMr.Toda is the head of the Japan Origami Airplane Association and his interest in paper airplanes started 30 years ago while is was in convalescence after a climbing accident while at university.He founded his association in 1980 and he managed to convince the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to invest 90 million yen(around 756,000 US dollars) in a three-year study of the feasibility of launching paper darts from the International Space Station back to Earth.The darts are expected to return in about a week and this experiment might provide new data about aerodynamics and the use of ultra-light materials in the design of spacecrafts."

I preface this by saying, you didn't do anything wrong.\n\nBut, if you want to understand her reaction, it's likely to be this: \nIf she assumed that you too were only seeing her in a platonic way, then asking her out would have come as a shock. In the moment, it would be like, \"Oh, I have enjoyed spending time with this person though. Maybe we can work through it and still spend time together anyway?\"\nBut afterwards, in hindsight, suddenly the whole friendship seems like a lie. \"He was only hanging around because he wanted to get into my pants. It all had an ulterior motive. I've been played.\"\n\nI emphasise: you didn't do anything wrong by asking her out. But it can be difficult to salvage a friendship afterwards. Maybe she'll come around. Maybe not. Either way, your best bet moving forward is to leave the ball in her court and respect her boundaries.",

Also I'm not an English speaker so excuse the grammar mistakes please.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for quite a while. I started working out more the past few months (boxing, general work out), and my girlfriend had an idea of doing the same (working out). I'm quite lean in build with developing muscle, and my girlfriend has a history of playing sports vigorously. She knows her stuff. I've never been a sport's person. Due to personal complications, she had to stop, and her muscles had weakened over time, as muscles do.\n\nShe's also quite skinny, and whilst this doesn't bother me in any way, shape or form (she's beautiful, I love her so much and her health is important to me), she's quite self-conscious about her physique and the fact that she's so thin. She's been trying to gain weight (higher calorie intake), but nothing seems to be working, and she continues to get skinnier, which I'm worried about, but I know some body types are that way. She works long shifts, balances uni, me, and her own personal life between everything, and I try to be as supportive and open-minded with her business as I can, because we always make time to spend with each other no matter how busy life gets. We eat together any meal we can, which is often everything in the day, counting snacks.\n\nHere's the core of the \"issue\": we all have bad days. Like it or not, we all do, but we get through them. \n\nIt hurts seeing my girlfriend get pulled into this mindset of self-deprecation and shame. She isolates herself from any physical affection and feels too ugly to be touched, and whilst I don't touch her as she doesn't want to be, I let her know she's not ugly in any way. Whenever she tells me this, I let her know how beautiful she is, how these features don't make her any less in any way, that she's lovely and gorgeous and that every person is different, and her's are beautiful to me, etcetera. Oftentimes it helps to just... Talk about it. Likewise we give each other space if we need it, and are careful about what and when we say what we do. \n\nIs there anything I can do for my girl to support her more in some way? Whilst comfort is not an issue, and confidence is internal (kind of like a muscle, the more you build it, the stronger it is), I really want to help her in some way be more comfortable with herself on her \"off\" days. I feel like words can only do so much, but I want to find a way I can lift her up from the water without letting her drown in these thoughts. We've been considering working out together, but with her limited time, I want to find another way I can support her. \n\nTL;DR: my girlfriend's hard days about her body get her down quite heavily and I want to support her more in any way I can"

                "body": "Btw most fashion trends recycle every 20 years but mostly looking glamorous and dressing up is still looked down upon, because \u201ceFfOrTLeSs\u201d beauty is the trend atm.\n\ni don\u2019t know which flair to use besides advice but i\u2019d be glad to help you out finding your three main styles (it doesn\u2019t have to be 1 particular one since you\u2019re not a 2D character lol). I\u2019ll include a TL;DR for finding your style faster (lowkey quizz).\n\nMy 2020-2016 style\n\n- oversized Tees\n- shorts \n- distressed jeans/anything distressed\n- comfortable clothes\n- sneakers\n- mini dresses and skirts\n- denim (ngl i actually have a big dislike for denim rn)\n- stripes\n- stiff clothes\n- wannabe edgy alt girl look (i wanted to have a alt look since 2016, i still like the music but looking back at some clothes...)\n- wearing mostly black in 2020 (because i didn\u2019t feel confident in other colors for some reason)\n\n(I honestly went from 2016 Kardashian style, 2017-2019 kpop idol inspo, 2020 wanting to try alt) \n\nMake up: matte make up, sharp eyeliner. Darkened eyebrows. Mostly harsh and little to no soft ness at all (which didn\u2019t work for my high trust features).\n\nPros: not attracting any public attention\nCons: not feeling confident at all, never have the mood feeling my best and prettiest. It made me feel really below average. Attracting more people with toxic low self esteeem.\n\n\u2014 \n\nIn 2021 when i finally found my style\nI looked for (basically i found my femininity again). And accepting that you don\u2019t have to act like what you feel and say, accepting your own \u201cparadoxity\u201d.\n\nThe fabrics i wanted to wear: mine is soft and thinner fabrics like silk and satin.\n\nClothes: dresses! I never felt more amazing in them especially midi dresses! Waist emphasis (tucking in your shirt, belting, not having oversized tees). Avoiding prints, i just like having one color.\n\nHow i want to be: wanting to be seductive and hot (femme fatale inspo), yet mysterious and calm appearance at the same time (ethereal like, serenity). \n\nKnowing my best colors: neutrals (from white to browns, often i\u2019ll wear black but never greys), soft and muted cool colors.\n\nAlways adding glittery and shiny jewellery to complete the look (so simple yet elegant).\n\nI found out i\u2019m really fond of gloves: searching for your accessories. Search for your signature look.\n\nMake up: soft eye make up, blush usage, lipgloss, letting my eyebrows as it is.\n\nShoes: heels and boots!\n\nExtra: doing more things with my hair than only putting it in ponytails and let it loose; half up half down/elven like hairstyle, curling it more often.\n\nI Speak slower to tone my voice down (which makes my voice sounds calmer and more approachable, been insecure about it since people tell me it\u2019s annoying and ugly.)\n\nAttitude: becoming more aloof, acting dumb and not telling everything. Saves you from a lot of drama and stress.\n\nHanging out with people that aren\u2019t unsupportive. And finally getting to know my selfworth.\n\n\u2014\n\nTL;DR\n\nHow to find your style (a journey for yourself). More in a quizz like text if you don\u2019t mind that.\n\n- have 3 styles (or even better described as archetypes/essence) that you definitely like: search for what you want to be/accentuate. \n\n- what fabrics work for you?\n\n- which colors harmonise you and make you pop?\n\n- what necklines makes you look amazing? (Trust me they\u2019re important)\n\n- have you got high trust features? Try for softer looking make up. Have you got low trust features? Sharp and precise make up is something you can try.\n\n- do you look good in elongated lines or better in shorter lines?\n\n- do you feel more harmonised with stiff fabrics or soft and flowy fabrics?\n\n- try color blocking (two different colors in one fit) or go for a monochrome outfit to see which one you might like better. Maybe you like both."

I do believe I have a gamine essence, but I honestly feel like when I weighed more, gamine lines looked THE WORST on me; I believe the only reason I can pull them off now is because I\u2019m considerably thinner. \n\nWhich brings me to my point: do you think I got branded a gamine because of the prevailing belief online that naturals can\u2019t look \u201cthin\u201d? Another comment I got was that my proportions didn\u2019t look blended enough to be a soft natural. But couldn\u2019t thinness bring out a sort of bony-ness in the wrists and ankles that mimics juxtaposition? \n\nPlease correct me if I\u2019m getting anything wrong, I\u2019ve only known about kibbe for a little over a year.\n\nEDIT: I have removed my BMI; furthermore, I did not realize essence cannot differ from actual body type (I watched several YouTube videos that insist otherwise), so please disregard the part about my \u201cgamine essence.\u201d"

After years of seeking help, reading books, looking into programs, practicing both obsessively and non-obsessively/without expectation by myself and with partners nonstop, I finally got to a point where I decided to just stop thinking about it. That helped for about a year or two, but now the desire is back and it's making me depressed again. \n\nWhat's problematic I think is that people keep assuring non-orgasmic people that they CAN do it, they just have to be patient and keep trying. **But some people have patiently tried for decades, and they still can't orgasm. So wouldn't it be better to just accept that life is fine without orgasming, and recognize that trying to get some people to think otherwise is actually harming rather than helping them?**\n\nPerhaps I've answered my own question. But I'd just like to know if anyone out there in my position has come to terms with their condition in a way that brings them peace, acceptance, and even joy. It's hard for me to feel that way in a world that glorifies this shit like you're incomplete or lacking or miserable if you've never orgasmed."

I don\u2019t want to talk about it too much since this ordeal has been traumatic, and my whole body tightens approaching the hospital.\n\nMy dad\u2019s been chronically ill for a while and now he\u2019s strapped to tubes and machines and bullshit. We were expecting this but not so soon. He\u2019s gotten so skinny now and is in critical condition.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the best dad, far from that actually, but he\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve known. Grappling with his past abusive behaviour with the good moments with him to his now fragile state has been hard. \n\nIt\u2019s so unfair how I feel this expectation to \u201cdeal with it\u201d like an adult, because I am one, but I\u2019m still a kid if that makes sense. Since I was a kid he\u2019s been sick, and talking about death. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised and I\u2019m not, but it feels like a dull pain that hasn\u2019t hit me yet. \n\nI feel like I don\u2019t deserve as much help or kindness since I\u2019m technically not losing him as a minor or a young child, but I\u2019m resentful of all the times that would have never and will never happen. He won\u2019t see me go to college one day or get my first promotion or see me get married or see his grandkids. I\u2019ve made peace with that but it hurts. He\u2019s a fucking dick but I miss him, but he\u2019s still here.\n\nThe doctors told us to be ready in case of the worst. I feel like it was my fault; I got covid from my 18th birthday out with friends in July and he got it from me. His health was a downwards spiral since then. It\u2019s my fault and I should\u2019ve been more responsible or reasonable.\n\nI don\u2019t know, I just had to ramble a bit. I have a supportive boyfriend but he\u2019s going through a lot too. So yeah. Please be gentle, I can\u2019t really handle much atm."

It won't be guaranteed, but this way you'll use less pearls, I only pulled 25 times on her gacha and got her using this method. \n\nNote that the pity system on cookie run works for the other gachas, so you can do this to get costumes or treasures too.

I had two ER visits this year for severe pain which prompted ultrasounds each time and MRI. \n\nNaturally, after discovering a 7 cm cyst on my right ovary and a smaller one on my left, they just said you have hemorrhagic cysts on both ovaries and maybe showed me a single ultrasound picture. This was in February.\n\nSo what did I do? I requested copies of every single ultrasound session (because I've had previous ER visits in 2011 and 2016 for the same pain) and MRI. I studied them, I read medical studies to understand what to look for, what meant what, compared pictures, watched videos, etc. \n\nMy first observation: these were endometriomas, not hemorrhagic cysts, which are easily confused to an \"untrained eye\"- they shouldn't be. They look different.\nMy second observation: I had kissing ovaries. An additional major clue of what was happening inside.\nMy third observation: in 2011 when I had my first ever ER visit because of this type of pain, as a wee high schooler, they blatantly ignored the fact that my white blood cell count was THROUGH the roof. I'm talking double what it should be. But they found no cysts, dismissed it as a period and sent me away. But I compared my bloodwork from the 2016 & 2022 ER visit, where both times I was told cysts, and what would you know? Identically skyrocketed WBC. It's almost like I was actually suffering something \ud83d\ude31\ud83e\udd2a\n\nApril rolls around and I have my follow up. What did the doctor actually do at my follow up appt atter my first ER visit? Said yeah these are hemorrhagic and tried to refer me to a reproductive specialist. As if that was my concern. \n\nEnded up in the ER for the second time just three days after this follow up appt. Queue a third round of ultrasound. They tell me well it's partially ruptured so yeah it *was* *for sure* a hemorrhagic cyst. \n\nI still didn't buy it. But THANKFULLY, after having studied my own ultrasounds after the first ER visit in February, I independently sought out a Nook specialist. I blew through my deductible so it was like fuck it, I'm doing this. \n\nFast forward to my surgery 9/20/22: stage IV endometriosis. Bilateral endometriomas with adhesions sticking my ovaries together and to my uterus and to other nearby tissue. Endometriosis on my bladder, cul de sac, bowels, fallopian tube (amongst other places I can't name) and deep infiltrating endometriosis on my ovaries. Fibrotic scar tissue in several areas from who knows how long of my body trying to fight the endo. Adhesions. Lesions. The whole right endometrioma was larger than my uterus. Yeah, you read that right. Not my ovary- the cyst itself was larger than the uterus. \n\nAnd to think that absolutely none of this would have been discovered or removed by my local hospital because they were just heMoRhaGic cYstS (insert SpongeBob meme). It blows my mind.",

I'm about 2 hours into sleep and jolt awake with this excruciating sharp pains below my belly button. Not to one side or the other like usual where the sharp pain seems to extend for several inches across the expanse of my stomach,  no. This felt like there were hot crystals all centered below my belly button just sending off lightning bolt type sharp pains that were in quick succession and constant.  Coupled with a vaginal and/or anal contracting feel, I think. I was so tired and so confused and concerned. I almost woke up my partner to go to the ER. I thought food poisoning even, but I didn't have a fever, sweats or nausea so I was like that can't be right. \n\nI immediately reached for hydrocodone which I've have since my last ER visit. It did nothing for it. The pain was constant and it remained for hours. The only good the medicine did for me was that it allowed me to fall asleep through the pain because my body was so exhausted. \n\nI've had trouble all morning since I woke up. Peeing gave me severe sharp pains that took my breath away, made me nauseous and caused my blood pressure to drop. I had to throw myself on the floor to keep from passing out. I've felt faint nearly every time I stand. \n\nSo exhausted. I have laparascopy in September. I can't wait, I just want answers. If it isn't endo then I'm going to feel hopeless."

However it is stated in the book that Vardaman wasn't being metaphorical but completely serious about it, he really thought that his mother was a fish so i'm not convinced with my interpretation, why did Vardaman said his mother was a fish? Or what's the importance of it in the story? I might need to read the book again so i can understand better but the spanish translation is confusing and sometimes i get lost."

I am also taking Wellbutrin and Strattera which seems to be doing a waaaay better job then any stimulant ever. I quit smoking weed a few days ago, and am currently tryna quit cigarettes (up to 0! a day instead of a pack a day if not more). I also noticed a cognitive difference in video games (much better at it) when taking Omega 3 and vitamin D together, since the two are linked to serotonin production and function. I also needed glasses (If you need them and don\u2019t have them it can give you depression, among other shit you don\u2019t want). If you have any questions you know what to do!\n\nEDIT:\n\nSo after some research and googling everything from time and space to your mom I found that I have Adrenal Fatigue and obviously ADHD/SCT but who knows for how long? (Terrible symptoms that is). I have for the past week been gathering all the supplements that I require to function normally. The supplements are: Omega 3, Vitamin D, Vitamin B Complex, Magnesium, Coq10 (Coenzyme Q10, Strattera depletes this, also is recommended for ages 30+ but you won\u2019t know if it helps till you try!), Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Iron and Zinc. After a bit of research I have found these Vitamins/supplements to be key to brain function as well as just healthy bodily function (DO NOT TAKE ALL THESE VITAMINS AT ONCE), also waking up at 8 am and sleeping at 11-1pm/am has worked very well for my Adrenal Fatigue but it\u2019s still present. Will eventually workout max three times a week and take part in a fighting style for overall health. I will update in a week from now to show results.\n\nUpdate: \n\nI now just take a Multivitamin, fish oil, eat a balanced diet (MIND diet), exercise 3-6 times a week (3 days weight training and 3 days running), quit vaping, use a bruxism mouthguard, and take creatine for working out. All this has helped tremendously! I\u2019m slowly getting better each day (Memory is also getting better cause I\u2019m getting Omega 3 now) in all aspects. I recommend finding your personality type cause a lot of INTJS (My personality type) often are diagnosed ADHD because of simply how we are as a people so I don\u2019t know if I had adhd or not but I\u2019m done taking medications and am now doing things the healthy way first then I\u2019ll see a year down the road if I need them (Prob not)."

They told me to contact customer support, and to my surprise, after a day or two, I got an email that the problem was resolved. I was instructed to try to redeem the Card now and that I do not hesitate if I run into any other problems, but instead contact them further.\n\nAs promised, everything went smoothly! Virtual Card activated, physical one ordered, and I even made my first purchase already.\n\nThank you Nexo for not letting me down. Although it really would be great if I were in fact able to use my real name and surname in the future :')"

Calling a historic series meaningless in favor of a franchise league where the kits look like crisp or biscuit packets and the logos are designed by Fiverr artists is peak irony.\n\nSome people here also act like it's a war crime to want players to prioritize their country - the system that made them - over cheap bucks. It's very convenient to push this narrative that all bilateral are meaningless and IPL >> because your opinion on what International players should do with their careers (and therefore lives) is moot since it all circles to \"you shouldn't judge people\": free will and all. There is validity in that, but there is (and has been) moral and societal degradation with this line of thought. CA has done the balanced thing here and stood there ground.\n\nIt's the equivalent of following, say, some online content creator for years (since their early days) and seeing their new fanbase become an increasing toxic hivemind. When you say you don't like the direct things are going, you're going to be told, \"just leave? why are you even on this sub/channel?\". Uh, I have a right to voice my opinion and think that their content has degraded because they prioritize money over quality?\n\nThe only reason these people say IPL isn't meaningless is because for every 1 person who doesn't like it, there are 100 people (mostly Indian fans) who enjoy it. So the hivemind prevails. Because if bilaterals and historic tours are meaningless, then so is franchise cricket by that definition: if not more meaningless than International cricket. Slowly this meaningless bilateral mindset is just giving the IPL more leverage in the International calendar. Just because I cannot judge a player's career choices since it's up to them, doesn't mean I cannot find it wrong for them to prioritize money over national prestige. This is so twisted to begin with: that you feel wrong for cricketers going for money over their nation as though they don't already earn a fuck ton.\n\nLike, if a woman you are interested in tells you they are transgender, you are well within your grounds to not want to date them and not be transphobic. Or if a male/female partner does Onlyfans or sex work, you are within your rights to not want to date/marry/whatever them and not be shat on.\n\nJust how things are and have always been. Not judging someone doesn't mean you have to compromise your morals. Chasing the money as though these cricketers don't already have enough is just leading to the moral and structural degradation of International cricket and that's a fact.  Cricket has the right to stay an International (and not club-oriented sport), and you have the right to feel this way. This Aus-Pak tour and fulfilling Intl duties isn't meaningless: chasing money as though they don't already make enough through the IPL is arguably so.\n\nPeople love to act all prude when it comes to money here. There was a thread about IPL players not being paid enough JFC. And then a bunch of under 19s made 50 lacs for winning the U19 cup (mind you, $70k USD - being under 19 years of age) - which is like what an average Indian engineer from a reputable Indian college will make when they graduate multiplied by 4-5 years at best - and people in that thread were going \"yeah, it's decent I guess\". Why are you downgrading the fact that they already make a metric fuck-ton? Why do people say \"let the players decide\" and \"they're just trying to \\[sic.\\] put food on the table\". Fuck me: they're not putting food on the table with 1.5 million dollars  - they're chasing money as though that's all that cricket is about. Not the love of the game, donning your country's colors: just making money money money money money.\n\nThere players don't need more money, fucking hell. They can make more if they want: it's their choice. It's also one's choice (CA) to feel they should be paying back their country in the bounds of their contractual obligations. If IPL franchise owners want to throw a hissy fit, then choose less Australian players and go for the WIndians - look at how the money-chasing and orientation toward power-hitting and appeasing franchise cricket has ruined their International cricket and cricketing board. But, ah, yes - let's make International cricket a commonality between PIG3, dry out the rest of the boards, and play IPL for the other six months of a year.\n\nIf Australian players want to chase money as though they already won't make enough in their careers, then feel free. You don't need to have a contract with your cricketing board and fulfill its obligations. Terminate the contract, play franchise cricket all year, if you expect your board to bow down to BCCI - because get fucked, they shouldn't. There are enough people waiting to represent their country and showcase their talent in all three International formats instead of some franchise league which'll never match the quality of an International game because of its very seasonal and individualistic nature.\n\nOf course Indians following the IPL will say \"I mean, let the players choose\", \"they need to PuT fOoD oN thE tAbLE\". They don't care. They play a metric shit-tonne of cricket all year, fans wait for talents to play against poorer teams so that they can show up for PIG3 tours or NZ/Pak rivalries, and have a personal connection with the IPL because it promotes their national/domestic talent. I'm sure if BBL or CPL or PSL was in question over here and players would go off to make a million bucks in two months over there, these very people wouldn't be saying \"let the players choose to skip out on a historic tour for big bucks\", \"they need to PuT fOoD oN thE tAbLE\".",

In a way, less competition means less focus on cutthroat competitiveness within the bounds of franchise cricket: which means I see this as an absolute win for Pakistan cricket (as counter-intuitive as it sounds).  \n\nMost of the teams (PZ, LQ in particular) have great talent pathways and scouting has been great. PSL hasn't been there long enough to have enough quality dispersed in 8 teams, especially when all us non-IPL leagues struggle to get plenty (frankly, even a handful) of well-known stars. Emerging talent would get diluted and it would make it just another generic league imo with an emerging talent gimmick in the playing XIs. I love the platform it's been giving some foreign talent this season: I'm perfectly happy if it's an entryway for foreign talent to have it seen as a quality league where they are picked in the IPL thereafter and prove themselves against the best in the format. So as long as that means our emphasis remains on developing local talent and emerging players (great move to have the 1 emerging player/season thing this season), as well as bearing fruit (for our LOI teams). \n\nI'd rather we focus on its entertainment by big names being secondary to the growth of Pakistani cricket - the big ol' Rambo plan. Pakistanis (as evident on casual cricketing spaces) enjoy the league for our talent rather than the big stars, and I love this model because it seems to be helping more than it has helped, say, India with the IPL's big stats and all (as they've not won a T20 WC in the 14-15 years of its induction). \n\nTap more and more into domestic & Intl markets, franchises break even, domestic audience is tapped into all the more, and profits are reinvested in all efforts for bringing CT17 to Pakistan and improving our BTS stuff. At least, seems optimistic with Ramiz (never thought I'd say that sentence). I really like his big picture thinking and proactive YouTuber in him that prepones things (by previous PCB standards)",

He was just pretty poor this season. These are objectively \"pretty bad\" performances for a number 3 in 8 games.\n\nFor argument's sake, he averaged 21.75 at an SR of 94.87 if I did the rough math right. If you take away the scores you took out, then that's still 33.6 at 122.5. Pretty bad for a number 3 (purely in terms of SR in this case) - especially if someone like Babar, who opens, has a median score of like 46-48 at 129-131 in T20Is (or T20s in general for argument's sake)  and that's considered maybe slightly 'above average' opener by International standards. Averaging an average of 13 less at like 8 SR less makes it 'pretty bad' from Clarke per similar standards.

                "body": "Dude if that's KL's then Babar's is literally \"whole USSR against one guy in a portapotty in Poland\". His team, this franchise, their marketing, their thinktank in auction & games, this unlikeable asshole squad, their mank jerseys, their home stadium vibrance, their advertising, their exuberant \"we're number 1\" branding despite being so shit... their tactics, their release of good players etc etc. You could go on and on. They're literal dogshit on steroids.\n\nHere's an average 11 of theirs:\n\n1. Sharjeel the fixing fatso - washed up corrupt fatty who won't run and occasionally gets run-out. Liability in the field that drops easy catches and holds a shit-eating grin\n2. Babar - anchored harder than KL and cannot even accelerate until there's like 2 or 3 overs left but alas, his form went to shit being with this shitshow of a team and management and he's been playing these poor knocks. Can do better but I don't blame him having to carry the psychological burdens of this team for a whole season, copping a 1-9 end to the season\n3. Joe Clarke - alleged rapist/aided his rapist friend with some sick 'numbers game'. Unlikeable shithead that was pretty bad this entire season\n4. Nabi - washed up and past his prime. Has been poor in IPL, BBL for a while and continued that into PSL\n5. Ian Cockbain - pretty bad PSL szn, kinda unknown. If not him, then Babar's Somserset friend Lammonby who was also pretty bad\n   1. If Joe Clarke's not donning the gloves, then Rohail & w/ the gloves - brown Bo Thompson from Superstore who's been touted to have potential but hasn't done much ever. Allegedly spends more time texting minors on Twitter and apparently this had also come to light last season but was just brushed off a bit\n6. Qasim Akram - excellent U19 talent (AR), only positive thing about KK this szn after his late entry. Pray that KK don't fuck him up. Has shown decent promise his last few games but should probably go to Multan or LQ if he really wants to thrive. ISLU isn't a bad option too\n7. Sahibzada Farhan - yes, this very intelligent thinktank will desperately scramble the XI around to the point where one match, Sharjeel's at 3 & Clarke's opening, with Nabi coming in at 6. The next, Farhan - opener in NT20 (SMAT equivalent) - comes down at like 7 or 8 and then is ejected after 2 games\n8. Lewis Gregory - Dan from WeCricket who can hold a bat who can hold a bat a bit to pinch-hit a little. Bits and pieces all-arounder.\n9. Imad Wasim - pretty good and has stopped hiding down the order. Benched Rizwan saying he wasn't good enough to fit in the KK team and now this team's in shambles. My guy's bowling left arm in-swing at 90kph in the PP and playing two good knocks a season to lessen this team's humiliation\n10. Mir Hamza - pretty epic season tbh, he's a good guy. Still, bowling stocks are very very underwhelming. They tried: Shinwari, Aamer Yameen, Muhammad Taha, Muhammad Ilyas (budget Musa Khan who's like dollar store ramen noodles if Naseem Shah was black bean noodles)\n11. Chris Jordan (like 3 games) - meh.\n\nCan score 140/9 (20) on average. So literally couldn't even set or chase anything on par with 170, 180 with midget boundaries in the Karachi leg. In the opener they literally made 124/5 or something.\n\nThey will make 170 in 2 in 10 matches, and that is, if they get their asses saved with some pinch-hitting down the order + Babar striking at 120 before getting out by 12th over. But their bowling and fielding is so shit that they couldn't even defend 200 if they tried. PBKS may have been a shitty IPL team last season/s but my God they weren't this horrendous. Plus, they had big names in their line-up\n\nKarachi end their season 1-9. It's literally a checked out Babar, half a batsman in Imad or Qasim on a given day for half the season, and one impact bowler in Mir in the second half of the season",

Have fallen behind severely finishing my final year without a school, and have \\~2 months to study 6 subjects, and complete \\~8 pieces of coursework\n* Anyone working toward a goal in sight is preferred but not essential - be it JEE/NEET/IBDP/A levels/GCSEs/end of semester at Uni etc.\n* Any timezone, just checking in at night at your timezone and reflecting on your day, thinking out loud if stuck on a task and needing guidance during the day, etc.\n\n**Accountability I'm looking for:**\n\n* Looking to build external and reliable accountability on a daily basis with someone who wants to keep a compassionate but low-energy accountability. Someone who doesn't mind getting straight to the point and being honest with their struggles, needing guidance when stuck\n\n**Mode of communication:**\n\n* Instagram/hangouts would be my preferred method of commination, but I'm not picky. Anything works. No need for voice calls (low energy) - someone who can text is preferred, makes accessibility easier and helps on low-energy days where communication can be tiresome. \n* I usually use [this tracker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/task-timer/ilodecgofagpdifoghkggnaohndgpipb) to track my work, and would probably send an image of this every night and reflect upon it to keep accountability - even on days where I've not gotten out of bed and have done nothing ;P\n\n**Bonus:**\n\n* Someone struggling with mental health issues/executive functioning is a bonus: guidance for one-another's tasks or conversations when avoiding/procrastinating to find clarity helps. I struggle with PTSD and ADHD, so I am prone to getting stuck and freezing for days, getting off-put in my time-sensitive preparation\n* Optional: Also looking to improve my religious faith and keep accountability. Muslim is a bonus, but any faith helps if one is interested. Can be totally ignored during accountability if interested in the above but turned off by this.\n\nCheers."

My peers joke about cheating on my old, mature wives in search for a novel, more exhilarating (and attractive) wife that I stumble across every two weeks.\n\nLike I'm not kidding when I say I used to have (and still do) a collection of 12-15 note-taking, routine-making, calendar, scheduling, sticky notes, random thought scribble, school note, productivity, habit tracking, life organization apps that I would use every single day in this jungled mess of spending years perfecting a system that integrated well for my pea-sized working memory and executive functioning.\n\nAnd I'd spend my entire day making a plan... only to not follow through with anything. I tried every other system - less apps, more apps, one app for all, going cold-turkey and winging it - but once the system lost its novelty, I fell back into my same old habits.\n\nThat was my hyperfixation for two entire years: envisioning having a completely productive day, but spending a total of six semesters and every waking hour therein making an intricate routine down to the minute I need to take out floss from the cupboard before going for a putting on my shoes for a run at 5:37 P.M.\n\n... And then doing nothing. Losing friendships, self-interest, and failing to take more than rudimentary care of myself.\n\nJesus. I spent six months of quarantine doing the exact same thing: trying to piece my life together and as I do, unravelling the comical fuck-ups that scare me away until I'm ready to try again. School comes along and I'm doing the exact same thing again.\n\nLeaving the house and getting an evaluation appointment this week... whoa there buddy. That's too much progress for the next three months. Maybe there is *nothing* wrong with you. Now spend your time till December trying to make it through your seventh semester of overplanning and exhaustion - fix yourself before the new year with a new, shiny organizational system!\n\nI guess sometimes, if not almost always, feeling like a ghost - one that fades into the background of internal and external monotony - is far more comforting than the energy that of which accompanies being a functional human being."

Unfortunately my luck hasn't fared well from what I've tried on computer. I don't have access to a phone (and therefore, shazaam) - hence cannot use that or any similar programmes. \n\n100% findable on YouTube.

Perhaps because satisfying the need would require help/socializing/taking yourself or life or someone else seriously... all kinds of things you hardly can do if you forgot who you are because you were never taken seriously.   \n\nI believe neglect by parents can happen conscious but also unconscious, which is why sometimes it might seem like your parents did fine when in fact they perhaps never truly asked you **what do you want, what do you feel, how are you, can I help you...**, perhaps because you seemed ok from the outside.  \n\nAnd also, in this society it's kinda standard to suppress a big part of yourself, the more your authentic self deviates from what is considered norm, the more you need to learn to suppress. **The key is to find out what you really are like, what things really make you feel smth and not what things *should* make you feel smth as if there was a right and wrong.**",

What helped me was shifting the focus away from the fact that I am trapped here unless I kms, but instead I tried to remember what I liked as a kid. Because it is not possible to never have felt smth nice in your entire life. For me it is painting and sculpting and being in the nature and observing things all by myself. Now, it took me a full year to even regain some joy and the ability to focus on the art and nature without my brain shifting to the negative thoughts that include our society. But now that I mastered this I can not stop doing it and I love it. I also discovered that there is a very small percentage of the world that embraces these things in a similar way like me and a lot of these people are loners and introverts too but don't seem that way online because you rather see their products and very little of the actual person behind it.    \n\nMaybe you have a childhood memory where you felt satisfied, fulfilled, content, excited, euphoric... And you can try to recreate these situations and feelings by doing similar stuff. Forget society, focus on this.",

As long as multiple people exist, there will always be different opinions, and it is sadly impossible to fully be aware of everyones worldview. I do not think they disqualify the gender of the person. Yes there seems to be a lack of understanding what it means to be attracted to only same sex, but after all, it is a lack of insight and not a phobia. It is a weird time where minorities fight because they all are hurt. We need to learn to be able to discuss things without cathegorizing eachother as enemies if opinions do not always overlap and instead focus on making eachother understand our perception of reality, while trying to understand the other one too. Only then we will meet as humans. I think a big part of each community is decent people, and as we all know, decent people don't fight so they are invisible online.  \n\nLove & Peace",

So why not sharing it.)  \n\nFrom Wikipedia  \n\nCleckley then considers whether psychopathy may be erratic genius. In surveying some noted literary works embodying what he describes as \"malignantly perverse attitudes\", such as by Paul Verlaine, Dostoevski, Marquis de Sade, Baudelaire and Swinburne (some associated with the Decadent movement), he suggests that it might be a form of psychopathy, and might appeal to similarly disordered people or to \"new cults of intellectual defeatists and deviates\" such as certain avant garde groups. **However he concludes that such artworks and sexual deviations are more likely due to schizoid disorder with misanthropy and life perversion**, whereas the \"true psychopath\" would not labor to produce art extolling pathologic or perverse attitudes; on the contrary, they would tend to superficially proclaim belief in a normal, moral life. However, Cleckley then suggests that initial potential for greatness and emotional depth may cause problems, such as being more affected by problems in life, that then leads into psychopathy."

Only after I started exploring Exalted Plains did the hair meshes start randomly pixelating and then disappearing completely. This now happens outside of the Plains as well. It isn't about the hair mods as it happened with multiple different mods, vanilla and modded companion hairs, and vanilla Inquisitor hairs.\n\nI've tried trimming the mods I use. I don't have any hair texture mods. The only thing I can think of is the Enhanced Character Creation but it can't apparently be removed mid-playthrough. I also have the mesh visibility fixes, some complexion, eye and eyelash mods, and texture replacers for armors.\n\nI use Frosty, I was using DAIMM but after this started I removed all the mods from it and stopped using it. Repairing the game did nothing. Mods list is included in the Imgur link."

                "body": "Having just finished it, I found it remarkably unremarkable and disappointing. Many parts felt missing from the original which created pace and immersion and Hangar 13 completely missed the point of them deliberately. (Source: [https://www.ladbible.com/technology/gaming-the-mafia-remake-rewards-players-rather-than-trying-to-beat-them-20201009](https://www.ladbible.com/technology/gaming-the-mafia-remake-rewards-players-rather-than-trying-to-beat-them-20201009))\n\nA good example are the drives from A to B and then Home after a mission, then back to Salieri in the morning. Yes, they were long, but they weren't tedious and had a purpose which Hangar 13 entirely missed. They gave you a chance to learn the city and admire it, and made an immersive point that you were living in the shoes of Tommy in Lost Haven. The original Mafia gave you the opportunity to do other things outside of the missions rather than a separate Free Play mode and it provided emotional relief from events or a chance to let them sink in rather than go from mission A immediately teleported to mission B on rails. Mafia:DE quickly became disengaging and made me not care about anything that was happening as it became a continuous To-Do List. I wanted to go to Lucas Bertone and do the vehicle missions between my missions, not in a separate Free Play mode for example.\n\nThis also made the gas fillup stations around the town completely useless so I have no idea why they bothered putting them in. Additionally, I kept having to use the minimap because I couldn't remember the city, while I fondly remember in the first game often knowing where I was and how to get to Salieri's fairly easily.\n\nTommy's voice acting wasn't as good as the original. It was too wise-guyish. Lacked the humility of a cab driver throughout his acting delivery.\n\nThe main characters had some depth, but felt rushed and disjointed, almost like they didn't belong together, quite possibly, again, because of jumping from mission to mission while skipping years of story in a flash instead of letting the player pass some time in the city, driving around, doing other things. So the pacing was missed. I couldn't bring myself to care for the characters like I did in the original at all. Also, Sarah, the whole reason Tommy is going to the cops for, is barely there. I miss driving home to her like in the original. She is a very likeable and important character and we barely get more time with her than we do with Vincenzo.\n\nAccording to the article I linked, they changed the game up for some crucial scenes, which imho was for the worst. Instead of the iconic Lucky Bastard mission we get a washed out action-packed cliche cinematic of jumping in front of a train chase that's overly done in movies. And for some reason Vincenzo is there because they tried to integrate \"extra\" characters into the story which is not a good idea. You can't develop a small character enough for us to care about him. He is just the gun guy, and he should stay the gun guy.\n\nOverall, if I played this for the first time instead of having played the original, it would be a completely forgettable experience, while the original Mafia wasn't. Mainly due to pacing, lack of immersion and bad pick for main voice actor which made him unrelatable and unlikeable in his delivery (not many people like wise-guys, even if they have a heart).\n\nNext time, let the player go start the missions in his/her own time.\n\n/rant"

I'll show them to you so you can judge for yourself:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mona Lisa 1](https://imgur.com/a/H6ugZ3F)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mona Lisa 2](https://imgur.com/a/tB8jHDF)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mona Lisa 3](https://imgur.com/a/5jUZMfJ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was examining them for a long time, comparing them to others where she seemed to smile a bit more (like this one, kinda: [Mona Lisa (darker)](https://imgur.com/a/KrnsDv5)) or a lot more, and just trying to get to the bottom of it. Finally, I came to the conclusion that what we mostly perceive as her smile is the shadow over her upper right lip, not really the shape of her mouth as such, and that the darkness and distinctness of the shadow very much changes depending on what reproduction you're looking at. All the reproductions have very different colors, depth and quality, and I suppose most of us can't just go to Louvre right now and check the original (I saw the painting a couple of times as a kid but I just remember being generally underwhelmed).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen an interesting thing happened: the more I was looking at her pictures, the more ambivalent her smile started to appear on pretty much all of them, not just those I originally found. Satisfied with my findings, I started doing something else. After a while, I scanned the Google picture search again to confirm my theory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy eyes almost fell out of my head when I found her smiling AGAIN!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat distinct smirk everyone here has been talking about was firmly BACK, everywhere. I was like, \"What the fuck is going on? Is this a flip flop?\", and suddenly got the feeling that that damn lady is actually watching me, amused by my confusion. I really felt like her eyes were staring at me. The more I looked, the more she smiled. After a while I looked again, and the smile seemed to be smaller again... maybe. Weird stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I've come to the conclusion that there are **two factors at play here**:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) The quality, depth, and darkness of the reproductions considerably **differs** and influences the smile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) **The portrait is literally fucking with us.** I bet this is what made Mona Lisa so famous in the first place - her smile is so changeable and lifelike and eerie, as well as her eyes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease share your opinions on this! I wonder if she also changes right in front of you. Or maybe I've just been seeing things? Who knows."

It's gotten really bad in the last decade (the intrusive thoughts are BRUTAL), but I always thought it was \"only\" anxiety and being neurotic, and only in recent weeks a lightbulb finally came on and now I'm on a waiting list for a clinical psychologist and expect a diagnosis with 100% certainty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, since I was about 11, I've also been experiencing this weird thing from time to time when things I'd been previously obsessing over (mostly favorite books and TV shows) suddenly kind of flipped in my brain and I started focusing on some stupid detail or idea and developed an intrusive thought about it (usually something sexual or gross), and to my utter dismay, the show/book gradually became unwatchable/unreadable. This has only ever happened with things I genuinely loved, so it's always been really distressing when I suddenly started to \"hate\" them in a way, knowing in the back of my mind that it wasn't real, but I wasn't able to fight it, so I was forced to drop them altogether. I could always return to them eventually but the obsession wasn't \"active\" anymore so it felt like I was robbed of something anyway. (Edit to add: I've always thought that it was my fault and experienced huge amounts of shame and guilt in these situations.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut what's even worse, I've experienced something similar with *people* multiple times. I sort of suspect this might also be related to some kind of attachment trauma, but I was really wondering if OCD could play a role. I always really, really love someone, we develop a really intense and close bond, and then it's like a flip is switched (usually when I'm feeling emotionally overwhelmed for whatever reason) and I suddenly develop this irrational animosity toward them. I can't stand them, I can hardly be around them, everything they say annoy me. The only difference is that I'm usually not experiencing intrusive thoughts. As I've matured over time, I've learned to \"weather the storm\" and wait for these negative feelings to pass, but it's not always easily discernible if the person has become genuinely toxic for me or it's is just the usual cycle repeating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was really wondering if anyone else here is familiar with these cycles and if there could be something purely physiological at play here, some kind of chemical imbalance. Could this be a symptom of something much larger? Could this be \"cured\"? Thanks a lot you guys for your feedback in advance."

For example, what class is the best one for beginners? I was thinking about playing a healer, but I'm a bit worried that, since it's not a very damage-heavy class, it would be a bit uphill for me to level up, which could end up being frustrating. Same thing with the learning curve, is it achievable for newbies? Or should I try to find people or friends to play with me to make the journey smoother?\n\nOh, and I'm from Spain! Is there any server you think would be best to join?\n\nAnd, most important of all: show me your memes and inside jokes! I love learning about the community!\n\nThank you so much for answering, I'm very excited to start playing! <3"

Due to the format I cannot add photos, but I'll keep the image descriptions! \n\nHope you enjoy!\n\nOkay so after watching the finale I find myself having a lot of thoughts and feelings about Jake, as per usual.\u00a0\n\nSo, to start with, I do not believe he\u2019s evil, but I DO get the feeling he would be one of the villains (together with Khonshu, who is in some way the big villain in Moon Knight in general) if there is a season 2. In all his\u00a0\u201cappearances\u201d (read: blackouts) and the end credits scene he has been shown as somebody who is cappable of great violence, so I get that for the moment, at first glance, he might seem evil. The thing is, I believe that season 1 has already left some groundwork behind to stablish where Jake comes from a little bit better, a groundwork that would propell his characterisation in future appearances.\n\nI will be talking about Marc and Steven as characters and one very important scene in the asylum and how it shines a new light onto\u00a0who Jake might be, as well as his relationship with Khonshu! (This got long OMG)\n\n\nMARC, STEVEN AND FALSE DUALITY\n\nThe show seems to want to stablish Marc and Steven as complete opposites since the beginning, showing them struggling against each other, their identities clashing with each other (Steven in a pacifist, Marc has violent outburts; Steven is really intelligent and knowledgable, Marc has some amazing fighting prowess; Steven comes out as hopeful, innocent and naive, while Marc seems cynical and strict). This contrast in emphaticed to the viewers by making it seem like they are the only two alters, instantly creating an illusiory duality. As the show goes along we start understanding these characters, why they are how they are, we uncover their hidden depths and follow them in their discovery of themselves and growth as individuals. This way, we see Steven gaining confidence in his knowledge and skills and standing up for himself, to the point of downright antagonizing Khonshu and pressing him to make a deal that would leave Marc and himself out of the god\u2019s grasp. We as the audience see how much Marc has suffered, his distante for killing and guilt over the death of his brother, how the grieves for his mother but yet how cappable he is of love, how much he cares for Layla and Steven, to the point of sacrificing himself for them (making a deal with Khonshu and abandoning the Fields of Reeds). We see him learn to express his feelings and grief and ultimately starting to forgive himself, thanks to Steven\u2019s support.\n\nSo, what about Jake?\n\nThe thing is, by putting the focus of attention in Marc and Steven and therefore manufacturing this false duality (since their differences are not at all that extreme), the show has made us forget that there are not only two alters, there are three. Intellectually, we know that Jake is there, but since we don\u2019t really get to meet him, we never get to figure out his place in the narrative and, most importantly, in the system.\n\nNow, right after watching the after-credits scene, I started thinking, and there was one particular scene that popped to my mind quite quickly.\n\n\nTHE ASYLUM AND MARK'S FEARS\n\nRemember the asylum? I have seem some people theorice that, taking inspiration from the comics (Lemire\u2019s run, spoilers!), the one behind Marc\u2019s vision of a mental hospital might have been Konshu, manipulating him by making him doubt his reality. I personally do not agree with this theory, since the asylum only started appearing once Marc and Steven had been shot. I believe it is what it is stated to be in the show: how the Duat presents itself to feel more \u201ccomfortable\u201d and familiar to Marc and Steven, plain and simple, no trickery to be found. Therefore, since the Duat seems to feed off the dead traveller\u2019s mind, I think that the scenes between both Marc and Steven and Doctor Harrow are simply manifestations of Marc\u2019s mind (since he\u2019s the most exceptic one and also has the most selfhate), putting every single detail into doubt and repeatting over and over again that he must be crazy, that he cannot trust his own senses and experiences, etc (remember, Marc is the one that shows more resistance to accepting himself and his DID, it takes being possessed by Khonshu and Harrow taking advance of the stigma afaints mental illnesses to get him to admit that he needs help). Therefore, I think that Doctor Harrow could be interpreted and his own self-doubts and hatred, throwing againts him(self) the things that he\u2019s the most insecure and afraid of, although they do make him face them head-front (\u201dis this real? you are just denying reality. You have to face your fears- which is actually helfpul-. Maybe that\u2019s why Steven knows inmmediality that it is an illusion, might even explain why Steven doesn\u2019t have a room of his own: \u201cwhen danger is near, Steven Grant has no fear\u201d, he doesn\u2019t grown afraid, he is not fearful of not knowing his own reality or facing a painful reality, he always pushes through). That\u2019s the reason why both Marc and Steven see Harrow\u2019s bloody footsteps, refuse to listen to him and\u00a0\u201cwake up\u201d from the room, Marc has learnt to forgive himself and see his self-hatred for what it is: a deception created to hurt himself, but not a reflection of reality.\n\nTaking this into account, and keeping in mind that according to this theory Doctor Harrow\u2019s words are Marc\u2019s hidden fears, I think this scene is VERY interesting:\n\n(Images in the original post)\n\n(Image description: Episode 5. Marc staring at the water inside a cup and then at Doctor Harrow with a look of slight sadness and fear on his face, Doctor Harrow saying\u00a0\u201cdo you think you created Steven to hide from all the awful things you feel you\u2019ve done in your life, or do you think Steven created Marc to punish the world for what your mother did to you?\u201d)\u00a0\n\nI think that the answer to this question is neither, and both at the same time, just that it doesn\u2019t apply to Steven, but to Jake.\n\nMarc is perfectly aware of who Steven is and what he means to him, he has said to multiple times. He wants to see Steven life a happy, normal life, he loves his hope and how he was always there for him, he wants to protect him and hide him from hurt. He doesn\u2019t fit at all the topic of the question.\n\nBut, and Jake? Where does Jake come from? And how does Harrow\u2019s question apply to him?\n\nLet's look at the evidence.\n\n\nWHO IS JAKE\n\nWhat have we seen Jake do over and over again? When has he appeared? When Steven and Marc are in extreme danger, and probably about to die (when Harrow\u2019s thugs attacked Steven, the car chase, when Marc faced off against those guys at Cairo, when Harrow was siphoning Khonshu\u2019s power). I believe that Jake, as a lot of people have said, is a protector alter, which, according to did-research.org (which I hope is a good source, please correct me if I use missinformation!) are \u201calters that protect the body, system, host, core, or other specific alters or groups of alters. Physical protectors might take or try to prevent physical abuse or become aggressive in an attempt to defend against physical abuse\u201d. I believe that every single time Jake has appeared, he has been both preventing either Steven or Marc from dying and actually going one step further and trying to put them out of harm\u2019s way (taking the cab back to the airport in Cairo, leaving the military during Marc\u2019s fugue state and generally killing every one that might be a danger). He\u2019s trying to protect the other alters, not just being mindlessly violent.\u00a0\n\nNow, the speculation (and actual link to the question, yay!) starts.\u00a0\n\nMarc absolutely hates killing. While it hasn\u2019t been said outright, he mourns over a room full of his targets saying that he remembers every single one of their faces. He says that, after one point, he wished that one of them might finally kill him instead. He also hates seeing people die, he\u2019s driven to the point of desperation during his time as a mercenary, reaching a peak when he\u2019s unable to protect Layla\u2019s father and the rest of his team from dying. During the finale, we see him choosing to preserve a life, even if it is Harrrow\u2019s, rather than take it.\u00a0\n\n\u201cdo you think you created (Steven) JAKE to hide from all the awful things you feel you\u2019ve done in your life?\u201d \n\nYes! Jake is the one who, when worst comes to worst and the only way out is to eliminate, to erradicate the danger, takes over and starts shooting. He is the shield between Marc and all the bodies he has had to leave behind, eventually shouldering the responsability to get blood on his hands and therefore sparing Marc and Steven from having to take a life.\u00a0\n\nBut also, what other fear did Marc\u2019s subconscious, in the form of Doctor Harrow, throw at him? What other part of his being was he refusing to face?\n\n\u201cor do you think (Steven)\u00a0YOU created (Marc) JAKE to punish the world for what your mother did to you?\u201d  \n\nAnd here it is, the dark reality that Marc is hiding, probably the reason why he (together with Steven) he refuses to investigate who is the one fronting and killing their enemies during their blackouts. The reason why Jake is so vicious. The reason why, after the finale, Jake is still working with Khonshu.\u00a0\n\nWho is Khonshu? In the comics (and, according to Wikipedia, the real Khonsu) he\u2019s the God of the Moon, with epipeths as\u00a0 \"Embracer,\" \"Pathfinder,\" and \"Defender\", he\u2019s the god of those who travel at night, their protector. In the show, while his nature as god of the moon and night sky is more than proven, there is a huge emphasis of another of his aspects: that of vengeance, played as opposite of Ammit and her preventive condemn. Khonshu, through his Fist, punishes those that have done wrong (specifically against travellers of the night).\u00a0\n\n(Images in the original post)\n\n(Image description: Episode 6. Marc hesitates before striking the final blow on Harrow, meanwhile Khonsu says\u00a0\u201cthe choice is vengeance\u201d) \n\nJake is a traveller and a pathfinder through his job as a cab (limo now) driver, he is Marc and Steven\u2019s Protector by taking the need to spill blood upon himself, but Jake is also the person who  punishes the world for what your Marc\u2019s mother did to you him\u201d\u00a0Jake is Marc\u2019s Vengeance.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why he keeps working with Khonshu, that\u2019s why, while both Marc and Steven have managed to grow past their roles and go on with their life, Jake is still keeping the deal with Khonshu. He hasn\u2019t appeared on the show, he hasn\u2019t experienced the same character development as the other two alters, he\u2019s still stuck is his initial, bloody role as protector and avenger.\n\n\nWHAT JAKE'S FUTURE MIGHT BE\n\nTaking all of this into account, I believe that in future works Jake is going to go through the same journey that both Steven and Marc have experienced this season. He is going to face the place where he comes from, how he perceives himself and his role, he\u2019s going to grow into his individuality and needs. I personally think that one of the themes of this finale is going to be crucial, a theme that Layla, Marc, Steven and Khonshu fight for: choice. The hability to choose for yourself who you want to be, what you want to do, the hability to be your own master, freedom. I think that, taking into account that right now he is still under Khonshu\u2019s comand, Jake\u2019s right to chose for himself and his freedom are going to play a huge role in his character arc.\n\nObviously, at the beginning he is going to be an antagonistic figure, but I think that after reading this meta it can be said that Jake is not, by himself, a bad person. He just wants to protect Marc and Steven, to fight for them. He\u2019s the one who is willing to get the work done when it\u2019s too much even for Marc, he\u2019s the one who retaliates after the evils inflicted on the other two alters and the travellers, their avengers. I think his arc would consist on learning to trust Marc and Steven and their strength, as well as losing the vicciousness and desensibilitation to violence that so many years of putting himself on the front line have made him grow used to. And I, for one, cannot wait to see him do it.\n\n\nThat's it, thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed it! And sorry if there are any mistakes, English is not my first language!"

I tried it when I first heard of it in early high school and it was cool to do it at first. They can be fun and also helpful when you start getting a nightmare but for the most part I felt like it was just too much effort. I would realise I was dreaming and then just be like ok\u2026 now what? One of the things I love about dreams is how I don\u2019t have to do anything; my subconscious will provide interesting ideas for me and I can just go along for the ride and rest. \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t really get why you\u2019d want to lucid dream when you could just daydream in waking life lol. I\u2019d thought of making a post here asking if anyone else felt the same way. But this morning I had the most rich lucid dream and I finally get it now. I get a lot of interesting/weird/funny dreams but never before have I had one that was just so rich in the senses. It felt so real even though I was fully aware that it wasn\u2019t. I was literally going around touching people\u2019s faces and patting dogs in awe of how I could really feel the skin and the fur even though I knew I wasn\u2019t really doing it. I normally don\u2019t remember/notice people\u2019s faces in dreams as I\u2019m just not paying attention to that but this time there was a fully formed detailed face and I was just like WOW that\u2019s a face. It was a nice balance because it wasn\u2019t like I had to decide how the dream would go. I was still put in situations and going along for a ride but I had awareness and my senses and could somewhat control. \n\nAnyway, idk if anyone felt the same way I did. Maybe they wouldn\u2019t be here if they did haha but I love dreams so much I still wanted to be in a sub about it"

So I want at least 100 people to cry while reading my work. I want at least 3 teardrops per person. (More is fine). If only 1 or 2 teardrops fall, it doesn\u2019t count. I want full-blown sobs here. A nervous breakdown? Even better. \n\nBut how am I supposed to verify if my readers are crying? I could post it online but the hit counter only shows number of hits, not number of tears. They could read it and not cry. Should I install some kind of spyware on the site to record them as they read? Surely there\u2019s some kind of crying detector out there. But how can I know if they\u2019re crying from my work? They could just happen to already be crying as they stumble upon my story. I, for one, always like to read while already crying.\n\nOr maybe I should just send my work out to everyone I know and ask if they cried?\n\nAny advice is appreciated and if anyone could direct me to a good crying detector spyware (preferably free), please let me know!\n\nAnd please also let me know if you cried while reading this post! That would help my numbers substantially."

Anything she or a survivor interact with while being recorded will be saved. She can then choose to replay the recording either normally or in reverse. \n\nLet's say you are being recorded as a survivor and throw down a pallet, Clerk can then use the recording to either pulldown another pallet or pull back up a pallet (this includes cipher and exit gate progress, not sure about healing yet). After a survivor is recorded, the thing they were interacting with gets blocked. Recordings of herself are a bit more restricted, but also powerful. A recording of herself swinging her weapon deals chip damage (like bonbon and sculptor). She can also record herself breaking pallets or using abnormal and that works as you think it would. On the topic of Sculptor, she has a similar thing to Sculptor's chisel and can spectate an area far away and move around while doing so.\n\nShe can save 3 separate recordings. If she recorded a survivor, then she will have 2 of those recordings. Meanwhile if she records herself, she will only have 1 of those recordings. Basically, to simplify it, if she records 3 different survivors doing different actions, she will have 6 recordings to work with, 2 for each survivor; meanwhile if she records herself 3 times, she will only have 3 recordings go work with. She can choose to delete recordings. She can also make it so interactions from the recording are instant (the recordings record everything, including walking, at max presence she can choose to remove that walking). If nothing is interacted with, then the recording is not saved\n\nHopefully this is helpful, if not then I am sorry. [This video](https://youtu.be/Fs-wJc1lFTg) and many others from the test server can help visualize her skills better than I can explain them."

                "body": "Hello, fellow r/IdentityV members, today I would like to talk about the things that make every survivor in the game be broken, BS or outrageous. Please try and keep this discussion civilized as I would like to hear your guys' thoughts on some of the survivors as well. This post will not contain everything that a survivor is capable of. I did one on the hunters already.\n\n**Lucky Guy**-His buff last season made him so, so much better. If he doesn't get his wish granted, his next wish is guaranteed. He is also capable of holding 2 items at once. Lucky Guy can effectively finish a cipher while also safely going for a rescue. Mech can do that too, but she doesn't have the safety of a flare gun by her side, plus she has a vaulting debuff.\n\n**Doctor**-She ignores all healing debuffs applied to her, allowing her to quickly heal herself very quickly while being chased/agroed. While her support levels are still not the best, her kiting potential is extremely high.\n\n**Gardener**-Her bubble isn't really bs or broken, however her toolbox can be. On certain maps like Leo's memory, breaking the chairs near factory and dying upstairs can buy your team a huge amount of time, in some cases you can even struggle free due to the time saved. If the hunter does chair you or a teammate, however, there will be a 10% takeoff slowdown, allowing for cipher rush regardless. If a Gardener had tide turner still by the end game, they can safely rescue and turn a tie into a win.\n\n**Lawyer**-Wall hacks and can't get terrorshocked, nothing much to say besides that.\n\n**Thief**-Just like all the original survivors, Thief isn't the best character. However, this is a discussion about bs, so we have to talk about it. Thief can effectively pull off a long kite by just holding his flashlight towards the hunter. Hunters who don't have some ability that lets them moonwalk much like thief suffer greatly against him.\n\n**Magician**-His wands aren't OP, but the fact that he is invisible for a few seconds after being rescued makes it so he can lose you easily if he plays his cards right, and it really is frustrating losing the person who was chaired at 2 ciphers left.\n\n**Explorer**-His hiding is a pain in the neck, but not broken or OP, what is quite bs about him though is the fact that he can pop an unprimed cipher very quickly. When they nerfed him way back, I always thought they nerfed the wrong part about him, and I still do.\n\n**Mercenary**-He can tank multiple hits and can even tank a detention hit. Nothing else needs to be said here.\n\n**Coordinator**-Nothing about her is bs, unless the person playing as her is smart. If she saves the flare gun for late game, she can turn a tie into a win simply by flare gunning the hunter when they teleport to her. Some hunters use excitement against her, and if she saves her flare gun and they have trump card, they need to make a decision that is against their favor either way.\n\n**Mechanic**-With the removal of the 3% decoding buff to others and nerf of decoding speed to her bot, Mech will not be banned as often. However, she still can decode while downed and on the ground, allowing for cipher pops and primes, meaning chasing her is still a waste of time.\n\n**Forward**-Best harasser in the game and his kiting is very great as well. He can stun the hunter way longer than he stuns himself and if he's kiting, he has a lot of distance he can gain even with 50% football left.\n\n**The Mind's Eye**-Can reveal your location and slow down your actions. Her decoding speed is wack, but with her being physically weak it pays put. Although, she has infinite wall hacks, so that remains.\n\n**Priestess**-Oh boy, will I have a field day with this. She has 2 portals at the start of the match, her portals can stun for quite a long time if you consider the fast pace nature of the game, she gives everyone a 10% reduced healing time and her healing time is reduced by 30%, she can create long portals that teleport survivors across the map AND FINALLY, her portals have no range limit as well as being able to teleport between different levels (like going into the basement). Overall, a roach of a character that needs a hard nerf.\n\n**Perfumer**-Perfume at the edge of a floor and give herself free distance regardless of what the hunter does. The only hunter capable of countering this bring Photographer. Wu Chang can also counter this, but it takes him far longer to do so.\n\n**Cowboy**-His harassing potential can be argued at being either the best or the worst in the game depending on where he is, where the nearest rocket chair is and where his teammate is. On top of all this, if he is holding onto a female survivor, he effectively is an infinite shield for them.\n\n**Female Dancer**-She can decode ciphers at almost TME speed while also being able to really slow down the hunter. Sure, her boxes can be destroyed, but she has 3 of them that she can infinitely reuse.\n\n**Seer**-Grants his teammates a shield for 15 seconds and can give that shield from across the map. He can also give himself a shield while moving, Gardener needs to stand still for 2 seconds to get a 5 second shield, kinda bs isn't it? Also, all he gets is a vaulting debuff from this.\n\n**Embalmer**-Teleport himself or teammates across the map to deny the hunter an easy kill. During the late game, he can literally turn a lose into a tie or a tie into a win due to his coffin. Furthermore, he is immune to being damaged for sometime after exiting his coffin.\n\n**Prospector**-Prospector is a hard case to point out. He's more annoying than broken or bs. I guess you could say that his harassing can be strong.\n\n**Enchantress**-With her recent buff, her kiting has become even more braindead. To top it off, hunters get punished for hitting her or a teammate that healed her/she healed. It's just absolutely bs that she is able to pull the stuff she can despite being a \"nich\u00e9\" survivor.\n\n**Wildling**-Trying to chase a Wildling is a death sentence, even if you counter him. To top it off, you sometimes can't punish him when he gets close while he harasses a hunter.\n\n**Acrobat**-He has a ball that can stop the hunter from using their ability. That's it, that alone makes a lot of hunters become hell ember without presence. Also, in certain areas on certain maps, he can jump over a railing or something along those lines and extend his kite by a long shot. One time on moonlit, I was riding the coaster to the other gate and managed to turn a tie into a win simply because I could jump over the railing at the end.\n\n**First Officer**-Braindead kiting ability that for some reason got a buff a few seasons ago to where if he's hit while using his watch, he can keep going for another 5 seconds. FO is literally if you combined Merc's damage delay and Enchantress' braindead kite together. It's very bs.\n\n**Barmaid**-Barmaid is a high risk, high reward character. Despite her many counters, the one thing she is good at is healing others without anyone having to hold still for longer than 1 second. She can heal the rescuer and decode at the same time. While this isn't broken, it certainly is quite wack.\n\n**Postman**-He has the ability to let others decode faster, recuse faster, open the gate faster and kite longer. It is really crazy to think that Merc can temporarily only have a 5% decoding debuff or Prisoner having 2 broken windows usages in 10 seconds.\n\n**Gravekeeper**-He's the only rescuer who can tank a hit without also losing health. While he does only get 2 shovels, they can be useful in helping him kite or like I said, tank a hit. Gravekeeper is arguably the most balanced rescuer, however he still has some bs sides to him including being able to just go straight into the basement almost the same way priestess can.\n\n**Prisoner**-He can pop a cipher that no one is even on, with this he can pop the rescuer's cipher while they go rescue. Just like Mech, he can basically decode in 2 places at once. He is also the only decoder who has built in self defense and harassing potential. Although in the end game, he is basically more useless than a Mech. Mech can get another item, Prisoner can't get another shock. Also, he can basically open both gates at once, which is just really strange for a decoder to be able to do.\n\n**Entomologist**-Bees can slowdown the hunter and push them, bees also make her move faster. She can apply gel onto windows and pallets to make any survivor who vaults it vault 10% faster. Isn't it a little unfair that the decoder you're chasing suddenly vaults 10% faster and can keep kiting? And that's just the decoders, imagine trying to chase Merc through that!\n\n**Painter**-Paintings can offer a free escape through the exit gate simply because the painting is allowed near it, which is just broken. On top of that, he has no halfway point while being chaired, meaning it would literally be against a hunter's interest to leave his chair, making camping basically a must.\n\n**Batter**-He's Forward, but doesn't have to get too close and risk a hit. He can keep using his cricket balls until the hunter destroys them or he destroys them. Not only that, but his rampage mode makes him the fastest vaulting survivor in the game. His rampage mode also removes his cooldown, so he could literally correct his mistake of missing a ball hit.\n\n**Toy Merchant**-Priestess if she could fly. Although she isn't that strong in high tiere, she literally is basically priestess: if you don't destroy her catapult like with the portals, you are asking for the survivors to continue kiting you. To top it off, I once went against a toy merchant who spawned with a pocket watch. Why on earth is she spawning with a braindead kiting item?\n\n**Patient**-Acrobat, except he can go further distances. Patient also can pull himself up areas and walls. You know that one god window in sacred heart near front gate? He can pull himself through that.\n\n**Psychologist**-Her self-heal bubble makes her a bad target to chase. First of all, she gets 3 health states. If you down her too quickly, she will basically be back to full health when she is standing again without TT active. If you wait for the self-heal to end, you're allowing her the ability to kite long enough for ciphers to pop. To top this off, she can heal a survivor from across the map and the only thing that happens is that she loses a health state, and if she isn't first kite then she has her self-heal bubble to make that fact meaningless.\n\n**Novelist**-He can literally control the hunter's movement. In some cases, he can move them in the way of the tram or into a pallet so the hunter gets pallet stunned.\n\n**Little Girl**-She literally can teleport to any other survivor and all that happens is the hunter sees the location she's at while she's teleporting. When she syncs with another survivor, she makes their kiting stronger and their decoding faster. Her pages can extend her own or someone else's kite for a longer period of time. To top it off, of she syncs onto someone like Merc (after 20 seconds of being unchaired) while she's dead on chair, she is completely immune to taking damage whatsoever, and this is literally stronger than a survivor trying to bodyblock for her while the cipher is being primed. I'm glad they at least nerfed her otherwise she would have literally been banned more than seer and priestess.\n\nNow then, I know a lot of what I said feels repetitive, but keep in mind that there's literally almost 4 pages worth of survivors in the game now."

Please note that a hunter being boring to face does not make them broken. Please try and keep this discussion civilized as I would like to hear your guys' thoughts on some of the hunters as well. This post will not contain everything that a hunter is capable of.\n\n**Hell Ember**-There isn't much going on with this character, despite some of the few neat tricks you can do with him. The main thing with him is that trying to rescue against him is a nightmare, even if you play your cards right and keep baiting out the phantom; sometimes even experienced mercenary players struggle against him.\n\n**Smiley Face**-Despite his current extremely weak state and desperate need of a buff, he still has 1 thing in his kit that just is quite.. unfun to go against. His healing part makes you take 70% longer to heal yourself or get healed. While doc and psychologist can counter this, both of them still have the issue of stopping cipher rush to heal others, and doc especially will take awhile even with max healing points.\n\n**Ripper**-Ripper, as we know, gets cipher rushed easily, however we all have been there where it felt almost impossible to kite them at a weak pallet because of his invisibility. While yes, his foggy blade is another thing, it can be countered more easily than his invisibility (I am aware that hin being stunned or literally doing any action takes him out of invisibility, I am just showing what happens when he isn't forced out of it).\n\n**Gamekeeper**-Not that strong just like the rest above, but if you have played Dead By Daylight than you know where I am going with this. Gamekeeper can place down traps as well as pull you towards him. Much like Ripper, these things can be countered, but what can you possibly do against him out in the open right after being rescued? Nothing much without getting a bodyblock.\n\n**Soul Weaver**-SW is an interesting one. She can't aim her web and she uses up a ton of energy quickly, yet she also can make trying to kite some areas feel like not being Enchantress at 3 stacks means you're dead. A good SW is deadly, but so is literally any hunter. While her cocoon isn't really OP, it does deny harassers the ability to do much.\n\n**Geisha**-Nothing much to say about her, I mean we all know her hitbox is hot garbage, but literally being able to dash towards someone's location is a bit wacky.\n\n**Feaster**-Trying to rescue against a full pressence Feaster is basically just like trying to rescue against a Hell Ember. The difference being that you get a small window to try and save, but still difficult nonetheless. Him being able to track your location isn't BS, for those of you who *are typing that while reading this.*\n\n**Wu Chang**-Black form's attack recovery speed and White form's hitbox both are the main things that make Wu Chang feel like unfair mess already. However, the main thing comes from when he gains pressence. Black form can hit you and then bell you to deny you the ability to get away, White form can literally zoom towards you quickly and then hit you while also denying you the ability to do anything but use your abilities. Isn't it a little unfair that he can stop you from being able to rescue and be able to down you before soul siphon is even up?\n\n**Photographer**-There's nothing really bs about him, he is very counterable. The main issue with him is that he is an absolute snooze fest, and no one likes being bored while playing.\n\n**Mad Eyes**-Very counterable just like Photographer, but his camping can arguably be stronger than Sculptor's. He can block off your ability to even touch the chair while at the same time constantly be pressuring ciphers. He's been nerfed enough times, but this discussion is about what makes a hunter bs or boring, so got to include it.\n\n**Dream Witch**-Hit you with the leech away from the chair and then be immediately able to switch to the leech camping the chair. Despite her nerf, she is still a very powerful hunter. She's also still the only hunter who can carry a survivor to a chaid and pressure a cipher from across the map.\n\n**Axe Boy**-If he misses the fireball circling around you, he gets a rewarded with a speed boost. At max pressence, leaving the area of his trees slows you down. Don't you think it's a little wack that you get punished and he gets rewarded for mistakes?\n\n**Evil Reptilian**-The recovery from body slamming someone to being able to basic attack is not that long, sometimes it's difficult for one of the Veteran survivors to be able to rescue from the fast recovery.\n\n**Bloody Queen**-Ah yes, the infamous BQ, able to hit someone basically from across the map and almost impossible to dodge the mirror while up close. Bit wack that she basically can walk through walls and hit you, but a really unfun part about her is just her ability to deny you the ability to escape after she hits you.\n\n**Bonbon**-Basically a braindead camp, even mercs with a Seer owl can struggle. It was even worse before they nerfed bonbon.\n\n**Ann**-Even if she messes up the timing of her cats while camping, she can still be rewarded by making it so the person who was rescued doesn't even have a chance to escape. Also, if she messed up her cats, she can just explode them to have them back quicker.\n\n**Violinist**-I'd argue that there's hardly anything bad about him, considering the fact that he takes so much skill to use anyways with a mediocre reward. Nevertheless, I'd say that him having basically no cooldown on his first ability (apart from trying to place the 2nd note too far away) is really cracked.\n\n**Sculptor**-Strong chase, strong camp and strong map pressure makes her be the current queen of the hunter tier list. Her statues of nobility just being a homing missile is also rather a pain to deal with.\n\n**Undead**-He's not OP, but his whole gimmick of being slug only is more boring to face than going against a Photographer (in my opinion). First off, he has infinite excitement; secondly is that rescuers are bored out of their mind because there isn't tue intensity of trying to rescue someone, it is literally just healing them off the ground.\n\n**Breaking Wheel**-The thanos snap, nothing more to say. It just makes learning how to use wheel form correctly not be as rewarding because you can just cheaply hit a survivor in wheel form and then press a button to injure/down them from a medium distance with no brain power needed.\n\n**Naiad**-Now, I am a Naiad main, so I can better understand the garbage I can pull with her. First off, she can shutdown an entire corner of a map's looping area; this ability also makes her basement camp insanely strong, i've turned the basement into an aquarium and gotten a double down even if the person rescuing goes for save almost instantly. Secondly, she can dash onto you and then immediately stop her dash. I was greatly saddened that they implemented that because it made her a less skill based hunter and more of a \"here, you won't be punished for messing up\" hunter.\n\n**Wax Artist**-His regular wax can freeze you in place and prevent you from being able to get far, this ability also counters some weaker survivors like Gardener (she can't get her bubble because the wax resets the progress). His hit wax is arguably even more ridiculous than trying to kite max presence bonbon. He can put hot wax on you with it nearly at around 90%, basic attack you and then you just go down 2 seconds later. Another thing, he can shoot wax and almost immediately can basic attack when he stops shooting wax.\n\n**Nightmare**-Free peepers, teleport and quenching effect in 1 kit. While yes, his teleport has a big cooldown, remember that he can probably guard 2 locations at once better than a DW or Photographer can. His 1st ability also autolocks on survivors, while it isn't OP it does make juking him impossible. A patient Nightmare can deal with loops that semi-counter him pretty well."

                "body": "*Disclaimer: This theory is entirely my opinionated theory/hypothesis and is in no way factual or should be treated as such. It is highly recommended to do your own research to come up with your own conclusion.*\n\nHello everyone, as many of us are aware, we all have some form of interest that we might have a high spark or even hyper fixation for, more commonly known as a \"Special Interest\". For those of you unaware, Special Interests are, as stated above, an interest a person holds that they are very knowledgeable about. Autistic people usually are the ones falling into this category because when we find something we find interesting, we want to know more about it. A simple example of a Special Interest is one on birds, in which you would know about a bird's life cycle and different types of birds. Special Interests can be more specific, such as Owls. Special interests can last from a couple of hours, days, months or even years.\n\nNow that we have the definition out of the way, let's get onto my theory. My theory is that every Autistic individual has a conscious (active) and subconscious (passive) Special Interest. What do I mean by that? Let's use an example: Alex's Active Special Interest is trains, their Passive is animal psychology. Their Active Special Interest came from learning about the first trains in school, their Passive seemed to have come out of no where. It might be confusing to explain/understand, but basically what i'm trying to say is that Active Special Interests come from literally finding something interesting that they saw/heard and wanting to learn more about it. Passive Special Interest, however, seem to come from seemingly no where, almost as if you were born with them.\n\nActive Special Interests allow you to do some amazing things such as fact checking a certain topic, being good at a sport, game or specific character in a game and so on. Actives also can be used for job opportunities, programming is an example. Passive Special Interests are Special Interests that more of shape you into who you are as a person. If we go back to the example about Alex, their Passive was animal psychology. This allows Alex to have an understanding of how animals behave without really ever putting much research into it. With that, Alex could understand when their or someone else's life is in danger or how an animal feels about a situation. Humans are animals as well, so this Passive Special Interest can roughly also translate to human behavior as well, allowing Alex to be able to read people better despite lacking social skills.\n\nWith that, we can come to the conclusion that despite my terrible essay formatting, we understand that my theory talks about Active and Passive Special Interests. Active being that which you currently hold a hyperfixation for, Passive being something you seem to be naturally good at doing even though you barely put research into it.\n\nThank you for taking your time to read this. And for those wondering, my passive are philosophy and human psychology."

                "body": "Firstly, in the background story video, there are several noticeable things: the hunter's name is Grace, she washer up from a river, the locals saw her ad a gift from the heavens, she asks why fish can't talk and lastly we see that when she is sunk to the bottom of the ocean, her hands grow fin like features.\n\nSecondly, Naiads are creatures from Greek mythology and they are female spirits that inhabit rivers, springs and waterfalls. In rituals, their waters were credited with magical medical properties. Animals were also drowned for this ritual. The Greek meaning of the name \"Grace\" refers to the \"pleasing\" or \"charming\" appearance of fertile field or garden.\n\nAlright, now that we have the important details added, let's get to the topic at hand. Grace, as already stated, can be seen that the locals attempted to drown her in the video, but she obviously became more fish like and survived. She also mentions fish a lot. In her poster, we can see that she is holding a harpoon as well as a boat being behind her.\n\nMy theory is that she might have something to do with the Lakeside village. For her attacks, I suspect that for a regular attack she will swing the harpoon just like Wu Chang White form's charged attack; for her charged attack, I suspect it might be similar to Wu Chang Black form's charged attack. For her abilities, I suspect that she use water as a wip. She will also probably give you some kind of debuff by throwing fish at her. Her max presence might be just the wip being able to reach further. She might even have the ability to throw her harpoon at survivors.\n\nFor her S tier skin, I read a youtube comment saying that she might look like Aphrodite. My theory is that her S tier skin will be a mix between Aphrodite and Poseidon. If not, [this](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Naiad) could also work as well.\n\nCitation: https://youtu.be/uRz7O6e3bc0 https://youtu.be/Ng6AiT8Lb8Q https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naiad https://www.britannica.com/topic/Grace-Greek-mythology"

They sponsored my Visa, and the contract is beyond the minimum \u201csalary\u201d required for a working visa. I got a 5 year Visa for my position (although since the company is a very large respected Japanese company, that may have had some sway on the period of my Visa.)\n\nThis contract only requires me to work 3 days a week, so in addition, I do freelance graphic design, illustration, and translation outside of my contract, since that work also falls within my visa category. In addition, I get special permissions to do entertainment work, since entertainment work falls into a different Visa category. \n\nThe main annoyance as a freelancer is that you will need to do your own taxes and sign up/pay for National health insurance/pension.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely doable though.",

Not many types at available, and adapted machines go for over double (sometimes triple) the USD cost here- it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. If I want to spend $2,500 for a machine, I want it to be worth that price, not a machine that would run $1,200 in the US.\n\nI\u2019ve thought about getting a U.S. machine that runs at 110v and just making do, but I\u2019ve discovered that the price of the 230v European machines are actually the best deal to import. \n\nAs someone who knows little/nothing about electrical stuff, will using a quality transformer (converting 100 to 230v) mean that the machine will run absolutely the same as it would in the country of origin? Or would I still be somehow compromising the quality of the machine?\n\nThank you!"

Yes, I know this was stupid. \n\nLast year, I paid all my pension/taxes/insurance up front to avoid this issue, and I plan to do the same this year (and all the years going forward.) My next Visa renewal is in January 2024. I have two questions.\n\n1)  If I've been timely for 20 months at the time of renewal, will my late payments still affect my visa renewal? I've never used a lawyer for visa renewal stuff, but should I next year just to be safe?\n\n2) I see that I need to provide tax/insurance/pension documentation for 5 years to apply for permanent residency. Do I need to wait until I have 5 years of timely payments? Or can I get away with less (ie- two years)\n\nIf anybody has any insight, I'd be very grateful!"

I drink pretty much exclusively lattes (I like strong coffee with a lot of milk), and so while the quality of the latte's was so/so, I still enjoyed the lattes I made much more than regular drip coffee with cream. However, it's time for an upgrade. I want to be able to experiment and turn this into a hobby.\n\nAfter doing quite a bit of research, I thought to get the Gaggia Classic Pro and mod it out with the OPV, PID, IMS basket, slim drip tray for scales, pressure gauge, and bottomless filter. I am realizing, however, that with all the mods, my total will come to around $800 USD. I've seen people claim that with all the mods, the Gaggia Classic Pro is comparable to machines many times it's price, but is this true?\n\nShould I get a Gaggia Classic Pro  Or should I buy a more expensive machine that doesn't need mods?  If so, do you have any recommendations? My budget is around $1,000 (machine + any mods), and I don't want to go too far beyond that. \n\nOh, and I have a 1zspresso K-Plus grinder. Maybe someday I'll invest in an electric grinder, but from what I've gathered, this is a good hand grinder for espresso. Also, I will mostly just be making espresso for myself. I only have guests on rare occasions."

I\u2019m a latte drinker- I like strong coffee flavor with a lot of milk. So despite the machine being not the greatest, I still preferred using it to a regular coffee machine.\n\nHowever, the time has come for me to upgrade! I\u2019ve decided I want to invest in my new hobby, and ordered a Gaggia Classic Pro with plans to mod it right away. I live in Japan, however, so the machine and mods won\u2019t arrive for another month or so.\n\nIn the meantime, I got a good deal on a 1zspresso K Plus hand grinder which just arrived today. This is my first time grinding my own coffee.\n\nI know that my Delongi lacks in pressure.  The K Plus manual says to grind between 3 to 4.5 for espresso, so I did midways, around 4. Yikes!\n\nResults were sort of burntish but also sour, and the machine actually started leaking around the portafilter. Puck was also quite wet.\n\nPeople always say \u201cgrind finer,\u201d but with a machine like this, should I be going with a coarser grind? Should I adjust the dosing first? Am I tamping to hard?\n\nI\u2019d like to have at least halfway decent coffee until my new machine arrives!"

My concerns were ADHD and autism. Son was too young to diagnose with ADHD but psych saw \"definite signs\" of attention issues. Interestingly, he said that based on his observation of my son he would not say he has autism, but based on the questionnaires his dad and I filled out, he did see some signs. He told us that the main issue with autism was if it caused the child to not be able to connect with other people, and my son has no problems at all with that. He loves people. He said autism is a spectrum and even if my son is a little bit autistic, what does matter if it isn't affecting him? \n\nSo - I see where he's coming from, but I do see a lot of unusual  behaviors from him, more so than when he was evaluated. I'm not sure if it's just his quirkiness or signs that he is indeed autistic. He's in kindergarten now and doing very well, happy, loves and is loved by his friends. If he's doing ok, should I push another evaluation or stop looking for trouble? I'm not sure how much detail I should say about what I'm seeing in him, but I'm thinking of rapid blinking, repeating the last syllable of a word a few times while he's talking (sounds like I'm saying he's stuttering, but it's different), talking about the same very specific things for months on end, some hand flapping, a lack of awareness of body space (he will hang all over people he just met), poor fine motor skills, and I'm sure there's others but I can't think of any at the moment. If you think I'm overthinking and need to relax, please don't hesitate to say that. There's not a thing about him I would change but if there's any specific interventions he might need I want to be aware. He did have close to a year of OT and made great progress with his motor skills and attention. His OT didn't think his flapping was any issue, she did mention that he's very sensory seeking and actually\"prescribed\" daily roughhousing, which he loves (he's in karate now, which is great for him). Just curious for some outside perspective. Thank you!!!"

He had been having what I now know were absence seizures for a while, but this one was longer and we took him to the ER. So his first EEG was \"very abnormal\" according to his neurologist and she said she was surprised he hadn't had convulsive seizures based on his brain activity. Said his left side was abnormal the whole time with occasional generalized abnormal activity. \n\nSo this follow-up EEG last week, she said he had a lot of epileptic activity in his sleep, and it's starting in the frontal lobe. Basically it's my understanding that it starts focally in the frontal lobe and then goes general and presents as an absence seizure. Google is telling me (yeah, I know, googling is bad) that usually seizures that start this way end up generalizing as tonic-clonic. But absence seizures aren't unheard of and usually indicate brain abnormalities - but my son's MRI was normal last year. \n\nI'm probably WAY overthinking this. We are going to do genetic testing on him to see if there's an underlying reason. Meanwhile I'm just wondering if anything I said makes sense to anyone out there. My son is on keppra and the frequency of his seizures that I've noticed is much lower since he's started. Thank you for any advice you may have!"

Couple notes about terminology:\n\n* 5km race pace = 5:26 min/mile (for me, but insert your 5km race pace here for training)\n* half marathon pace = 5:55 min/mile (for me, but insert your HM race pace here for training)\n* \"recovery\" pace was roughly 7:45-8:30 min/mile\n* \"easy\" pace was roughly 7:00-7:45 min/mile\n* \"moderate\" pace is roughly 6:30-6:55 min/mile\n* Everything is a run unless specified, eg, \"BIKING\"\n\nNote that these numbers are mine. If you are in 20 min 5km shape, put in 6:26 min/mile as your 5k pace, etc.\n\nPrior to this I had been running regularly 10-70 miles a week for about 3 years and so I had an excellent cardio base.\n\n**Week 1:** 6h 51m cardio\n\n* Mon:  Rest\n* Tues: 10.3 miles\n* Wed: 14.2 miles\n* Thu: 11 miles easy\n* Fri: 5.5 miles easy\n* Sat:  Rest\n* Sun: 15.5 miles, trail\n\n**Week 2:** 7h 24m cardio\n\n* Mon: 10.4 miles easy\n* Tues: 8 miles easy\n* Wed: Rest\n* Thu: Rest\n* Fri: 13 miles easy\n* Sat:  13 miles moderate\n* Sun: 17.1 miles easy\n\n**Week 3:** 8h cardio\n\n* Mon:  Rest\n* Tues: 6.4 miles easy\n* Wed: 7.7 miles moderate + 13.4 miles easy\n* Thu: 6.2 miles trails\n* Fri: 13 miles easy\n* Sat:  Rest\n* Sun: 16 miles easy\n\n**Week 4:**\n\n* Mon: 9.3 miles moderate\n* Tues: 8 miles moderate\n* Wed: 8.4 miles easy\n* Thu: 11.3 miles easy\n* Fri:  BIKING: 1 hour easy\n* Sat:  12.2 miles easy\n* Sun: 14.6 miles easy\n\n**Week 5:** 8 h cardio\n\n* Mon: BIKING: 1 hour easy\n* Tues: 6.6 miles easy\n* Wed: 9 miles, 8x(2 min 5k pace, 2 min easy)\n* Thu: 9 miles recovery\n* Fri: BIKING: 1 hour easy\n* Sat:  18 miles easy\n* Sun: 11 miles easy\n\n**Week 6:** 8 h cardio\n\n* Mon: BIKING: 1 hour easy\n* Tues: 9.4 miles easy\n* Wed: 10 miles moderate\n* Thu: 8 miles easy\n* Fri: 7.5 miles easy\n* Sat:  8 miles: Progressive 800s reducing by 10s each time until failure.\n* Sun: 15.5 miles easy\n\n**Week 7:** 7h 38m cardio\n\n* Mon: BIKING: 1 hour easy\n* Tues: Rest\n* Wed: 10 miles easy\n* Thu: 7.2 miles easy\n* Fri: 9.3 miles moderate\n* Sat:  11.4 miles easy\n* Sun: 11.6 miles easy\n\n**Week 8:** 7 h 48m cardio\n\n* Mon: BIKING: 1 hour easy\n* Tues: 9 miles easy\n* Wed: 8.5 miles: 4x(1 mile at 10km pace, 2 min rest)\n* Thu: 5.5 miles recovery\n* Fri: 7.2 miles easy\n* Sat:  10.6 miles easy\n* Sun: 14.2 miles easy\n\n**Week 9:** 3.5 h cardio.

During the race consume 25 ml of caffeine (or more) per 5km, it helps tremendously!\n* Get a good hat to protect yourself from the sun.\n* Bring your phone. There's a good chance you could get lost. Plus, many 100km races aren't marked well.\n* Highly recommend having a pacer the last 20 miles. I know for certain on this particular race I would never have finished without my friend giving me encouragement.\n* In some ways, the faster you can move the better, you don't need to run fast, you just need to keep moving.\n* GUs were my downfall. It's a good idea to eat real food while training so that when you're in the race your body will be more accepting.\n* If it's hot, salt is a lifesaver. Also, keep drinking water.\n* Be prepared to be sore for weeks afterwards. But, make sure you get some good recovery walks in to help the healing process!\n* If you have a Garmin watch, if you turn off the HR monitor then the battery lasts almost twice as long allowing (for my forerunner 235) to go 16 hours.  \n\nThere wasn't a ton of competition in the race since most people dropped (it was very hot and humid that day). I considered dropping at mile 40 but since I was in the front I decided to suffer through. My aim was an 8 min/mile pace for the first 32 miles and then see if I could hold on. The first 25 miles I was running with a few other guys, but one by one they ended up falling behind as the sun came up. I ended up achieving about an 8 min/mile pace for the first 42 miles, but got badly dehydrated after throwing up all liquid I drank. Nutrition is definitely something I need to work on. At the 42 mile rest stop I ended up laying down and unable to get up for about 30 min. However, I managed to get up and keep going, the last 20 miles were treacherous, I just consumed salt and water and hobbled through the finish in 10h 46m winning by about 30 min (I guess the heat slowed down the other runners too). I'm confident that if it wasn't so hot I would have finished far quicker.\n\nNext race on my list: Eastern States 100!! (2023)"

I was hoping I could get a bit of advise on what to buy. The main purpose is cinematic video shoots, but I also want to be able to do dives, spins, etc. Comment on what kind of complete build I should get. Current, this is my current purchase plan:\n\n1. Nazgul5 Evoque F5D 6S HD (Caddx polar vista)  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0936Z2N78/?ref=idea\\_lv\\_dp\\_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0936Z2N78/?ref=idea_lv_dp_)\n2.

GoPro Hero9 (already have two)\n\n Should this setup work? Also, what mode of controller should I get? Mode 1 or mode 2? Which is most common? Is there anything else you guys might recommend me purchasing or through different suppliers?\n\nI also have a bunch of other questions: What good is adding in a GPS? It's an extra $40 but is it helpful? How much for extra batteries? Is there a major noticeable difference between 6S and 4S batteries? What about flight times (5-7 min)? Does the props get in the way of the GoPro? What is the range of the DJI controller? What happens if you go outside that range?"

He *chose* to interrupt the predicted line of his fate by ending his life. Even still, it's an example of how certain circumstances impact each other. Who Eragon was when Angela read his future and who he was when he spoke to the Menoa Tree, and who he will become are all different. It isn't necessarily that he is destined to do a certain number of things, but rather that the path he is on now will most likely lead him to do such things. An unpredicted choice can change anything, and what those parameters are aren't set in stone like a destiny story. Regardless, the visions Eragon has or Angela's fortune telling are used loosely as foreshadowing. They're not necessarily completely binding. If they were, there wouldn't be much creative flexibility, making future stories too predictable.\n\nPerhaps try to see it from this perspective instead. *Read into it*. The story becomes much less generic-sounding when these things are pulled into consideration. There is much more to be taken from these books and its in the intimate details.\n\nIf you disagree with all of this, oh well. Just don't spread your dislike of the books here.

However, I'd like to give two scenarios to see how you guys would plan. These are also not encounters I'm planning on running, they're just random.\n\n1. You're planning a basic encounter for a party of four. They're basically all melee characters except for a wizard with the typical Fireball. The goal of the encounter is to send a wave of smaller enemies to give the party the sense of being overwhelmed, but one Fireball could wipe everything out. Would you plan it in a way that the Wizard would be able to use their Fireball to its fullest extent or would you plan it specifically around keeping the Wizard from being able to cast it? (Outside of a strategic plan during combat)\n2. You're planning an encounter with the BBEG. You've planned out how you'd like the encounter to go, but then you realize that one specific spell or event could cause everything to crumble in an instant. It's not a solution that they could easily stumble upon, but if they did, then everything could be trashed (from a DM perspective. I know it would feel amazing for the players, and that's something to consider.) Regardless, this isn't a possibility that you didn't see coming, it's one that you know is possible. Would you plan the encounter with the specific plot points necessary to ward against that spell/event or would you let the party have that chance?\n\nBasically, I'm just wondering how much you guys plan encounters to make sure they aren't absolutely ruined. At what point should the DM stop thinking about all the ways the party could trivialize an encounter and at what point should the DM just let the possibilities through?"

But it is God who is in control and that they shouldn't elevate themselves to God. Now from a Greco-Roman perspective I understand calling yourself a god is one of like. The major things you shouldn't do. But as far as being in control of your own life I feel like the gods...encourage it? Ive had to put my practice aside for a bit whenever I pray to Venus or other gods they always seem to tell me to trust myself and to grow in who I am. That I should be stronger in who I am as a person. \n\nI guess that's not really a question but like, I feel like a lot of pagans feel that way? That the gods aren't necessarily in *control* of all of us. Like maybe certain aspects but not everything. They guide us but don't force us to surrender ourselves? If I'm getting that correct."

Especially since I'm dealing with so much anxiety it makes me borderline dysfunctional. Besides all that. I applied to see a few doctors through state insurance. Co-pays are like $5-$10. I'm disabled, I have no insurance. However, I realized they never asked me about my living situation. I am unemployed atm (looking for a job, and found some potential opportunities). But I live with my parents. They pay for everything. Their salary is nowhere near the poverty line. So what if I don't qualify? What if the agency realizes I rely on my parents' income and therefore don't need this. But you know what? *It's not a big deal*. I'll just speak to my mom about it. And if it turns out a mistake was made I'll cancel those appointments.   \n\n\nAll of these things boil down to needing separate myself from my parents as an adult. I may be disabled and living under their roof but that doesn't mean I have to think, act and feel exactly the way they do. I refuse to react to small things like it's the end of the world. Not everything is my fault, especially because I'm having to teach myself. I will mess up, I will make mistakes. But that's ok! Yes life is scary but making mistakes is how we learn. Yea some mistakes are big fuck ups but being in a constant state of anger isn't healthy or normal! Thanks but no thanks"

I'm not sure how quickly I could get on T but I plan to come out around that time. \n\nThe reason I'm posting here is because my father is an LCMS pastor. Both my sisters are proud TERFS and my moms just weird. My dad is not the worst pastor out there. But he has some crazy faults. He does not like science. He has slapped my future career in the face saying we trust far too much in science and psychology and not enough in God. He doesn't even believe psychology is actual science and when I slipped up he said \"I'm glad you finally admit that\" \n\nMy problem is. I will never be able to debate him (or the rest of my family) from a scientific or theological standpoint. He's been to seminary and knows the books of the bible far more in seventeen years than I ever could in studying it for just one year. And I've... Honestly been avoiding reading the bible. Should I read it? Just to be able to better debate? I usually take points from this sub (or tiktok) that I find very useful because I am not smart enough to come up with rebuttles on my own. If he says something idk about I'm afraid my arguments going to shatter. Because that's the thing my therapist doesn't understand. *This will inevitable turn into an argument/battle of wits*.\n\n**I do not want to have to battle for my very god damn existence**  \n\nBut as I said. Science is irrelevant to these assholes anyways. And I never really experienced gender dysphoria until recently. I discovered I was trans at 19 through studying gender *euphoria*. There were a few signs as a kid but that will literally mean nothing to them. I don't even *understand* the science. Where the fuck do I begin? \n\nAnd going back to the previous paragraph about Christianity/spirituality. Realizing I was trans was an extremely spiritual experience for me. Weather it was god or the dieities I feel now (or maybe it was the happy chemicals if you wanna take an athiest view). I just felt something unexplainable. For a few weeks I felt comfortable at the alter. I had radically accepted I was trans 100x faster than I had being into girls. (I'm not straight either. I like men so it definitely wasn't that \"Oh I'm now straight in the eyes of the lord!). But quickly it became clear, the message my dad taught. God hates gay and trans people. So I started deconstructing. My dad is probably going to call this experience the devil or something. \n\n\nBut you can't fight a spiritual experience. That's fucking stupid. But gods know he's gonna try to facts and logic it. Everything is facts and logic. (Most of the time, unless someone has a miscarriage or dies, then we don't know \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af). But I feel entirely unprepared for something 11 months or more away. I feel like I'm putting on armor getting ready for battle. But my armor is rusty helmet and a stick. I'm either gonna say some fucked up nasty shit or hang up the zoom call. (Zoom is safest if I live on campus, I'm physically disabled and unable to drive so doing this in their home would be bad). \n\nI want to be as prepared as possible. Ive thought about coming out to my sister because she had the audacity to ask me two years ago when I know how she feels but last time we got to together she seemed less insane. But now I feel like *I'm* the one going insane. \n\nI know I need to have a safety plan. I have to get a job to save up money. I have to put in a seperate bank account so he can't take my money. But other than that I feel like an utterly hopeless fool. Like I'm going to get crushed by the absolute \"power and wisdom\" of Christianity or some shit. Or they might go the science route. This is getting too long. I'm gonna stop here."

                "body": "One thing that has always kind of bothered me about people perception of queerness (other than the fact sole people don\u2019t think we deserve basic human rights and some would like to have as the guest of honor at their Christian barbecue) is that there seems to be an obsession with sex. As soon as gays are thought of gay sex is as well. Which quite frankly upsets me a great deal as it completely undermines all the beautiful queer romances that have existed and best out the hateful forces of oppression and shame. This is a larger problem, but I think one component that specifically needs modification is terminology itself. Terms like gay and lesbian are very informal, and terms like homosexual and bisexual are both overly scientific and also sexual in nature as it\u2019s quite literally in the words themselves. To combat this some have opted for stressing the romantic spectrum, but this doesn\u2019t work either as it doesn\u2019t take in to account sexual attraction. This is why I was very glad to have discovered the term \u201chomoamorous\u201d which serves as both sexual and romantic. I would like to see a shift to words like this as it seems more respectable and doesn\u2019t hold the sexual connotations (which could really help spreading LGBT+ positive messages to younger people). What are your thoughts?"

                "body": "Firstly this may sound incredibly stupid I apologize if it does I\u2019m very ignorant also there is a tl;dr at the bottom.\n\n\nThis first part is just context to question, not necessarily important, but it felt needed. I\u2019ll try to keep it short.\n\nEssentially I\u2019ve been very into comic book characters for a very long time (since childhood as I assume most of you can relate to), with that being said I\u2019ve only read a hand full of actual comic books. When I was in elementary school I would always watch and rewatch superhero cartoons and movies (I basically lived/live in the middle of nowhere and only saw/see other kids during school plus I wasn\u2019t allowed to play with other kids, or go to other kids houses, and I had no internet connection for a long time so they (super heroes/fantasies) were kinda my only connection to the outside world), then in middle school I really got into movies and began collecting them, especially Marvel movies which I became utterly obsessed with. Eventually I got bored with them and moved on to other interests in 8-9th grade (sports, music, literature, and more high brow films). I was also very self conscious at the time and was worried people would see me as less cool, which I was very worried about back then, but recently I\u2019ve learned not to care as much. With that being said I have slowly begun to rediscover my love for superheroes now that I\u2019ve started watching \u201cBatman: The Animated Series\u201d which has really reminded how much I love the idea of superheroes. Now I want to get back into them, but this time I want to actually read the comics themselves and not just view them on a screen.\n\n\nNow to the actual question part (sorry for the extreme length and possible cringe inducement of the previous paragraph).\n\nWhat I need to know is where exactly does one start. To my understanding at least for DC and I assume Marvel that there are multiple universes and timelines. I know (or I think I\u2019ve pieced together over the years) that in DC there used to be a bunch of universes since the 50s then in the 80s \u201cCrisis On Infinite Earths\u201d happened in which they all collided into one singular Earth. Then in the 10s rebooted twice with \u201cThe New 52\u201d as a result of \u201cFlashpoint\u201d having 52 universes, and then came back together again in \u201cRebirth\u201d which if I\u2019m correct is still the current timeline. I don\u2019t really about the Marvel reboots, but I\u2019m pretty sure that they have been rebooted several times as well. I guess what I really need to know is where do I start? Do begin with Action Comics #1, and simply work my way up, or what. Do I read individual story arch\u2019s like \u201cThe Killing Joke\u201d, \u201cThe House of M\u201d, and \u201cSpider-Verse\u201d or what?\n\nI really want to read comic books (especially Batman, Teen Titans, X-Men and Spider-Man as they are easily my favorites thus far), but I have absolutely no idea where to begin. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking this and just typed something completely unnecessary, but I simply don\u2019t know where one is supposed to begin it even which books to buy. \n\nI doubt anyone would\u2019ve taken the time to read this, but if you did thank you, and an answer would be very much appreciated.\n\n\ntl;dr: what comics are you suppose to begin with so that you?\n\nAgain really sorry if this didn\u2019t make any sense."

If I told him I was lesbian, he\u2019d make some dumbass comment like he wishes he was lesbian so he could pull Emily or some shit. \n\nGunther: For sure. I wish we could befriend him the game. He\u2019d be really receptive and would put up pride flags around the library.\n\nPam: Uhhh sure. Definitely not at first, but once we\u2019ve gotten close I think I\u2019d tell her. She\u2019d be confused for sure especially about me being non-binary, but then she\u2019d awkwardly pat my shoulder and say she\u2019s glad I\u2019m happy. \n\nCaroline: Um of course. I\u2019m married to her daughter, so she\u2019d know anyway.

I think he would be chill about it though.\n\nJodie: Yep. She gives me big progressive mom who just wants to understand the youth.\n\nPierre: I would say no, but I\u2019m married to his daughter, so he kind of had no choice. I\u2019d tell him I\u2019m not non-binary just to watch the panic and confusion on his face.\n\nLewis: FUCK no. He\u2019d become uncomfortable and start making subtle comments about the good ol days and how he wishes things were still like that. Did he officiate my lesbian wedding? Sadly.

                "body": "CW: Mention of dysphoria and abuse\n\nI've been seeing old FB memories before I came out as trans enby and seeing me refer to myself as female in any way makes me cringe... but I also realize that despite telling one of my therapists and my mom over and over, \"Stop referring to me to my dead name and old pronouns when talking about my past\", when I imagine my past self, I see a little girl... But I don't want to call my child self that, so I just say \"When I was a kid\" (but I've always said \"When I was little\" or \"When I was young\")... I'm so confused. I've been hearing repeatedly that when you come out as your authentic gender, that's always what you were, regardless of what you felt before coming out... So why can't I see younger self as nonbinary? Sure, I identify as a femby now, but that's only because I have a miniscule amount of attachment to my assigned gender. Now that I am enby, I look at gendered things and even past memories where it involved things that are supposedly associated with gender (\"Guys only understand this\", \"girls only understand that\") and I go \"What does this even mean?\" Am I lying to myself? Am I just trying to fit into a mold? But at the same time, I am genuinely confused by gendered things... Is it my DPDR playing tricks with me? Maybe I Voidpunk truly does fit me well cuz nothing is starting to make sense anymore... I don't know if I can handle seeing my past self as female, even if it is technically correct but is it really? And all of these thoughts culminated because I flashed on the time my pastor, without me realizing it at the time, was trying to help to some inner child work in his office before Covid (This was before I explored the enby identity, I think)... When he told me to imagine my past self in that old house where my abusive stepmom lived (and my dad before he passed away), to imagine what \"she\" was going through, what would I say to \"her\"? I just broke down. I didn't know what to say to \"her\", I couldn't help \"her\", and then it hit me... despite living with my mom now, far away from my abuser, I am still \"her\", that little \"girl\" (funnily enough, this was before I knew that trauma is literally just our trauma repackaged as our child selves and, as I said, before I knew what inner child work was)... So yeah, I'm very confused at this point. I've been doing so much self-exploration for these past few years and... frankly I am tired. From trying to help the uneducated around me to understand my dysphoria, to debating on whether or not I should change my FB name, to whether or not I truly want top surgery despite the fact that I truly hate my chest but I also fear change and worry if I will freak out cuz I \"miss\" having a chest (even though I also see myself excited afterwards), I'm just... lost. And now that I've officially gained a new type of dysphoria that I don't think I can talk about because it'll just get me more ridicule, it's quite alot... I just wish I could wake up tomorrow and be ME. Whoever the hell that is supposed to be..."

It's pretty cool that the consort position is one so metal- doubles as a sort of High General, not what one would typically expect of a consort. \n\nI got the hourglass, and went up to the top of the Divine Tower of Liurna, therefore finding Ranni's corpse. That's where I got the Cursemark of Death! Just not sure what that means for the sake of the story, although I can tell it's something significant.\n\nYou said Marika established the Golden Order. Was Marika forced to establish the Golden Order because of the Greater Will? I'm confused about why she would rebell against it if she created it, unless somehow she didn't have power over it- which I could only see happening because of something involving the Greater Will being involved with its very establishment.\n\nThanks for explaining what the Tarnished are/were! It additionally makes sense as to why they're so determined to become Elden Lord, if they have a link to Godfrey, the first of their kind. They've got the sight of \"grace,\" so they feel like chosen pilgrims who can then reestablish the expectations of the Golden Order by taking the place of Elden Lord in Godfrey's place. I guess then they'd be Marika's consort? I feel a bit bad for her, as she doesn't really seem to have much say in any of this, despite being a God or whatever. Doubling down on supporting Ranni's plan, and wonder if there's a way we can save Marika.\n\nI imagine it's been many, many years since the Shattering, considering the utter disarray and overgrowth so many places in the Lands Between are in. It's really quite melancholic, I wish I could have seen everything in its hay day, because the architecture and terrain is so beautiful.\n\nI do have a couple more questions:\n\nWhat makes someone an Empyrean? It just sounds like they're chosen by the Greater Will, but that does little to explain if there's any criteria/inherent composition of the Empyreans regarding their potential godhood.\n\nAnd Goldmask has a lot to say about... anything?? Last I saw of him, he's been standing on that one bridge in the Atlas Plateau, pointing up at the Erdtree, completely silent. He's one of a few NPCs it seems like I can't do anything with, the other two being the Dung Eater, and the Boiled Prawn Guy.\n\nAnd yeah, I love talking about lore, and the world of the Lands Between is so entrancing, so this is super fun for me, too. I'm gonna warn you, though, in between work and how slow I am at playing games, you might have to wait a while for me to finish it! \ud83d\ude06",

Everything is so cryptic, tbh, but I've tried my best.\n\nMain issue in Lands Between is that everything is messed up with Death, and has been since the Goddess lady broke the Elden Ring (The Shattering). All the demigod people fought over the pieces of the Elden Ring to try and get power and... I'm really not sure what else. I talked to Ranni at the site of grace, and she said only her, Malenia, and Miqella were \"Empyrean\" and therefore able to be a God. So, I don't know what the other demigods were fighting over, if they had no chance.\n\n\nThere's this Greater Will thing, which essentially seems like Fate/Destiny. Don't know who is behind it, I think that Golden Order thing mentioned a few times that seems like a religion that worships the Two Fingers. The demigods also seem to be under the jurisdiction of the Golden Order/Greater Will, which is why there's been so much conflict since the Elden Ring got broken, because that really messed with the Golden Order/Greater Will.\n\nIn Ranni's quest, where I'm at so far, she seems to be the only person aside from the people at Volcano Manor (they should just work together, tbh) (also side note, not done with Volcano Manor quests yet) to oppose the Golden Order and Two Fingers so strongly, because Ranni said she rebelled against the fate the Two Fingers had for her, and \"stole the cursemark of death.\" She seems to have destroyed her original body, leaving this cursemark of death thing behind. I am... not sure what this means, haha. But the Golden Order seems cultish, and I never like concepts like Fate/destiny controlling people, so if Ranni's working against that, then so am I.\n\nI'm still not quite sure what a Tarnished is, lol. People that don't die? It seems like nobody really dies anymore (since Death got all messed up).",

I just play the game, try my best, try to limit internet advice for what I \"should\" do, and now I'm 90~ hours in, level 65, generally having a good time outside of periodic fits of frustration.\n\nAnywho, Astel is really hard and it's driving me a bit mad. The camerawork is also really frustrating for when I get close (I'm melee with dual wielding daggers).\n\nIt looks like I hardly have any opportunities to get close to him, and I burn through my 11 flasks like it's nothing. It's just constant punishment, and then death. I can't even get him to half health. My biggest hangup seems to be his palm-to-ground slam that sends out multiple waves of aftershock- as I have no idea how to dodge all of them consecutively. I usually seem to get around 1-2/3 dodged, and then the last one slams me.\n\nSecondary ones are the punch-orb-that-scatters-exploding-stardust and the grab-and-eat insta-kill, although I've successfully dodged that last one three times, now. It seems random when he teleports, whether he's gonna just appear elsewhere or do that, but if I can't see him immediately, I can assume he's about to divebomb from above. I've noticed rolling towards him seems to help with that one, since he meets me halfway. \n\nThe punch-orb-that-scatters-exploding-stardust is really frustrating, as it's hard to dodge while I'm close. It seems his whole arm becomes a hit box, when he does that attack, and as a melee who is generally trying to attack his face, it's like I get caught on his arm before I even have time to react.\n\nIf my names for the attacks are confusing- fair enough, I came up with them myself, and I'll clarify as needed. Hope you guys can give advice! I'm really up a wall about this guy, and he kills all of my summons immediately. ;_;\n\nEdit: Playing on Playstation and don't have PS+ for Co-op, sorry, forgot to mention!\n\nEdit, Edit: Ty very much, everyone! I kept at it, and now he's dead! Don't know how many attempts that was, probably 25~ total, but I'm happy!"

I've been doing so much better about giving myself grace in recent years and am generally good at managing my emotions, but I've been irrationally angry this whole evening, and I feel like I'll explode.

I'm tired of forgetting schedules and passwords. I'm tired of forgetting info about people, some I've even known for years, from birthdays, to preferences, to ages, etc. I'm tired of forgetting my own damn life and memories! It seems like other people remember stuff about me better than I do, from things like inside jokes, to heartfelt moments, and so on! \n\nAt the end of it all, I guess this is about more than a burner, and that was the tipping point. I'm just tired of being like this, and despite my best efforts with self scheduling, alarms, and time management, I can't get my brain to think deliberately.

I'm trying to think if I really want that irritating reality even with what would be a cool name. Juniper is *called* a gender neutral name, but it's still got a female-leaning skew. Additionally, while Junis sounds like a \"name\" name, Juniper is, y'know, a planty hippie name. Albeit, that wouldn't exactly be unfitting for my personal image, hah, but I do like the adaptability of Junis as opposed to Juniper.\n\nAnyway, rambling aside, give me your honest thoughts on Junis?"

See, I'm a lesbian, and frankly, wouldn't be able to handle to having a male in a polycule. But, in the event I have a pan or bi partner, I wouldn't want to deny them to explore other sides of their sexuality. I'd be fine with them seeing men on a sexual standpoint, but I wouldn't them to form an established relationship with them, because, as far as my understanding goes, that'd simply be an open relationship at that point, since I would never have an interest in this person as well.\n\nHow have situations like this worked among any of you with similar sentiments to mine? Are there polycules where all individuals may not have an interest in one another? I can be bad in that it's hard for me to trust cis men, especially if they were to be involved in this sensitive of an area in my life (I realize this sounds sexist, and I hope I'm not breaching rules or hurting others through saying this), so even if I was fine with a partner seeing someone else, it'd be hard for me to compromise in fields such as, inevitably, being around them more frequently, having them in my home, etc.\n\nSorry this is a bit of a tangent, but I would greatly appreciate your responses and lived experiences in which I am personally lacking. Additionally, please correct me on any misinformation or incorrect notions I've stated above.

However, there's still the drawback that you're the main instigator for said quests, and have to follow the criteria that's given to you.\n\nI brought up the Fate system in FFXIV, in which you sort of come across certain scenarios, and that the world feels alive and changing without your input, and you can choose to involve yourself or walk away. If this kind of a system could be Incorporated in a way to establish world building, lore, and an interesting storyline *without* the player being the defining factor, I think that'd be neat.\n\nThis is more of a fluffy element, but I brought up how achieving this might be easier if the player themselves was a merchant, acting as a product driven, travelling, neutral party to whatever the world may have to offer.\n\nAnyone know of any games like the scenarios I've listed above?"

I was thinking about a way it could've been executed in retrospect, and I'm just wondering if we could've let the possession thing simmer a little longer.\n\nThat duty was *this* close to being the Scions v. WOL scenario I've wanted since the WOL was almost overcome with light in SHB, except it could've worked! So what if it was tweaked a bit?\n\nThe WOL finishes their part of the duty, and the screen fades to black as the point of focus shifts. Same scene with the Scions noticing \"your\" arrival, and they approach Zenos disguised as the WOL with excitement, only to find that the person who appears as their companion is anything but. However, instead of the WOL jumping in at that moment, I say G'raha and Alisaie are joined by the other Scions, and react quickly, defending themselves from Zenos' initial attack in your form.\n\nThus begins the duty continued from the Scions' perspective of fighting against Zenos while habiting the WOL's body, obviously while controlling a specific Scion. I'd pick between Alphinaud or G'raha (Alisaie already gets a duty during END, and I know Alphinaud does as well, but this is a pivotal moment, and I'd love to hear Alphinaud's thoughts of fighting the WOL, their longtime companion, while I'm sure Alisaie would be yelling her thoughts out anyway), but it really doesn't matter for me.\n\nI was thinking that this idea might be difficult to implement, because \"oh, but everyone has a different job, so I don't know, the custom actions from a WOL boss fight might be too difficult,\" but the fact that in the cutscene where Zenos-WOL ambushes G'raha and Alisaie while using a Reaper skill removes that fear. They could use actions similar to the Zenos duel in the finale, which would already be existing. The only potentially difficult factor would be assigning your character model to doing said action animations, which I admittedly, from a game designer's perspective, don't know how that would work. (But to be honest, this whole fantasy is purely spurned from 'wouldn't that be badass?' so I'm not being entirely practical.)\n\nThis whole premise of the Scions having to fight against the face of their friend, while also getting slowly pushed back/exhausted is not only tragic, but raises the stakes even more. You are here, as the player, worried for your WOL's body, and the well-being of the Scions, and are wondering how long they'd last without you.\n\nAs a potential additional factor...\n\nRemember that timer from the duty with Hien, where it said \"Time until WOL arrives?\" This would've a great time to do a similar callback, as that was in a fight against Zenos possessed by Elidibus, iirc, simultaneously creating a fun parallel. However, having a timer for the WOL's arrival would take away the surprise from the WOL's rescue of the Scions in the actual cutscenes' climax. Thus, I propose a simple, and chilling alternative:\n\n\"Time until Zenos tires of this.\"\n\nA ticking clock that, from the player's perspective, establishes the fact that, while the Scions are making a noble, collective stand, *Zenos is choosing to hold back throughout all of this, and could wipe them out with your form if he so chose.* This leads to the assumption that, once the clock strikes zero, Zenos would trigger an insta kill. \n\nSo, we're watching the clock tick down, and the Scions getting weaker. Perhaps Lucia runs in at one point, only to be quickly driven back, and the Scions tell her to *\"get everyone ready to flee the camp if need be! Something is terribly wrong!\"*\n\nThe clock runs down, and you're probably there sweating bullets, fearing the worst, and then a cutscene hits that's similar to the one we see in canon. Zenos is about to land a killing blow on two nearest Scions, which could still be Alisaie and G'raha from the original cutscene, only to be foiled by the true WOL throwing their sword (god, I loved that part), and crashing into him while he's off guard, before reclaiming their body.\n\nI think the whole encounter, played out that way, would've been even more intense than before, and have wracked the Scions, and Camp Broken Glass, much, much more than it did in the story, as a result of things being drawn out.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? I had this pop into my head, and just had to write it down."

Mostly when I have ideas I wanna act upon them and not just sit around talking about them. As to what they are about? Varies. Some ideas are about how we could improve the world, specifically usa because that's where I'm from so it effects the people around me the most. Others are more light hearted like taking a trip to Poland to meet some hotties with the bros.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nDefinitely would. Being admired by people around you is an amazing feeling. I do seek validation from others, even if I try to hide it.

Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nCoordinated? As in organized? In ultimately depends in what, I would say I'm not that organized of a person.

If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nHighly depends on what. But I do usually help others, especially if they are people I'm close to. \n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYes very much so. Sometimes people don't understand my logic but that's because it's my own logic, nobody else's. I need to do stuff that makes sense to me personally. And base most of my decisions off of that. \n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI think efficiency and productivity is important to keep your life interesting and moving forward, not getting complacent. I don't like to control others though, and don't want them to control me either. Just chillax and vibe with each other dude. \n\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nAs I said earlier, hell no. I hated school bro, with a passion. The learning wasn't for me. I need a more hands on approach, that's my main learning style. \n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nMost the time I procrastinated and wing it as I go ngl lmao, but I'm actually really good under pressure and can improvise really well to my advantage. \n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI want to have a career where people look up to me and admire me. Something that impacts people and makes a difference in the world. Most people are so self absorbed and selfish and that's why it doesn't happen often. \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nFailure is a very big one, don't get me started on that dude. And probably my main one. The reasoning is simple, if I don't reach the goals I want I'd feel like a disappointment to the people around me. \n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI'm pretty grounded In the present moment. I don't really daydream often and if I do I'm really bored, and totally in my head zoned out. \n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nWell first, obviously try to break out and try to keep my cool. But if none of that worked, probably about life man, and after that maybe a few fantasies of mine. But we can keep it pg-13 my dudes lmaoo\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nNot really a big factor to me. I find people that get wrapped up in emotions usually make reckless and selfishly stupid decisions. \n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nDepends. If I really know the person I'm gonna be pretty blunt and myself, and letting them know if I personally don't see the logic in their opinion and probably debate them. If it's someone I don't know very much, I go along with it sometimes because I wanna be viewed in a good light. \n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI love to challenge authority lmao, if they aren't really consistent in their decisions and it isn't what's best for everyone they ain't doing that good of a job. Which is true most times. The government is selfish and corrupt I tell you. And if me rebelling pisses them off, I'm a happy man.  Plus it's fun, let's be honest dudes."

I\u2019ve even had various dreams where I\u2019ve been ruthlessly killing people myself, and planning how to hide the body, even going as far as laughing while I\u2019m being chased by the police.

An agreement that sets all sorts of property ownership, taxation, parental, estate management and other legal criteria into place.\n\nBut again, this doesn't answer why this legal setup should be considered a *marriage.* Marriage has/had a meaning and nobody acknowledges that. Like, my brother lives with my sister's family. He loves them, and helps support and care for them. If all it is is a legal agreement between two people who care about each other, why can't my brother marry my sister and her boyfriend? They love each other, they're adults, they live together, they support each other, he helps care for the kids and repair their house... So why not?\n\n >You have no more right to bar that legal process from two gay individuals that want to form a legal union than you do to bar them from any other legal process\n\nOn what basis?\n\n>The fact that you are suggesting your religious beliefs should trump their legal rights is\u2026wrong. The fact that you keep doubling down on it is\u2026disturbing.\n\nActually, what I *said* was that my religious beliefs on any given matter are functionally no different from your non-religious beliefs.

So be careful about that, K?\n\nAnd ftr, I had that exact same stance of treating them like I would anyone else.. but things change, and that was no longer good enough for them. \n\nAs for biology, I'm sure I don't have to go into how the human reproductive system works with you, haha. Perhaps you *can* do to other things, but just because you *can* get a guy off by going through the backdoor doesn't mean that *justifies* the act in any way. You intestines serve a purpose of *digestion*. This is very clear. People *can* do a lot of things, and the fact that we *can* generally doesn't have any bearing on whether an act is moral or justified. So why does it matter so much, here?\n\nYou're right that love and procreation don't necessarily go hand in hand. But I'm not talking about love here, I've said before that I don't think love alone can justify a relationship (and you responded by appealing to other problems with those pairings, which kind of implicitly is agreeing with the point that love alone can't justify them, I have to say).\n\nBut what I'm saying is that, if someone were to tell me being straight is wrong, I can very easily appeal to the general rules of how our bodies work, how our reproductive systems are designed, and the fact that the survival of our species depends on people being straight, as bases for my position. As far as I can tell, when you do the same, you're appealing to the fact that you *can* do it, it feels good, other people and sometimes animals do it (side note, animals also eat each other alive and kill the offspring of their sexual competition and we don't use that as an excuse to act similarly), and to your personal emotions on the matter.

But, if you want to be intellectually honest, you should be consistent. If you wouldn't say the principle is true for the examples i gave (and there are many more such examples), that means the principle *is not true.* And if it's not something you can apply consistently to most situations, then it's not a good basis for your moral views and reasoning. \n\nAnd yes, they could still face eternal punishment after all that.

Sorry of that comes off as harsh but there's really no way to sugar coat my experiences.\n\n\nAlso, I'm a Christian. As a Christian, I'm well aware that I've done many sinful things in my life, and some of those things came very naturally to me and benefitted me in some way. Coming to terms with the sinfulness of them wasn't a carnival of happy feelings. But how I feel about it doesn't change the reality of the situation. \n\nAlso, there's not really that much to think about there. Our reproductive systems are clearly meant for opposite-sex relationships. That literally is their purpose. So you're asking me how I'd feel if everyone told me to ignore basic biology, which incidentally is something that happens frequently nowadays. But you're not looking into the *why* of it.

It was quite compact-looking and sort of square-shaped. It was maybe about the size of one of my smaller fingernails - maybe around 1 cm long, give or take. It had 6 legs and distinct antennae. It was a gray-brown colour, with a slight orange tinge, and mottled; it looked kinda fuzzy but I suppose that may have been the mottling. Reminded me of like, rotting vegetation or something like that. What I thought was most interesting was its movement - it would move forward, and then go at like 90 degrees to the side, like how a crab would walk.  \n\n\nAnd yeah, I live in Sydney, NSW, Australia for reference.  \n\n\nAnyone have any ideas? I was just fascinated by its movement in particular. Hadn't seen anything like it before."

                "body": "Hi guys,\n\nI bought my first real leather jacket online and got it just the other day (I would've rather been able to try it on in the shop, but long story short it's not really doable for me). And despite my best efforts to measure well before ordering, it doesn't fit right. It's a biker jacket with the zipper fairly far over to the side, so my best guess is that somehow that's made the fit a bit off from the size guide on the website. But I know leather stretches a bit as you wear it, so I'm wondering just how much of an issue it will be in the long run, and thought I'd ask people who may be more knowledgeable than me :P\n\nSo basically, it's slightly tight in the shoulders and sleeves - but close enough that I feel pretty confident it'll be fine later on as I wear it. However, in the body, it's a little bit difficult to zip up, and it scrunches around my waist and rides up a little bit (I'm a woman so my hips maybe don't help things). I figure if it were maybe about 4 cm wider in the body, it'd fit just right (which would be basically the same as exchanging it for one size up, which is a 5 cm difference - which I had initially thought would make it too big, but I guess not, haha). But will my jacket stretch 4 cm worth as I wear it? Or if I exchange it for a size up, will it end up getting too loose over time as I wear it? I'm willing to consider other solutions, too. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Thanks in advance!"

                "body": "I'm fairly new to learning Polish, and something occurred to me today as I was practicing with things around me. I was practicing sentences about a neighbourhood dog I know, and was thinking of phrases like \"She is a good dog\", when it occurred to me that I don't actually know if it's common to refer to animals as he/she, vs it, in Polish. I tried looking it up but couldn't find an answer.\n\nSo, what pronouns to Polish-speakers use when referring to animals?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: since I'm getting a bit confused by some answers, I want to clarify that I'm *not* talking about grammatical gender, I'm talking about pronouns as they relate to animals. and conventions around that. Keeping in mind that I'm fairly new to Polish, here's some examples:\n\n- in reference to the above example with \"she's a good dog\", what I'm concerned with is whether you refer to animals as he or she in the same way you would a human being. I call a girl dog \"she\", I call a girl human \"she\". I'd say \"that's her ball\" talking about a girl dog's ball, I'd say \"that's her ball\" talking about a girl human's ball. Would you do the same in Polish, or is there some other convention? (For example, calling a dog \"it\" regardless of sex unless the sex is relevant, or having a different set of pronouns for animals specifically, etc). I just figured that languages have all sorts of conventions and maybe I shouldn't assume that you apply pronouns to animals in the same way that you do to people.\n\n- I know two words for \"they\", and this is my understanding of them: \"one\" if it's all female people, and \"oni\" if there's at least one man in the group. But what about if I wanted to talk about a group of animals? If I said \"They are big\" referring to people I'd use oni or one, but if I said \"They are big\" in reference to horses or elephants, what would the pronoun be?\n\nHopefully this clarifies my question! Thank you!"

It did well for Choi Yujin and she debuted in Kep1er but does CUBE really think that'll work the same for Hui? It's too early to call it off but I'm having mixed feelings.\n\nDoes UNIVERSE (Pentagon fandom) want Hui to debut in the new Boys Planet group or do they want him more to stay in PENTAGON?\n\nI know he joined there for a reason so I can't just not support him (unless it was more of the company's choice). I still wish PENTAGON and Hui the best but is joining Boys Planet really the only way? I want to support him but he won't be in PENTAGON anymore I guess (like Choi Yujin, Wooseok and Jinhyuk).\n\nThe other scenario though is that it'll turn out like NU'EST in Produce 101 but with Hui alone, I don't think it's enough for the netizens to tune in to PENTAGON if Hui debuts in the new group."

                "body": "**Ending Fairy** is a title given to the member/s who have a solo close-up shot to the camera at the end of the performance. Cameras would stay to the member for at least 2-3 seconds before ending the performance. It has become a trend and 'thing' in KPOP for the past few years. No one payed much attention to who's the last shot of the performance (though most endings also focused on a group shot or like lasts for 1 second) until Produce 101.\n\nI think the 'Ending Fairy' title started with **I.O.I/D.I.A's Jung Chaeyeon** when she was in Produce 101, specifically Ep.3 aired in February 6, 2016. She was the center in their 'Into The New World' performance and gained the nickname 'Ending Fairy' after looking flawlessly beautiful at the end. Her visuals trended and she was always the ending fairy for each mission. The original aired clip of their Into The New World performance was deleted maybe because of the backlash for Chanmi so I just linked her  fancam.\n\nProduce 101 - [Into The New World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2JrPCGwEE), [Full Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iBp-mD7itg), [Yum Yum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qex5g3lcl_w)\n\nAfter Jung Chaeyeon, Produce 101 Season 2's Nayana (2017) had 8 ending fairies, but ending fairy, 'Wink Boy', **Park Jihoon** stole the show! I also think Lee Daehwi started the 'tired and breathing heavily' ending pose in Nayana. Becoming the ending fairy started becoming a big thing because the trainees needed that exposure and screentime. More and more idols were also trending for being ending fairies like Red Velvet's Irene. Since then, most trainees and idols always practice their ending fairy pose.\n\nMost ending fairies have a cool or flawless look on their face until this year, SHINee's Key started being funny with their funny expressions and notes, which was followed by most idols nowadays!\n\nI had this thing in my mind after watching Girls Planet 999 where they dedicated almost a minute for ending fairies. Produce X 101 had more ending fairies in their signal song though (16 trainees!!!) but it was a performance of all the competitors and not just 33 people so it was understandable."

Up until recently I was only practicing with my father privately and felt no need to wear a binder while with him, even though I wear one pretty much everywhere else. But now that I have gotten into the competitive field I am highly uncomfortable being in public without a binder. I know that it is dangerous to wear a binder while exercising, and that is the only reason I have not done it yet. Taekwando relies on kicks and turns mainly and a binder would also restrict my movements in a way that I cannot afford now that I am competitive. Still, I am majorly uncomfortable being in public and competing without something hiding my chest. And I was wondering if anyone has found any other solutions for exercising while still hiding your chest in one way or another. And and also, thank you for reading this far, I appreciate it."

I am VERY unhappy with my body as a female, and I would MUCH rather be male. But, lately I have been doubting myself because it is really hard to imagine myself as a boy, or even people calling me by he/him pronouns. So far nobody has called my by he/him pronouns, and I am afraid to ask because I am fairly certain my family is transphobic. I also think I am quite stereotypically feminine around people because my family has always treated me as such. I always feel like there is a disconnect between myself and both genders, but I know that I am not non-binary or gender fluid. So I don't really know anymore if I am actually trans or just cis and confused."
