Did the scientist / analyser made sure that their bais wasn't affecting their decision while collecting said data.\nWhile data is by far the best way to prove or disprove a said point. Its by no chance a solid proof. Many collection of data goes against people's own personal experience and that shouldn't be dismissed. \nBecause obviously studies like these only question a small chunk of population not eveyone. \nThat being said\nIn my own experience ( people around me ) if i divide these people into 4 groups both by gender and age. I would say : \n1. older people are more likely to be religious than younger people. \n2. In younger generation men are more likely to be religious (vastly Because younger generation women are fueled to fight off old cultural beliefs and \"rebel\" to get control of their life)\n3. In older generation women are more likely to be religious (most probably because of lack of freedom they were given and the cultural brainwashing of \"do as you're told\")\nThis obviously is my own personal opinion im sure eveyone here has different views.

I think u probably have to go to the modern day horror movies bc I think they cut back on nudity, but idk cuz I don\u2019t watch modern horror movies. But modern horror movies do not cut back on gore which is what I am sure of since CGI stuff came in. Idk for horror movies for a ten year old. It depends on his maturity level and if he can handle the some of the scenes. Jaws is a debatable movie whether or not it is horror or not, but it does have some elements. Jaws is appropriate for a ten year old I am sure of. U can always check common sense media too. U can always skip some of the scenes that u think he cannot handle.",

                "body": "[CW: describing sexual and romantic preferences without overly explicit detail, and relating it to parental issues]\n\n(M19) So first I'm just gonna clarify what I mean by mommy kink because it means wildly different things to different people. I'm not interested in incest, quite the opposite; the motherly traits I find attractive in women are usually the ones my bio mom lacks, and I believe I have a normal/healthy amount of disgust for genuine incest. Not into age play at all, pedophilia is abhorent. Also not into being treated like a literal baby, or avoiding responsibilities in a relationship, or bdsm, or being bossed around at all (already had enough of the last one from my bio mom for one lifetime).\n\nSo all that out of the way, what I do like about \"mommy\" stuff is being nurtured and feeling safe and supported and cared for in some sexual, romantic, and other contexts by a dominant maternal figure. Haven't had a serious relationship before but I'd only bring this up with a potential partner in an open clear conversation, and wouldn't pressure them to doing anything they're not interested in, and I'd try to make sure we set clear boundaries before hand, and I wouldn't want it to be much more than an occasional thing. Atm it's just a fantasy I have from time to time.\n\nMade this post because I read through a thread where loads of people were saying mommy kinks are disgusting and those people really need therapy, but is it that necessary for me? Is what I described very unhealthy or unreasonable? Or were those people either just kink shaming, or refering more to the types of people I listed in my first paragraph?\n\nBtw I don't exactly have access to therapy so if I do need professional help idk how to go about that other than months of introspecting and discussing my self psychoanalysis with supportive friends like I have with a few other unrelated psychological things.\n\nTl;dr: do I need professional help when it comes to my mommy fetish? Also thanks in advance"

I myself am bi but I usually only find top energy attractive so maybe since I don't find very (idk if I should say fem or sub or bottom but that general vibe) people that attractive it's hard for me to wrap my head around how I could possibly maybe be attractive at some point. I get how some people might just like femininity but be straight or something so only like guys, but especially to the bisexual rr women, why would you ever choose an rr boy over a fem lesbian?\n\nSorry if this is a stupid question or if I'm just burdening you guys with my own insecurities but overthinking hasn't got me anywhere and I don't know who else to ask.

There's been [one video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaSUBzkAGV8) from Crossing Channel on the topic, and a few scattered forum posts, but aside from that, nothing.\n\nBasically, since the newest update, villagers cannot be found in the museum when they normally should be. Instead they will just be gone, nowhere to be found. You won't be able to find them in Able Sisters, Nook's Cranny, other villagers' houses, somewhere outside, or anywhere until the game decides they've \"exited\" the museum. For me it has been a near-daily thing at this point that one random villager will be missing. I have not seen a villager in the museum a single time since I started my island, and I check every day.\n\nThankfully, it's easy enough to fix by just reloading the game, but it's still quite annoying and immersion-breaking, since I usually have to do this once a day.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug that affects everyone, but it has affected me and most of the commenters on Crossing Channel's video. Let me know in the replies if you've had a villager go missing recently, or seen them in the museum at all. \n\nTLDR: You're not going crazy, your villagers are going missing and it's a bug."

It was then somehow taken as gospel by every MBTI forum ever, despite being inconsistent with basically every other model. Places like /r/mbti will wank on about how the dichotomy approach of 16personalities is terrible, and the cognitive function stack is the way to go, but their only source is \"dude trust me.\"\n\nI'd think the trademark INTJ objectivity would have them at least attempt to fact-check this stuff, but then I'll see the occasional astrology post pop up and at that point I've just lost all faith in humanity.\n\nSo is there actually anything out there that suggests cognitive functions exist, or is it essentially just psychological make-believe?"

                "body": "League of Legends can be a frustrating game. Tilt happens to the best of us, and most of the time, tilt is the reason why we aren't playing at our best.\n\nSome players tilt loudly. Flaming in chat, spam pinging, or even starting to intentionally feed or go AFK. Other players tilt quietly, muting everyone and just tuning out of the game. But all players have experienced at least one of these mentalities before - and so have you. If you haven't, you're an exception among exceptions. Any player could stand to take a look at themselves and how they view the game, because getting rid of tilt will make you play better, and enjoy the game more.\n\n**Harmful mentality #1: I always get bad teams.**  \nThe Expert shakes his head condescendingly. His team, he thinks to himself, is a lost cause, and belongs in the depths of Iron 7. Clearly, their build is wrong. Their play style is wrong. Their macro is wrong. Everything about them is wrong. It's just so *frustrating.* Why can't they see it?\n\nWith this mentality, you focus on everyone except yourself. Every perceived mistake from your team tilts you more. But this is an aspect of the game that will never go away. Don't try to argue with your team to get them to play better, because you'll almost never be able to change anyone's mind, and you'll probably just end up tilting each other more.\n\nUnderstand that the players in your games are, on average, playing at the skill level of that rank. And unless you've been winning a lot of games recently, you're playing at that skill level too, so your judgments may not be as on-point as you think they are. Be humble and open to learn, and see your teammates' failings as part of the game rather than an obstacle to your success.\n\n**Harmful mentality #2: Losing isn't cool.**  \nThis is the ego player. The big man. The game is a stage, and he's the star of the show. He is better than you, higher ranked than you (on his smurf, really!), and he has had intercourse with your mother.\n\nExcept when he starts losing. Then the insecurity sets in.\n\nWith this mentality you focus too much on how others see you. You find yourself looking at your KDA all the time. You feel that pit in your stomach when you make a bad play and somebody starts spamming the \"?\" ping on you. You might even find yourself lashing out in chat, making excuses and irrational arguments to deflect blame away from yourself.\n\nThis is a difficult mentality to truly shake off, and a lot of it just comes with maturity. But try to understand that your team doesn't really care how badly you're playing - they're mostly concerned with protecting their own egos, and you're a convenient target to flame if you have a bad KDA. When you find yourself having a bad game, just take a deep breath, mute people if you need to, and use it as a learning opportunity for playing from behind. Because it's going to happen again.\n\n**Harmful mentality #3: I need to rank up.**  \nThis is it. This is the season you're going to make it to Diamond. But wait, you've had a bad start this game. You just died to a jungle gank. Your bottom lane is 0/3. You're in your last game of promos. Oh no, what if you *lose?!*\n\nWith this mentality you tilt because you're anxious over losing. You focus too much on things like win rate, your LP compared to yesterday, and future goals. You're prone to highs and lows, winning streaks and losing streaks. You also probably need to get outside more, and maybe have a shower.\n\nWhile League of Legends is a very competitive game, it is still only a game. Nothing bad will happen if you lose a few LP, and nothing really good will happen if you get to Diamond, either. League games take a long time, and it takes a huge time investment to actually rank up significantly. At the end of the day your rank doesn't matter. Just focus on improving your play.\n\n**Harmful mentality #4: This game just isn't fun anymore.**  \nOh, the humanity. Your team is starting to lose and flame each other. Your opponent's champion is just so not fun to play against. It's 30 minutes into the game, and you just want it to be over. You're not like those other players who only care about winning. You just want to have fun. So why aren't you having fun?\n\nThis is a hard question to answer, and it's different for everyone. But ultimately, if you're having fun playing the game, you'll tilt less and play better. Think about what drew you to the game in the first place. What roles, champions, and play styles do you like best? The meta doesn't matter too much in solo queue, and you can pretty much just play what you want, so play what you want. (Within reason.)\n\nTry taking a break from the pressure of ranked, and play a few normals. Experiment with things. If something's not fun, try something else. Improving at the game doesn't have to cost you your enjoyment of it."

They would take me out to places to have fun, would help and support me, etc. I felt loved with them, I was happy with them. They were available to me always. And this love was consistent, every weekend i'd go to my grandparents.\n\nI feel like I don't deserve to be traumatized, I shouldn't have all these issues because I had stability and love in my life. Why wasn't the selfless love they showed me not enough? I feel like an imposter knowing I lived a better life than so many of you here, and yet i'm just as worse off if not more.\n\nI do know that as a child I was emotionally closed off despite having those I cared about around me. My mom told me I never told her a thing about how my dad made me feel. I never told her about any of the abuse towards me until these last few years.

It's either a mistranslation or misconception that's been repeated so many times that people think it's true. Let me quote the original Polish description. Geralt about Yen:\n\n'Nadal patrzy\u0142. Mia\u0142a figur\u0119 dwudziestolatki, cho\u0107 jej prawdziwego wieku wola\u0142 nie zgadywa\u0107'\n\nThe correct translation is that she had a figure of a 20 years old, not face. In Polish language this is a reference to your body shape and fitness only, and absolutely nothing else!\n\nOn top of that, I want you all to ask yourself a question: How did you imagine the sorceresses while reading about the Thanedd banquet or meetings of the lodge? Did you imagine a bunch of girls who just finished high school and entered their 20s or women, older, in their 30s? If so, ask yourself why? Remember that a lot of them are 100+ years old. As you get older, you change and it's not just your body, but you also develop a taste, your character is different too. You become more refined and find elegance and class, or at least that's something that the sorceresses were. With certain character comes a specific look. In such a sophisticated environment, would you really choose to look like a child or more woman-like but still sexy? \n\nIn my opinion Eva Green is the only perfect casting. I could throw a few others, but she is just born to be Yennefer.\n\nEdit: Because some of you still don't understand: I made this post to bust the look myth, not to make a case for Eva to be in Netflix's shipwreck."

While on high temperatures I don't experience freezing or disruptions in games, but the fans are obviously very loud and the temperatures are very concerning to me. It's always been like this since I bought it (Dec 2019). The laptop is good for daily tasks, but it was one advertised as a 'gaming laptop' so it's very disappointing that the moment I actually want to use it for gaming I get anxiety over temperatures hitting 95C. Is it normal and I am just paranoid? Is it possible that perhaps even when laptop was new the thermal paste was applied badly? Is there anything I can do besides cooling pad which I already have?\n\nI never intended to use it with super new releases but even League of Legends makes all the fans loud. Witcher 3 Wild Hunt even on lowest settings makes it go above 90C.\n\nFeel free to share opinions and experiences. I am just curious if it's normal or perhaps a lesson for the future that a cheap gaming laptop isn't a gaming laptop after all."

                "body": "Let me start with this - I absolutely hated season one. It was so wrong on many levels. Then a friend started watching season two and told me it starts very well so I watched it too. Four episodes in I thought - ok, if I forget this is an adaptation  then it's quite enjoyable. I was honestly and positively surprised how much I enjoyed it. I was ready to give it some good reviews despite of not being strictly truthful to the books at all, but then the rest happened...I lack words. I'm absolutely shocked how disrespectful this is to the author, to the books and the fanbase. I've never seen such an insult to the original material ever in my life. I'm in a total disbelief that someone has done it. There is absolutely not a single thing that isn't made up. Characters are completely different people to those in books and they only share the names. There is nothing from the books story wise. Absolutely zero. It's as if Harry Potter in The Order of Phoenix turned into a muggle, decided to transition and call himself Sherry, then moved to Syberia and lived selling chocolate pizza. Hissrich has completely outdone herself. This show is an insult to the books and to all those wonderful stories and characters I love. Why? Hissrich why are you doing this? Why couldn't you keep it low but still resembling the books? You've totally erased every identity and story. Why did you have to do this? I don't know what more is there to say. This post will be probably deleted anyway. Reddit is known for not allowing people to dislike something. So long live the fake positive image... For those of you who never read the books - go and read them. There is something much deeper and much more satisfying to experience.\n\nEDIT:\n1. It's really nice to see that I'm not alone with my opinion. I think it's important we voice our criticism. This was supposed to be an adaptation and while everyone can enjoy it, I don't think it's right or cool to just use original material as a mean of personal promotion and financial gain. After all, if you want to 'do your own thing' then by all means do so - write your own book. Don't ride on the back of someone's creativity and don't lie to the fanbase to lure them into this. Hissrich I am saying this to you since I am sure you are here in this Reddit. \n\n2. I will not hear anymore nonsense saying that the show was not supposed to be an adaptation or that no one said it would be truthful to the books. In fact, Hissrich herself has stated repeatedly that the show will be truthful to the books. Obviously a typical lie. This show isn't just 'retouched' here and there. It's a completely different story. There is a way of changing things without making the characters the opposite of what they are or something else all together. Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is just a prime example how to translate the soul of the books, keep characters authentic and yet have a completely new story that is coherent to the original material.\n\n3. It's just really sad to see that at this point, even if the showrunner miraculously changed (she will not), there is no way of bringing some stories back since they are overwritten forever now and characters are just different people.\n\n4. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me..."

He's the MAYOR, nobody cares that you're dating again.\n-He's let too many services fall into disrepair (e.g. the bus, the minecarts, the town's ground itself.)\n-THERE IS NO SCHOOL. Penny takes time out of her day to teach Jas and Vincent (w/o pay), and I don't want to know about the other young people in the village. The least he could do is get educational books for the kids\n-The farmer has to complete the museum/library by themselves, using things they find in the dirt.  \n-The town lacks a fire brigade and police, sure it's a small village, but crime(and fire) can still happen.\n- He wastes money on things like gold statues.\n-He is generally just not a good person.\n-I\n-HATE \n-MAYOR\n-LEWIS"

Anyways, I agree with all the other parts of the book people are bringing up in here that are unconfirmed/untrue, but something else I wanna mention is the whole thing about Kurt wanting to fire Krist and Dave all the time. I know Dave's mentioned it before, but he made it sound more like it was just something said during an argument or something. In the book it's treated like Kurt felt that way all the time and hated Krist and Dave. Courtney's said stuff about Kurt hating Dave too, but obviously she said a lot of stuff about Dave that wasn't true when her and Dave weren't getting along, so I wouldn't buy that either. Other than that, Charles is the only one I've ever really seen talk about them not liking each other and stuff.\n\nAnother thing is the whole royalty bit. Obviously, that did happen, and they all fought about it at the time, but again, Charles acts like it was something that permanently damaged their friendship or whatever, which I don't think is true. I remember reading an interview with Kurt from early 1994 where he says that his idea for it to retroactive was stupid, so I assume they at least got that mostly cleared up.\n\nCharles also makes it out like Kurt didn't get along with Steve Albini at all when they were recording In Utero, describing Kurt and Steve's relationship as a \"working relationship at best.\" It's been said almost everywhere else that Kurt said it was the best recording experience they ever had, so I don't buy Charles' take on that either.\n\nThat's all I can think of off the top of my head. If I think of more, I'll mention it. Overall, it was a good read, but not something to be taken as a \"definitive\" biography.",

I think they're viewing it differently than I am though. He's obviously really passionate about music, and that includes his own. I don't think he's trying to stroke his ego or whatever. Every artist can come off pretentious sometimes.\n\nAs for people's complains about the Foo Fighters, again, I see where they're coming from, but I view it different. The first 3 Foo Fighters albums are really good (they'd be perfect with a few songs taken off), they started getting a bit stale with One by One. All of their albums have some really good songs, but One by One and Echoes are very weak overall in comparison to their earlier records. In Your Honor is better, but it's still not the first 3 records for me. Wasting Light was really, really good though. I think it was the best album they ever did, but then with Sonic Highways it kinda went back to the typical Foo Fighters stuff. There's some good stuff on there, but nowhere near as good as Wasting Light. It's not bad. I basically see it as In Your Honor: Part 2. At the same time though, I never expected them to top Wasting Light or any of their other best records. It's stupid to expect a band to top their best stuff. Remember, lightning doesn't always strike twice, and it almost never strikes twice in a row.\n\nThe Foo Fighters are my second favorite band (behind Nirvana), but that's not because I think they're some groundbreaking band treading new ground or whatever. It has more to do with how much I like the music and what it means to me personally. I got into the Foos during a really bad time in my life and their music comforted me, so maybe that's why I like them more than other people, I don't know.",

I'm currently working on what will be my first complete novel right now, as a matter of fact. I understand that it's hard, but I'm willing to try and get better. I'm still young, so I have plenty of time. Only problem is, I don't read, and I've encountered so many posts on here talking about writers that don't read, and how it's nigh impossible to make it as one. As you would guess, it's getting me quite discouraged.\n\nI don't choose not to read because I don't think it's necessary, because I don't want to be \"influenced,\" nor any of the other common reasons thrown around here. I struggle with pretty terrible ADHD, and attention span is one of my worst areas. I struggle to do anything for more than maybe 15 minutes at a time, including reading. I try to get into it, but I just can't bring myself to do it. It just doesn't work out for me.\n\nSo that's what my question here is. Can I really be an author if I don't read? I know to any of you, it's really easy to say \"just push through it and read anyway,\" but to me, ADHD is really debilitating, and I really just can't make it work. Is it still possible to be a successful writer? Should I just give up? I know it's a difficult question to answer, because to me it seems like a pretty straightforward \"no\" to me, but I want to know if I'm missing something. Is there really nothing I can do here? I've wanted to be an author since I was in elementary school, but I can't tell if it's worth holding onto here.\n\n**Edit:** Just to clarify for those who don\u2019t know (because it\u2019s kind of buried under all the comments), I am not medicated and can\u2019t be for a while because I\u2019m under 18 and do not control my medical decisions at the moment, but I do plan to be eventually. I will try giving audiobooks/reading in smaller chunks a fry. Thank you for your replies, and I\u2019m sorry if I upset anyone."

I\u2019ve been to a few concerts before, but my friend (I\u2019ll call her K for simplicity) has been to way more than me. She told me she\u2019s been to this venue before, and it would get very loud, and recommended I get ear plugs. I don\u2019t own any, so she said we could pick some up on the way there. I wasn\u2019t particularly thrilled, since I\u2019ve been at the front of concerts before, and never had an issue with things being too loud. I told her I didn\u2019t feel I needed them, and she told me, \u201ctrust me, you\u2019ll need them.\u201d\n\nSo we agree to pick some up, and I\u2019m thinking \u201cwhat the hell, it\u2019ll probably be like $5, who cares. I\u2019ll just take them out if I don\u2019t like them.\u201d But then, we get to the place and she leads me to the ear plugs, and picks out the most expensive brand there, and the ear plugs would be $40. I told her directly, \u201cam I paying for all of that?\u201d and she replied we would split it. I was really hesitant because I didn\u2019t wanna blow $20 on something I didn\u2019t want. While at the music shop, K decides to look around at all the guitars (she plays guitar), and I try to talk to her about the cost multiple times, saying things like \u201cdo we really need the most expensive ones?\u201d, and I even told her directly \u201cif you want me to seriously pay half of this, I\u2019m not buying it.\u201d Every time I said something, she flat out ignored me or made a comment about a guitar.\n\nI kept trying to talk to her but she just walked right up to the register and put the plugs on the counter. I didn\u2019t wanna argue in front of this poor cashier just trying to do his job, so I just paid for them. We get back in the car and are on the way to the venue, and I\u2019m still salty as hell, because I really didn\u2019t want these earplugs, and now I\u2019m down $20 on them (which is a lot when you\u2019re unemployed, and I\u2019m far too busy to work right now).\n\nI take out the ear buds and try to put them in, but I realize they don\u2019t fit at all. They\u2019re way too big (K told me most people need the largest size, so I figured that would be me), and didn\u2019t stay in at all, and were super uncomfortable. Being ear plugs, they were also non-refundable. I told her this and she seemed disappointed, and then asked me, \u201cwell if they don\u2019t fit you, can I have them? I could use a nice pair like that.\u201d So, I begrudgingly give them to her, and that was that.\n\nThe concert was a few days ago, and I\u2019m still bummed out about it. I\u2019m thinking of asking her for the money back (the $20 of it I paid for, that is), since I both didn\u2019t want them and didn\u2019t use them. But, I don\u2019t want to be an asshole and start stuff over just $20, but I\u2019m really kinda pissed she didn\u2019t listen to me when I told her I didn\u2019t want to buy them. WIBTA? (Oh, and for those who were curious, no, my hearing was not damaged after the concert. Not even so much as a ring in my ears, I was fine)"

We're always flirting and teasing eachother in a playful manner but nothing beyond that. We're strictly just friends.\n\nNow, recently while we were talking about my ex-girlfriend, R asked if she was a dom. It was a long-distance relationship and it was a long time ago so we didnt do anything kinky. But it was obvious that she was the dominant one.\nAnyways, i said yes. And then R said that it was obvious since i really sounded like a sub.\nThen i asked how she knew; and she said that a dom can always recognize subs. This then triggered my curiosity and we talked about her experience with bdsm.\nApparently she had multiple online subs in the past but she tried to distance herself from domming a little over a year ago. She was kinda disgusted by it and was trying to *fix* herself. Though nothing worked. She's a natural dom and its the only thing that works for her.\nI did tell her that being a dom is awesome and that she should learn to accept herself and we kept on talking about how there's nothing wrong with her.\n\nNow here's the problem. I think i've developed a crush on her. She is quite beautiful but before knowing this i've never looked at her as anything more than a friend.\nThe thing is, we live in different cities (same country though) and i doubt we'll ever meet. Also I've had a bad experience with online dating so this isnt a viable option (though i'll settle for it if she does) Besides, this relationship will not lead anywhere.\n\nAnd now i dont know what to do. On one hand, i cant get it out of my head. On the other hand, i dont want to ruin our relationship.\n\nShe's so nice, hot and dominant. She has the whole package\n\nI am just so confused.

That's outright flirting.\n\nIf you're uncomfortable with the thought of having sex with him, especially since he has a girlfriend, tell him. Ask him what he really wants and tell him you don't want to come in between him and his gf because gurl, you really don't want to be caught between a cheating boyfriend and an aggrieved girlfriend.\n\nTell him outright that you don't want to be someone's secret. Now I know that is easier said than done, but you have to assert what you want and what you don't want. And expect that once everything's said and done, your relationship might change forever.",

It's because hyperblooms have the highest scaling among the transformative reactions.\n\nCyno is good for either teams if you build him with balanced artifacts. That is, you have at least 200-300 EM with still decent ATK/CR/CD stats.\n\nCyno with SoSS greatly allows you to balance his stats as its EM scaling is as good as having an ATK timepiece on him.",

Although, it was also Mare who helped restrain Albedo because of course, Eight Edged Assassin's (Stealth Build) strength alone isn't enough to hold a literal tank build.\n\n>\u201cPull her off Ainz-sama!

I\u2019d expect nothing less of the Guardian Overseer! Mare-sama, we request your aid!\u201d\u201c\u2500Awawa! O-okay!\u201dIn the end, Ainz was finally freed, ---\n\nVol 14;\n\n>She still hadn\u2019t forgotten the time they had ruined her chance and felt certain that they deserved to be scared at least a couple of times more. **On the other hand, she had already forgiven Mare for his part in the incident.**\n\nSo Mare already has brute strength capable of holding Albedo down *(not assuming that he is capable of bringing her down in the first place).*\n\nIcy bug boi dominates physically against both Shalltear and Albedo, and Aura is just a little bit lesser than Mare, still good though.\n\nWith that considered, Icey bug boi would hold back Shalltear with only a little bit of struggle.\n\nAura and Mare can restrain Albedo easily, and if more manpower is needed, Aura can summon beasts.\n\n\\--\n\nNow, if Albedo and Shalltear were to respond aggressively, with spells and counter-attacks.\n\nIcey boi would restrain Albedo instead.\n\n*(I remember in the light novel there was scissors-paper-rock phrase, Rock > Scissors > Paper = Icey Bug Boi > Albedo > Sebas)  So Icey Bug boi according to author can beat Albedo, and Albedo can beat Sebas and Seba can beat Icey Bug Boi.*\n\nSo while Icey bug boi is busy restraining Albedo, Aura and Mare can double-penetrate Shalltear. Shalltear is considered the strongest guardian, but 2 lvl 100 NPC vs 1 lvl 100 is pretty much Rule of Law who will win.\n\nIt can be argued that since Shalltear is higher battle quality that she could possibly win, but in situations like being outnumbered, as Punittie Moe says \"Use numbers to your advantage you fucking idiot!\" (he didnt' say that) it's clear who would be the winner. Shalltear only stands a chance if she had time to formulate some sort of strat, as Punittie Moe says \"If you're outnumbered, run, or fight smart\" (he didn't say that).\n\nBut it's clear she has ***no*** brain, so she physically, emotionally, religiously, ideologically, spiritually, considerably, in rule of constant relativity, astrologically, considerably and most reasonably cannot be **intelligent** enough to think of a strat against 2 lvl 100s on the spot especially while angry at Albedo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I promise i have rizz.",

Albedo wins.\n\nLong-game: Albedo will do her best to take down Demiurge, but he will try to flee and create some insane plans to bring Albedo down. Albedo will do the same but only if she fails to catch him, if she catches him then it's short-game.\n\nDemiurge can summon many types of monsters, but Albedo cannot. With his minions and some sort of immaculate plan, he *will* strategically destroy Albedo, or barely be able to. It will be 99% a mind game and whoever logically slips up loses immediately. Fall into one trap set by the other, and one of them is completely fucked. *In Volume 15 it's admitted by Albedo that compared to Demiurge, her military capabilities is inferior but her executive and administrative capabilities are superior.*\n\nIn the long game, the things going for Demiurge are of course his intellect (Albedo rivals it), along with his ability to summon minions and his superior military tactic capability compared to Albedo (who focuses on administrative and executive duties rather than military).\n\nI say that being able to summon minions is very much tilting the scale in Demiurge's favour here because of their unparalleled and flexible use in tactical and strategic plays that could be used against Albedo. The same point goes for the ability to cast a wide array of spells while Albedo is a Warrior-Tank based which = 0 flexibility when it comes to strats and tactics. SHe can only ooga booga hit and block while Demiurge has the freedom to create literal debussy art.\n\nWith those points in mind, and the fact that I'm sexist, it's clear Demiurge is the winner."

With his encouragement, I have entered competitions, and even placed first in a category in the UW-Whitewater Writing festival, having been the first freshman to attend from my school. I have entered my work into Scholastic\u2019s Art and Writing Contest, and even other various literary publications, both for youth, and not. I no longer fear failure. I have *talent*. \n\nHe lets me meet with him during office hours even just to talk about nothing, and he always has a new book, or movie, to recommend. I have even made a list of reasons as to why he is one of the best English teachers I have ever had.\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 \u25e6 \u2756 \u25e6\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 \n\nIt is as follows:\n\n1: he doesn\u2019t yell at or demean students; he tries to understand them instead\n\n2: he is always honest with work, and he acknowledges when something is outside of his prerogative\n\n3: he tries not to buy things from unethical sources; he thrifts most of his clothing\n\n4: he always shares the most interesting stories with us, both literal and fictional\n\n5: he fixed my bracelet when I accidentally broke it while meeting with him, and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer on the matter \n\n6: he doesn\u2019t let students say \u201csorry\u201d for having a genuine question, or meeting during office hours\n\n7: he\u2019s humble and kind; friends with everyone in his department. no one has a bad thing to say about him\n\n8: he makes every student feel special, and he always tells us how genuinely happy he is to see us\n\n9: he discusses the importance of recognizing the different subgroups that make up humanity, and how important it is for them to have equal footing; he challenges students who call feminism \u201cstupid\u201d\n\n10: he wrote me a personalized thank-you note that made me cry for the book I got him\n\n11: he\u2019s always supportive of his students, and pushes us to take opportunities we wouldn\u2019t have taken otherwise: when we do things on our own, he congratulates us warmly\n\n12: he\u2019s honest about the reality of our school, how we\u2019re pushed to take APs, how there are too many students in accelerated English (which he said isn\u2019t a bad thing, but that, now, college-prep English is the \u201clower class\u201d, and he wishes we would implement an Honors English) \u2014 and he talks to me like a colleague rather than someone lesser \n\n13: he likes using the word \u201cdelightful\u201d, and seems surprised and grateful when someone notices the little things (like when a student in my period talked about something he brought up the day prior)\n\n14: he genuinely and truly wants to teach us and watch us grow; he\u2019s involved in, and sponsors, two clubs\n\n15: he lets me walk into his office whenever I\u2019m bored, and we chat for about an hour before my actual classes start; he always has a new book to recommend\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 \u25e6 \u2756 \u25e6\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501 \n\nSo, to any teacher on this subreddit who pushes their students to go *try*, even if they fail \u2014 to the staff, in general, who want to see their students succeed \u2014 thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Even if your words don\u2019t reach every student who passes through your classroom, there are always a few whose lives are changed by your very actions. \n\n\n\n\n\nP.S. \nWith that said, I am extremely fortunate to go to my school; it is an affluent one, and I understand that not everyone can be as genuinely interested in their students as he is; \u201crockstar\u201d teachers called such by Admin (and society in general) for over-performing create more than a toxic work-environment. I will not feign understanding on the matter."

After killing her i went to a facehugger egg to kill myself and restart the speedrun(do do do do) but when i approached it the thing told me that what the girl said was heard and told me that it doesn't want to have unprotected naughties with me and so i said that it was overreacting and that alien never told me the pronouns before so i had to go by intuition. After a while the other facehuggers came and now we are divided 50/50 if it should forgive me. So Reddit, AITA?

Godzina 17, mieli\u015bmy by\u0107 ju\u017c w p\u00f3\u0142 drogi, kiedy ludzie zaczynaj\u0105 podawa\u0107 mi\u0119dzy sob\u0105 informacj\u0119, \u017ce trakcja przed Opolem zosta\u0142a zerwana i nie da si\u0119 przejecha\u0107. Naprawa potrwa pewnie do rana. Nikt w\u0142\u0105cznie z kierownikiem poci\u0105gu nie wie co i jak.\n\nPo kolejnych minutach dostajemy info \u017ce poci\u0105g b\u0119dzie skierowany na inn\u0105 tras\u0119 i ominie kilka stacji, ale w tym momencie jest kilkana\u015bcie sk\u0142ad\u00f3w kt\u00f3re czekaj\u0105 jak my przed nami. Wi\u0119c stoimy w poci\u0105gowej kolejce, ludzie sobie spaceruj\u0105 po dworze, bo w wagonach jest 40 stopni gor\u0105ca. \n\nPrzeje\u017cd\u017camy 5 min, stoimy 15 min. Morale w poci\u0105gu zaskakuj\u0105co wysokie, ludzie s\u0105 wkurwieni, ale tako sobie robi\u0105 podsmiechujki, no bo co zrobisz, nic nie zrobisz. Nawet transportu innego nie znajdziesz, bo pipidowa. Kilka os\u00f3b wysz\u0142o z poci\u0105gu i posz\u0142o szuka\u0107 szcz\u0119\u015bcia gdzie indziej. \n\n5h p\u00f3\u017aniej doje\u017cd\u017camy do Opola. Ludzie w mie\u015bcie s\u0105 straumatyzowani bo wszystkie poci\u0105gi zosta\u0142y odwo\u0142ane i nie ma jak si\u0119 wydosta\u0107 z miasta. Do Warszawy dotar\u0142am oko\u0142o 1.30. 311 min op\u00f3\u017anienia. Czy wspomnia\u0142am \u017ce wsta\u0142am tego dnia o 4.30? Zawloklam si\u0119 nocnym do domu i odsypiam. Najgorsza podr\u00f3\u017c poci\u0105giem w moim \u017cyciu.",

We were just like \"Haha this gives us alien eyes and bunny ears.\"\n\nI feel like this has changed over time. While my friends and I were laughing about having alien eyes in 2013, it seems as if people nowadays take those filters too serious. Sure people have been shopping themselves ever since that was possible, but I feel as if more people feel the need to hide \"imperfections\" by doing unrealistic edits. Could that be because photo editing is more accessible nowadays? \n\nAnyway, I feel sad that people feel the need to edit their selves for false confidence. It feels so much better to love yourself no matter what. Of course everyone feels insecure sometimes, but shopping yourself into oblivion doesn't solve anything. All that does is creating some fairytale alter ego. \n\nOh well thanks for listening to my TED Talk. I hope you have a nice day and feel happy about yourself."

                "body": "My mother's faith has been shaky for about a year, so she's been going from church to church, wholeheartedly believing everything the various churches teach. I try to strengthen her faith but she doesn't hear me. Now she's following a new church that's very different from the others. I won't name this church because I'm not here to tear anyone's church down, but they have teachings that stir up a sense in my spirit that something is off, a sense that truth is mixed with lies.\n\nI thought they were Christians like us, but after digging deeper, they claim Christianity has lost the work of the Holy Spirit and is essentially obsolete. They slander the Christian church, saying *all* pastors and elders are anti-Christs who serve Satan. They judge all of these people without knowing them or knowing their hearts and say these words are quite literally God's words, even *above* His words in the Bible. Similarly, they claim Paul never truly repented of his sins against the early church to say his writings in the Bible are deceptive. This doesn't sit right with me at all.\n\nThey also cast as much doubt on the Bible as they can. They flatly deny that the Bible is God's word, claiming it is full of empty words and empty doctrines despite claiming to believe God's and Christ's words in the Bible, which leads us to another point. They argue that the Bible contains both truth and lies. They deny the Trinity, contradicting God's and Christ's words in the Bible. They teach instead that God is the Father and the Father alone, and that God the Father came to Earth in the form of Jesus. They say \"there is no father-son relationship\" between the Father and Christ because it's only the Father. This teaching contradicts God saying, \"Let us make human beings in our image, to be like us,\" and, \"Come, let\u2019s go down and confuse the people with different languages,\" in Genesis. Was God the Father just talking to himself? This teaching also contradicts Jesus' own words. Jesus repeatedly calls God His father throughout the Gospels. Christ's words in Mark 13:32 also make it clear that the Father and Jesus are distinct beings.  \u201cHowever, no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen, not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself. Only the Father knows.\" Was Jesus then a liar? Was Jesus just praying to Himself in the garden of Gethsemane? Was He asking Himself, \"My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?\" I think we all know the answers to these questions. Other facets of this teaching make God seem almost arrogant, which makes my gut churn at the thought that they would characterize the Lord in this way.\n\nThey also say, not in so many words, that the name of Jesus has lost its power, which I know for myself is false. They say praying in His name affects no change and I know for myself that this is also false. They also devalue His sacrifice on the cross, which is unfathomable given that they call themselves Christians.\n\nOverall, this situation is unsettling, to say the least. I know I'm not sensing what I'm sensing for no good reason. Something about this church's teachings isn't right, and Mom's bought into all of it hook, line, and sinker. I'm really concerned. Every time this happens, she doesn't hear me or listen to me. Instead, she tries to coerce me into agreeing that it's all true. I know she'd try to tell me I'm an anti-Christ for sensing that something isn't right about this. I know only God can show her the truth of this matter. As such, I'm going to continue to trust Him and continue to pray for this situation since that's the only thing I know to do."

                "body": "So, as you can probably guess from the title of this post, I'm in a real situation. My mother, who taught me much about God, Jesus, and Christianity when I was growing up, has gotten herself involved in a sect of Christianity that embraces oppressive legalistic views to the point of making the Old Testament law an idol and even putting Jesus on the back burner despite claiming Him as their Lord, twists the New Testament to support these views, and speaks curses over other Christians by saying we don't worship the Almighty God and that we're going to Hell. So as Mom's gotten deeper into this belief system, I've noticed more and more that she's not loving her neighbor as herself, she has her sights set on the things of man rather than the things of God despite the fact that her focus on the law might make it outwardly seem otherwise to some, she talks about Jesus less and less, she's let herself get filled up with the same prideful attitude that breeds legalism and that legalism breeds\u2014the same prideful attitude Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for, she attempts repeatedly to make things about me taking sides and turn me against my Christian sisters and brothers, and she speaks repeatedly of works admitting someone into the Kingdom of God, having made the Old Testament law an idol to reduce the grace of God. So, as I've been doing my own research, I keep seeing that all of this is in direct contradiction to what Jesus taught and that she has the same legalistic attitude the New Testament warns against. The other day, I learned about how legalism comes from Satan, and with what's been happening here in the past month or so, I can really see it. My father, who also taught me much of what I know about God, Jesus, and the Faith, is the only other member of my family who sees what's going on here, and we both agree that it's not right and much of Mom's behavior doesn't come from God, though, unfortunately, we barely get any time to discuss this situation since Dad is constantly working. She's so focused on the legalism that she won't make the necessary changes where it really counts, which is on the inside. It's like she wants to hold on to this prideful, haughty attitude and look down on others. It's such that she won't listen to me or Dad, and if we disagree with a word she's saying, she wants to make it out like we just want to say it's okay to wallow in sin even though that's not the case. I've prayed for Mom to see that what she's following is false and, equally important, *why* it's false, but she's hardened her heart and can, in fact, be very abusive, using degrading language and emotional manipulation such as guilt-tripping and coercion, and it's like she's rejecting any and all attempts to free her from the lies she so desperately wants to believe. If I'm being completely honest, it feels like this is what Matthew 10:36 was talking about. So, what I'm wondering is, how should Dad and I proceed in this instance? The situation is very toxic here, and we can never get any peace."

He has no friends, honour or reputation left, and the only ones that will associate with him are death eater wannabes.\n\nWhen he comes home for summer after his fifth year at Hogwarts, he finds that his mother is dead and his father is missing. To top it all of, some two-hundred-year old contract between the Princes and the Blacks states that Severus has to marry Sirius Black before his 19th birthday.\n\nHe just cannot get a break, can he?\n\n[Severus Gets What Severus Wants\u2014Always](https://archiveofourown.org/works/31446923) (Completed)\n\nIt\u2019s been ten years since the defeat of Voldemort. Severus Snape has everything he wants in life\u2014a lucrative career, a prestigious reputation, a loving husband, and fun, albeit dramatic best friends. As he laid on his deathbed with his husband, Sirius Black, laying right beside him, he thought he would die content. This plan, however, is thwarted when Sirius confesses that he\u2019s had a crush on Severus since Hogwarts. Now, Severus is not content\u2014not even a bit. How could he be, when he knows they\u2019ve wasted so many years arguing and hating one another when they could\u2019ve fucked way back then?\n\n[Broken Me Found Broken You](https://archiveofourown.org/works/42772392) (Completed)\n\nIt\u2019s determined that Severus Snape and Sirius Black are immune to punishment after years of near-fatal pranks, bullying, and homemade curses. The only person who thinks them capable of ending the feud and finishing their education is Professor McGonagall. For the summer of \u201877, she gives them a pair of charmed hand mirrors and an ultimatum: communicate. That\u2019s it, a mere ten minutes every Saturday.\n\nBack at Hogwarts, when their animosity proves insurmountable, Sirius and Severus are relegated to a small, Eighth Year dormitory. The tight quarters\u2014wandless\u2014are intended to force them to make a peaceful reconciliation, but peace is impossible with a bloody war ramping up inside and outside the castle.\n\n[An Eternity of Black](https://archiveofourown.org/works/24580711) (Completed)\n\nIn a universe where the Ministry of Magic controls more about you, than you control about yourself. The Ministry of Magic assigns you a spouse and you're stuck with them whether you like it or not.\nSirius Black openly hated Severus Snape and was not shy about the fact that he loved his best friend. When Sirius Black is presented with a marriage summons he cannot ignore, he finds out the true definition of sleeping with the enemy.\n\n\u201cCan seven years of good memories make up for the seven years of bad ones?\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t get married because we wanted to,\u201d Snape says, \u201cWe got married because we had to,\u201d Snape says. \u201cYou can have your boy apologize to my son,\u201d Snape says firmly. Sirius watches Snape for a moment, trying not to grin, as he figures out what Snape was really saying, \u201cTell me,\u201d Sirius says, sitting down on Snape\u2019s lap. \u201cI know,\u201d Snape says looking back at Sirius, \u201cbut your side is outnumbered.\u201d Leaving the thin wizard on the ground unmasked, bleeding. \u201cI would die for our child, if it came down to it,\u201d Snape says firmly. There was no way in hell that Sirius had just admitted to giving him a love potion.\n\n[Eight-Twenty](https://archiveofourown.org/works/40173054) (Completed)\n\nThere's this... silly muggle theory.\n\nIn any romantic relationship no matter how perfect or healthy, you only get eighty percent of what you want and need. The problem for some, is that when you do encounter that last twenty percent you're not getting; it becomes incredibly tempting and the unwise man may leave that eighty percent thinking they're about to get a hundred only to be left with twenty. But sometimes, it can go the other way around. Sometimes you'll end up leaving twenty and end up with eighty.\n\nIn seventh year James left Severus for Lily. Best choice he could have ever made. It never would have worked out. Besides, he and Lily are married now, she's pregnant with his soon to be child and Severus...\n\nSeverus is with Sirius.\n\n[Rings And Ringing Bells](https://archiveofourown.org/works/40867653) (Ongoing)\n\n\u201cI always told myself that I would never end up like my mother, that I\u2019d never love a man that only knew how to drink his sorrows and hurt those around him. I wouldn\u2019t let myself bear these cuts and bruises for scraps of \u2018love\u2019 because I knew better. I thought I knew better.\u201d\n\nA bastardisation of a traditional love story. Two men both broken by the world are at wit\u2019s end trying not to kill each other. There\u2019s Severus, a bitter insult who does not take fools lightly, and Sirius, a drunkard who has a habit of pressing his buttons. It involves a curse which forces them to get married, an immaculate conception, and the blurring of the line between hate and love. They fear that they have no control over their lives and are doomed to make the mistakes their parents had done before them. They\u2019re not good for each other, but the fiasco that is their romance may be enough to teach them how to hate each other and themselves a little less. \n\n[Habit And Necessity](https://archiveofourown.org/works/42787902) (Completed)\n\nBound by a dark Black family spell, Severus and Sirius are trapped in a vicious cycle that neither of them can get out of, starting when they are both in Hogwarts and pulling them ever closer as they each edge close to death. Kind of like soulmates, but much nastier.\n\n[Walking The Monochrome](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1058100) (Completed)\n\nThat\u2019s what being a dog is like \u2013 it's like you\u2019re walking the very edge of the world, where almost all colour has run out, and you know that should you miss a step, you\u2019ll fall off that edge...

A letter from James finds him in Canada at an opportune time, asking him to come home to meet his soon-to-be-born son.\n\nRemus never expected that his time away would give him the perfect resume for teaching at Hogwarts, nor did he expect that his return would spark both conflict and resolution. If only he could get the Potion's Professor to understand how sorry he is for the way things turned out.\n\n\u201cWhat is the price for your forgiveness?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne Thousand Galleons.\u201d\n\n[Have Your Cake and Eat It](https://archiveofourown.org/works/26570062) by Cunegonde\n\nLying in hospital after the Battle of Hogwarts, Remus Lupin has a lovely lucid dream that he's gone back to his school days at Hogwarts. Only the day passes, then another, and another, and soon he must face the terrifying possibility that it isn't a dream \u2014 that he has irreparably altered the events of the past.\n\n[Fuel The Pyre Of Your Enemies](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27228712) by DivinityInMotion\n\nA paired class assignment for Astronomy incites a mutually beneficial agreement between Remus Lupin and Severus Snape.

Neither one is too happy with the arrangement at first.\n\n[Not Really Here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23431564) by OwlsWithFins\n\nAfter the werewolf prank, Severus disappears. He\u2019s still at Hogwarts\u2014at least, he thinks he is\u2014and he\u2019s probably still alive, but no one can see or hear him. Except for Lupin.\n\nRemus, meanwhile, is avoiding the other Marauders\u2014as well as everyone else\u2014and Snape becomes the sole exception to his self-appointed isolation.\n\nAs they work together to look for answers about Severus\u2019 condition, the unlikely pair drift toward friendship.

I was advised to spray my piercings with H2Ocean piercing spray, as well as to not sleep on them. Additionally, I was told to wait 6-8 weeks before changing jewelry.\n\nDuring those 6-8 weeks IIRC I needed to take out the right piercing because it was infected to the point of being unbearable. It was around month 3 when I could change jewelry for my left ear with no bloodshed.\n\nToday, almost 5 months later, I had to take out my left earring too, due to infection on a whole new level. On the \u2018inside\u2019 of my earlobe (past where the piercing was placed and closer to my face), there is now a huge, swollen, hot red mass. I applied a hot compress and plan on applying neosporin soon.\n\nI am, reasonably upset, but not necessarily surprised lol\u2026 I would love to get more piercings, but obviously after this shit show is healed and doing fine for a while.\n\nAny advice? I take it I should probably go to a different piercing shop next time, whenever that will be, after confirming that they have better quality jewelry. Or is this a situation where you guys would advise to maybe stick with no piercings at all? \ud83e\udd72"

They'd be like a miniature science nexus. (Repeatable up to 4 times)\n\nAlso, asteroid artillery would really be neat to have. (Slightly scaled down on attack power, but not too much)\n\nAsteroid consumer goods factory. (Repeatable if it gives 100 consumer goods instead of 250, costs like 8000 alloys to build)\n\nAnd... maybe scaling on structures. If a star is bigger, it produces more energy on the dyson sphere, but costs more alloys and time to build. It just makes sense. On B types you get like 10k energy at the cost of.... well. 40 years of constructuion at least on a 50k total alloys, maybe more. But it's 10k energy per month.\n\nConflicted on neutron star alloy forge (the smaller one, not the nidavellir kind) (not repeatable, although it would make sense to be repeatable, costs quite a lot but it gives 300 alloys, I think)\n\nAlso, the crystal mining laser. But maybe a little bit scaled down, instead of 50 rare crystals, you'd get like 10 (it costs ~10.000 alloys to build, repeatable)\n\nAnd just maybe the planetary computer. Kind of like a research ecumenopolis, but it's either the miniature science nexus I mentioned first or this. Also you can't make it on any planet you want, it has to be habitable.\n\nTalking about uninhabitable planets. Why can't we colonise them? They could make them be a lot weaker than normal habitable planets, like say you could colonise a barren planet that acts kind of like a habitat, has 6 building slots. Say you could make a small mining outpost. We can build literal habitats, miniature planets in space yet we can't colonise a rock?",

                "body": "So as the flair suggests, I had this idea while on the sh*ter.\n\nMain reason why people can enslave villagers is because it's just so simple, they offer no resistence, express no other activity other than walking around, sometimes harvesting crops, sometimes making sounds. We all know that.\n\nI was thinking that, if Mojang really wants to stop villager slavery, a good idea for an update is to give them life. One first easy thing they could do is make the armorer and cleric be able to build more golems. If scared, an armorer and cleric would have to be close to eachother in order to spawn a golem. The armorer would place the iron blocks and the cleric - the pumpkin. Also, if the armorer can reach the golem, and if the golem is damaged, then he would ba able to repair it.\n\nAnother idea would be to make villagers able to rebuild their villages if destroyed. This could work like so - In a naturally spawned village, the villager should know which blocks are the village and in case they're broken, the villager would attempt to replace them, exept when they're under threats, at night, or in a raid. Villagers that were brought back from being zombies wouldn't be able to fix a village. (Normally  I think they should as well, but I have no idea how to implememt this other than a more complicated way, like manually giving a work station a definite area where they can rebuild.)\n\nVillagers would also need recreation time. Like the need for socialisation, just being in the presence of other villagers should be enough, and green space with open skies. If this need is not met, they would trade for less or even lose experience. I think this should be easier to implement.\n\nAlso, predefined work hours, where they would stay near their work station and not move around aimlessly. This is really one of the main reasons why trading halls exist. Villagers move around aimlessly without real work hours and are just hard to find. Trade halls offer an easy way to access villagers.\n\nThe need for intimacy when asleep. They need bedrooms, same mechanics as in the need for recreation, but with less negatives of intimacy isn't provides, like maybe not as much experience loss. But if they aren't allowed to sleep, at some point they would pass out. And maybe even die if repeated.\n\nNow, talking about accessing villagers again... villages need a marketplace. During work hours, around the afternoon, villagers would gather around the village bell and just spend time around it. Ideally in separate market stalls if possible, this would unlock the idea of offers. Discounts, etc.\n\nNow, talking about being thankfull. If a village is destroyed, and you help rebuild it, or kill zombies and skelletons outside at night or if they do not have a recreation space, parks, and you provide them a park, then you'd get discounts. \n\nA park would be easier to implement if we'd have a specific block for it. Like a chair, can combine like a chest to make a bench. These, together with greenery and open skies, and other villagers around to interact with, would give them that recreation bonus, which boosts xp generation and can offer you discounts if you made it.\n\nA neat addition would really be to take inspiration from other games like sims, cult of the lamb, where people talk gibberish, but you can still guess what they're talking about by having picture bubbles above their heads. Ok cult of the lamb has some text too, but that is for specific requests.\n\nTl;dr: If Mojang wants to stop villager trading halls, they could by updating villagers to have needs like recreation, real need for sleep, socialisation, having more civic activities like repairing broken buildings or actively building iron golems. They would be thankful to you if you'd provide them these benefits and even show you trade offers or discounts."

I'm Taurus/Cancer/Scorpio (24) woman, we had been closest friends for more than 1 year. I had a strange feeling for him, the feeling that I had never experienced with other people. Its like the soul connection felt so extraordinary though he has a short temperament. (Probably because Pisces most compatible is with Taurus, Cancer, Scorpio and I happened to have those big threes). Everybody in our circles knew that we stick like a glue towards each other and always thought that we're in a relationship, but he always lied to his friends that I was his gf when I wasn't around with him that time and always behaved like he owned me when I was around him. One day later, he said to me that he loved me and told me that I was the first woman who made him desire for love again after such a long time. I actually felt the same way for him but I didn't return his love bc he happened to be in another country for work and I don't trust LDR. He sensed I didn't return his love and 1-2 months later he had a new gf lol. That means he had been chasing another woman beside me and his new gf is the second option right? And he was proudly showing off to us, especially me, that he's had a new girl. The thing is after he got a new gf, he suddenly contacted me. He missed me as friends as we used to be, and I tried to open again to him after he said that. But when I was with him again I still sensed that he acted like he owned me when he has a gf and it made me feel disgusted. I didnt really contact him anymore, but he was always the one who contacted me first, told me he wanted to see me in 2023. I felt bad for his gf and when he contacted me again I lied to him I had a bf already and I said I want to keep my heart for my bf so dont contact me when its not necesarry. Then it worked, he really stopped contacting me again. I didnt fully lie, I had a new bf after I said that. My new bf was a Sagittarius, the thing is I've fallen for him but I didn't feel the soul connection like I had with this Pisces man."

I recommend doing cardio after a weightlifting session.\n\n- Spend time with friends, bring up the breakup once or twice but don\u2019t keep talking about it. If you need someone to talk to all the time get a therapist.\n\n- Don\u2019t slack on work, I know it s hard and you barely have motivation but don\u2019t let someone from the past heavily affect ur future.

Anyways, we casually chatted for a couple of days but it didn\u2019t go long before she started talking about AIMI tokens with expected 50-80% results in three months. After that she casually dropped the offer to invest with her and subsequently started triggering red flag after red flag. Yeah, not likely to fall for that but now I have her number. I do have a large following on some financial advice chanels and want to warn people about this operation, is there a way to use her number to backtrace the operation?"

But recently I've been told that referring to someone as \"a/the female\" sounds really, really bad. I never mean it in a misogynistic way, and I do the same thing for guys, but apparently it comes across in an unintended way.  \n\n\nSo now whenever I wish to refer to a female friend of mine, I feel unsure of what to call them. I know I technically gave an answer in the question: I can call them a woman. But I'm in my early 20s, and calling someone my age a woman just sounds too... mature, I suppose? Same with saying Lady. I mean, I certainly don't feel like an adult yet, so it is odd to refer to my goofy friends in such an adult manner. Is that ridiculous? Should I just accept that we are adults and use woman/lady?  \n\n\nThe word Guy is much easier to use, as it doesn't have the same mature connotation. Is there a good equivalent to use? Someone suggested the word Gal, but I have never heard that used in my life, so I am unsure if I should seriously consider it."

                "body": "\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\nI am a 21 year old male with the maturity level of a particularly silly 8 year old. I have a very active imagination and am frequently creating things in my mind and placing them into the world around me. Who needs actual friends when you can just imagine some delightful company?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nThere is indeed! I have social anxiety, which often makes me regret associating with humans after the fact. Because of this, I am often alone, which makes it confusing to know if I am an introvert or merely an anxious extrovert.  I adore being in the centre of attention, however, and when everyone around is paying attention to me, my anxiety can sometimes even go away. I also have very bad ADHD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nI grew up religious - Jewish, to be specific. Because of this, I was unable to use any electronics or draw every Saturday. Due to my ADHD, this was incredibly painful for me, so I eventually ceased to be religious. My parents were understanding and let me choose my own path. I also just find religion a bit silly in general. That is not to say that it is not true, because I hardly have any way to disprove the existence of god, and I think that religion is great for the people that it makes happy; but to me, I've always believed more in what science has found, and felt that religious people were basically discussing fairies with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI do not have a career, and I do not really wish to get one. I like having fun and being silly with my time! The idea of having a career and being unable to do what I want sounds terribly dreadful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nI'd have a blast. I'd dance to music, watch shows, maybe sword fight some imaginary people. It is possible that I'd feel lonely, but most likely I'd just be having fun.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI am dreadful at sports, and I prefer being home watching a show, but I do love moving around and dancing and climbing things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nOh yes, I am very curious. I will walk around and see, say, a sprinkler, and think, \"How does that work?\" I will then ask people, and if they don't know, I will find anyone around (such as random strangers) and ask them until someone can explain the science behind it. Also, when talking with others, I'd often bring up ridiculous random curiosities that come to mind, such as whether it is rape to have sex with your sleeping clone, and I will argue my thoughts and try to make everyone present share their opinions so that we can bounce answers off each other until we find an answer that I feel most accurately answers the question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI am good at getting people to do what I want, but I would not wish to be a leader. I do not care for the responsibility that would entail. But I am skilled at manipulating the situation in order to convince people to do whatever it is that I want them to do. Rather than being a leader, I'd be better off flirting with the actual leader and making them do what I want, without needing to deal with any of the hardships that being an actual leader would require.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nI am not coordinated. Like I've mentioned before, I am terrible at sports. But I love fiddling with things, and when I was little I'd always take things apart and try putting them back together better than how I found it. I haven't done that in years, though. I also used to always enjoy finding random things lying around and making little \"inventions\", which basically meant I'd attach random things together and turn them into something I found cool. I'd still find that fun to do, I just have been doing other things lately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI enjoy drawing and writing books. Writing books is great because I love creating new characters and all their details and situations for them to be in. I entirely lack the ability to find things beautiful, however, so paintings and poems mean nothing to me and I find them very pointless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nI really only live in the present. I completely lack the ability to think about the future, which causes me some problems, as I have no motivation to do important things like making enough money to survive. As for the past, the only time I think about it is due to my anxiety making me regret what I did when around others, but I never think about it apart from that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIf I help, it is because I know that in theory I probably should in order to not seem like a terrible person. I gain no joy from helping others, and I will often just not help. When I try to help, I often am not responsible enough to complete the task and make people regret having ever asked for my help. Which works in my favour, really, because I did not wish to help in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nWell, they are great and all, but to me it is more about having fun whilst I'm doing it. If I enjoy something, I will be productive. Otherwise, I will likely not be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nYes. When I was younger, if I saw a candy I wanted, I would say that I've never tried it before so that someone would offer it to me to try. I manipulate people like this often. I enjoy getting things I want, and people are easy to control into giving me this. I also just find it fun to mess with people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI've mentioned these before, but my hobbies include dancing around and imagining things. When I put on music and dance around, I can tune out the world around me and go in a bubble where nothing bothers me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI am terrible with memorisation, so I definitely struggle with that. I enjoy classes that involve creativity, but I excel with classes like maths and physics. Actually, I also do well in classes with creativity, I just do them less because my family thinks that I should do what will more reliably get me a high paying job. Really, I just do well in things that involve learning in general. I hate school, though, so I spent much of my life being homeschooled. School is far too dull for me, and I never learn anything from the teachers. I must learn everything on my own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nEr. I don't know. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I'm writing a book now, and I wrote out an entire outline before I started. I still do improvise for parts, but I had the main structure laid out for me from the start.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nReally, I just want to have fun.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI suppose I fear the idea of my mother dying, because she helps me with everything that I have trouble with. (And let me just tell you, I have trouble with a lot.) I do not really hate things, but I will think less of someone if they do not fact check.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nWhen I'm just having fun! Most of my life is a high. I have a pretty gosh darn brilliant life. As previously mentioned, I love being the centre of attention, so I gain a great deal of joy when everyone's eyes are on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nBeing in school, not getting enough sleep, constantly surrounded by people making my anxiety terrible. I love being around people when I'm the centre of attention, but when I'm not is when the anxiety gets bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI go on walks often, and when I am walking, I think about something and tune everything else out. For example, when I was first writing my book, I would think for hours as I walked about what should happen in the book. I am aware enough to watch out for cars, though, I think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nWell, luckily for me, there is never nothing to do when you have a ridiculously active imagination. I'd just visualise some people there with me or pretend to have superpowers or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nI'm terrible at making decisions, and my solution is to ask other people what to do so I do not need to think about it. Really, when I order food I just say \"Give me whatever you want.\" and eat what I get.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nThe only emotion I enjoy is happiness. I'd gladly get rid of all other emotions. My way of dealing with negative emotions is just to tune them out and listen to funny music or watch a distracting show or anything that removes the emotion for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nI'm not argumentative at all, so if people disagree with something I say, I just assume they know more about the topic than I do and say that they are probably right. That is, unless the topic is about something entirely ridiculous, in which case, I will argue my side intensely until they admit their defeat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nI never break rules. It isn't like I feel like rules are important or anything, I just see no reason to break them. I had no rules growing up, and as such, I've never had the ability to be a rebel if I wanted to, so I've never had a desire to break rules just for the sake of going against authority. Whenever I do something that is technically against the rules, I ask my parents for their advice first, so I basically get permission from them. I don't think that authority knows better, though. I just think that my parents know better, because I trust their judgement, so I only go against rules if they have a good argument for why I should. I am generally a very well behaved lad, and adults have always loved me for this."

So the question is this: Do you thinks it\u2019s more worth it to play the Prime Trilogy or all 3 games separately now or do you think one should wait for an eventual remastered version or a collection for the Switch? Do you think there will even be one, considering the rumours? If they release a collection there will probably be changes in controls like they did for Skyward Sword HD, would that option be something worth waiting for? The current price of the Prime games shouldn\u2019t be ignored either. I\u2018d turn this into a poll, but since those aren\u2019t allowed\u2026"

I think her face looks slightly stylized and that helps keep her above the uncanny valley imo. I really like her face, it has a lot of appeal. \n\nWhat I am missing is hair. More peach fuzz in her face, some hair on her toes and legs. To be fair the skin looks so good you don't need peach fuzz for it to look convincing, but without those small hairs everywhere the skin appears a tiny bit waxy. At least up close. Peach fuzz really sells realistic skin imo. But again, it's literally just a nitpick because this is so good already there's not much to say. \n\nI'm excited to see what you post next!",

Especially starting deep talks way too late and talking *at* my boyfriend instead of to him. I have huge regulation issues because I've got ADHD, but it's something I consciously work on because if I don't then the relationship suffers. \n\nWhat I did to solve it was sit my boyfriend down and talk to him about *why* I felt the need to start talkig about heavy stuff at inappropriate times. It was because he kept himself busy all day (work and then just gaming all night) and I felt the only time I could genuinely connect with him was at bedtime because he could dedicate his focus to me. \n\nHe said he was tired after work and gaming is his way of recharging. I respect that, but he also understood that he should make an effort to connect with me when he felt he had the capacity. \n\nThe only times I talk at people is if I accidentally get too excited about something and start rambling, but I am self aware enough to know I should be shutting up. It's just a hard impulse to control sometimes. If I do talk at my boyfriend now, he'll let me know he can't keep taking in the information I'm giving him and I need to take a break. So that's what I have been doing for the past few years. No late, intrusive talks - limited taking at, haha. \n\nThese are just things you learn in a relationship, though. You need to adapt to the other person, or there's little point in being together. \n\nBut what helped me stop the most was hearing how it made my boyfriend feel. It also helped that he was considerate of my feelings and wanting to find a solution. Luckily the one that addressed this issue with me I had very good communication with throughout the relationship. \n\nThe communication issues I am referring to in my previous comment were mostly guys who literally would not talk to me. After getting to know each other was out of the way, it just became increasingly hard to interact with - let alone have a healthy relationship with. \n\nBut here I am rambling myself, haha. Sorry for the long reply, but you do bring up some very good points because I think over communication definitely is an overlooked issue.",

So how do you sustain infinite growth when you only have finite resources? By controlling as many resources as possible and manipulating either the consumer, the market, or both to distribute these resources. As a result the system encourages the accumulation of power. The more resources and consumers you can influence, the more power you'll get. And you know what they say; absolute power corrupts absolutely. This is precisely *why* it's so important to strictly regulate capitalism in order for it to work optimally. \n\nSo I don't see how cronyism is anti-capitalistic. The accumulation and hoarding of power and wealth Erdogan and his friends are doing is a symptom of poorly regulated capitalism.",

If he did talk about anything that he found challenging, he'd just get angry and frustrated and we'd end up fighting. \n\n- Me being called too emotional or annoying for wanting to talk about feelings and reflect upon the relationship. \n\n- Him not communicating when something I did wasn't okay and instead of confronting me he just quietly let resentment build over time until it started tainting the relationship. \n\n- Him zoning out or getting really sleepy every time I try to communicate something complex or how *I'm* feeling.\n\nMan, I could go on for ages. Of course I've not always been a good partner either, but communication has never been my problem. It's always been my boyfriend's problem.\n\nEdit: grammar",

It's directed at immigrants, black people, liberals, republicans, communism, straight men, atheists, Muslims, angry women, medical masks, Karens, big Pharma, trans people... etc. We fear our neighbours now and we side eye them instead.

I am double vaxxed but haven't had the chance to get the booster since I've gotten sick each time. \n\nAnyway - this is the point. I was more or less recovered after my second infection. I only had a mild persisten sore throat but that's it. \n\n2 weeks after I had no more symptoms except for the sore throat, I decided to work out (1 month after the reinfection). I only took a walk, but that walk lasted too long and I ended up exhausted. \n\nAfter I woke up the next day I was hit with crazy heart palpitations, brain fog and exhaustion. During the night I all of a sudden went numb in my left arm and leg. The following days I got hives, fever and I lost blood circulation in my fingers and toes (they literally turned blue). \n\nI don't want to drag this post out, but I'm still struggling with long haul although I've slowly gotten better. Part of me wonders if I could have prevented it completely if I hadn't exhausted myself so soon after the infection. \n\nI know people say to take it slow with the exercise when you're recovering but just a long ass walk did it for me. So *please, please* be careful and don't exhaust yourself whatever you do when you're recovering. I wish someone had told me to treat it like a really bad mono infection."

And I suppose I understand the precaution, but I still don\u2019t like it.\n\nWhy is it that one of the few games I want to play says no you can\u2019t play?  Master Chief Collection, more like Master Chef Connection.  Ya it\u2019s small compared to other things to complain about, but I\u2019m a simple man.

Ideally, you call me a dumbass who obviously doesn\u2019t have OSDD/DID.\n\nFYI I have anxiety which makes me have irrational thoughts. I have a tendency to read into normal things and view them as abnormal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I have very blurry memories of the days that go by. I have to go step by step through the day to remember. Often, I have memories where I know I did the action, but not an exact idea of when, or I feel like it isn\u2019t exactly me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I don\u2019t know whether or not I have trauma. My parents were unpredictable growing up, I was hit a lot, but I don\u2019t register is as very traumatic but when I was young I was pretty scared. I think at some point I was worried my mum was going to kill me after being yelled at after a ballet class so I called my dad in another town. My mother also berated me, compared to me other people - especially in my netball team. But this is just the average European family. I have experienced disasscioative symptoms from it (DPDR), but I really don\u2019t feel like that trauma was enough for my mind to to seperate into alters(?). I don\u2019t feel any gaps in my memory throughout my life. My older sisters can\u2019t remember anything outrightly horrible happening to me, or abnormal behaviour suggesting trauma. But I was told I was a miserable baby/toddler. Sometimes I feel a lot of pain for my childhood, and sometimes(normally) I don\u2019t gaf and move on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Some days, I go from being very loud to very irritable and quiet. And, I, a British-New Zealander fluctuate between the accents and play into a certain personality because I have an unsure grip of my identity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* My opinions can change very rapidly. Along with how I interpret life (somedays I feel romantic academic, or I feel really rugged and fuck it.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I have never ever had people point our discrepancies in the way I behave; at lest abnormally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I can feel like different people. Tied into earlier, but I am not sure if that is a personal identity issue. Anxiety\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I have no physical symptoms; nor do I heavily disassociate (to my knowledge\u2026)\n* I feel blurry looking at stuff I have drawn/written. I feel suprised like \"wow,,,, I did that?!\" or when my phone broke, it felt unreal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I heard voices in my head 3 times. Except they were more like thoughts that thought for themselves; I couldn't hear them like auditory hallucinations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I was having a very bad derealization day; felt unreal amounts of anxiety. and I got into my car. I disassociated for 3 or so minutes and as I \u201asnapped out of it\u2019 I heard some bitch say \u201eI am Cara. I am here to help you.\u201c I was like hell naw!!!! I don\u2019t have DID stop!!!! And nothing came of it. I didn\u2019t retrieve any memories, or feel like a different person. Just eerily calm.\n2. I was going to sleep and I had a back and fourth with someone in my head.\n3. I was going to sleep(or disassociated\u2026 Can\u2019t remember. Maybe both? I was in bed at night.) and I had an outsider thought of \u201eOP, huh. What an odd one. She seems like she\u2019s there and sometimes she isn\u2019t, sometimes\u201c. I immediately woke up and was like \u201eermmm wtf is this\u201c.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt my worse depersonlization/derealizaiton time of my life, in an intense traumatic week (see 1.) I was vastly unpredicatable. For two days, I felt like a little girl (without the mannerisms with one. I did not have a voice change, but my internal monologue occasionally had a \"I want mommy\" (cringe, i know.) and mad seperation anxiety from my parents. which i never had ever before, not even in kindegarten. this lasted 1-2 days after INTENSE anxiety. I cant tell if this was a character break, or an anxiety response, but not an altar. I have perfect memory of it, and didn't go by a different name. Another time, was afterschool I Felt a weird consciousness/feeling which I only ever felt when i was 12ish. i didnt behave like how i was 12 tho\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am seeing a pysc. She explained to me that maybe my emotions aren't in harmony, and r disconnected or some shit like that and made me name the 3. guy (i called him observer.) and see if i needed to bring harmony by doing shit. i cant talk to it, at all lmfao.... after i got out i think i placebo'd talking to him and pretended he was in my mind for comfor which is some endo shit if u ask me. but i felt like a different person, however not with goals just disconnected from the world. I don't know if shes suggesting DID, but hems making me do snadtray therapy or some dumb shit like that"

I have adjusted to all changes. \n\nThis one started due to a panic attack, summer month, and anxiety. I had a shorter episode last January after not eating and I was borderline delusional and thought the FBI was after me for a day and accused my friends of being feds(lmao). It got better after grounding and eating food.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll recover. I always had, when I was younger, but I don\u2019t know about now. \n\nAny hopeful comments, advice, or tips?

I am in southern hemisphere so flip the seasons\n\nIt started with my ears being blocked from swimming. I think this freaked me out, and I got triggered into an episode. Now, I haven't experienced this in months.\n\nI have had episodes since I was 9. In fact, I originally depicted DPDR as a wistful and beautiful mood, where I could recount and review on the world as a bystander. I romanticized the HELL out of it. I experienced a lot, or for a long time. I don't remember. I got through these very peacefully, as you could imagine.\n\nI had shorter episodes I got through recently. My first self aware (?) episode is when I was drawing and was like \"this is better than usual. what if I'm not real because this doesn't look like my art. \\*looks in the mirror.\\* AM I REAL?\"\n\nI should have gone to sleep.\n\nAnyways, I always experience episodes in the summertime. I don't know why. In fact, I have a personal \"phenomena\" where every summer I expect \"the feeling\" to come.\n\nJanuary sucked, and I was suicidal. Playing games was my relief. I stayed at home. It got a lot better. Like, if it weren't for me obsessing over it, I would have recovered. But February... I got into an existential crisis and into a toxic relationship.\n\nI am not going to bore you with the details. But I had so many thoughts and paranoias. My worst two was: How would I know if I recovered? If I don't think about my DPDR 24/7, then am I in a disassociated state? (UGHHH)\n\nThen that relationship with a 21m guy online because I needed emotional support. He fucked me up. I was scared he wanted to fly over and kidnap me (he made such plans...) so I can't remember a lot of February. Idk why. Noting interesting happened, probably. I can't remember how bad it was. It blurred together.\n\nNow march. I spent the first half crying about my childhood when in reality, I might have been a sad child, back in the day I literally didn't give a shit. I dropped the victim mentality asap.\n\nTo identify triggers and points of interest:\n\nTriggers:\n\n* Going/sleeping at friend's houses\n* Extensional thoughts/death\n* Going on holidays/leaving town\n* my future\n* ANXIETY/DEPRESSION. BIG ONE.\n* NOT EATING. THIS IS MY BIGGEST ONE I SWEAR\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRetired triggers!! YAY!!!!\n\n* MATRIX!!!! im so happy to get over this one\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut i think im getting better. like i feel more myself everyday now. i am not sure how long it will take. but i am willing to wait. i am getting used to it, and finding more peace. most of my symptoms despite visual impairment are gone (but i feel melancholic often.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni am pretty sure, my dpdr is no where as severe as most. i dont get any of the worst symptoms anymore. i can feel emotion and i feel like myself. It's just reality looks fucking weird and it annoys me. i swear if i became blind i would recover IMMEDIATELY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut in all honesty... if i recover, then these months of dpdr will have scarred me. i have spent these last few months with chronic anxiety every day. i dont think ill ever be the same"

I don't wanna go too much into detail and I'm not even sure if what I am describing is trauma, let alone PTSD, but I figured out that this would be the community where people will get what I mean. Three years ago I started having unusual psychological symptoms and rushed to the doctor. Since then, it's been a rollercoaster of million diagnoses, bad therapy and zero understanding. The symptoms got very harsh and after some time I suffered so much that I started wishing for returning to my past pre-ilness self, but that is impossible obviously. I've been dealing with shame, guilt, and lack of connection to others for a really long time. It has abused my sleeping pattern, I started overeating and overall diagnosed with depression. No one of course got me as the symptoms I exhibited did not fit any criteria. Any! I had to repress my feelings and not talk about them, which led me to my sad self today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I am done and I no longer want to connect with therapists to try to help me. I know that because my symptoms are so weird I am the only person who can get through that and no one will understand. The thing is that as I am alone in this, I don't really know how. Death? Millions of advice online. Loss of a job? Same. I feel like what I call \"ego loss\" is not often discussed as trauma and grief and I don't know what to do to forgive myself. And stop wishing to go back in time. I thought about getting a memorial tattoo in which I hold my past self (one in color and one black and white to show how I'm feeling) or writing a letter to myself. I am very lost and need advice on how to navigate something that people don't think exists."

Anyone got any recommendations for similar albums? I really like it when the lyrics seem somehow poetic and the different sings make a story"

I get a text from someone other than her maybe once in two days while me and my girlfriend chat a lot every day. \n\n*She often says that I\u00b4m the only person she has and truly cares about but when I see the way they talk to each other, I always find it hard to believe.* *I have no one except her, not even family.* \n\nSometimes I wish I could also have someone other than her to make myself feel better or make her at least little bit jealous and make me feel a bit more \" on demand \" \n\nWhat should I do?"

This triggers the fear of abandonment less. It makes me feel less s\\^icidal and other things. Makes me relapse less. It's just really helpful. My NPD also needs people to set up their boundaries, because it helps me understand how I can be the best friend or right friend for a person. What can I do? What can I do to empower myself? Setting up my boundaries with others, learning what is reasonable for myself and others, etc. Having other people do their part in a relationship is necessary in any relationship. Setting up boundaries REALLY helps. That's all there is to it.",

I am SUPER romance repulsed and do not like it when people talk about (their) romance around me or romance that is revolved around me. I feel deeply disgusted at the idea of being in a romantic relationship with anyone of any gender. I feel deeply disgusted when people talk about romance all the time around me, to the point I can only talk about romance on my own terms (aka when referring to my fictional characters and their romantic relationships, ships, etc.). I often times forget romance even exists when reading books, watching movies, playing/watching games, and watching shows. I hate seeing romance just pop up randomly, and it feels like it was just unnaturally tacked on to it. It gives such HIGH anxiety when I am listening to people talking about their romantic problems and issues. I feel so detached from romance and alloromantics. I always feel like I'm absolutely observant and anti-romance when I see others around me coming to me for relationship advice. I hate that I give absolutely amazing and good and helpful tips on romantic relationships, when I'm not even INTO it or other ppl that way. The idea of me being in a romantic relationship of any kind, makes my lungs hurt and makes me feel trapped, chained, and stuck. I have three queerplatonic partners, but lately I've been imagining myself NOT wanting to live with anyone in the future but me and my little future pet bird.  \n\n\n I sometimes just wish I could be alone forever and I hate the idea of chaining myself to others. I feel like romance is so toxic and the concept makes me feel like p\\*king. I have a lot of trauma with amatonormativity and I just don't want to feel so alone. I used to have really bad internalized arophobia. And I am so sick and tired of everyone always talking about romance. It feels so alienating and brings me so much anxiety. I love my qpps btw and I do plan on living with them in the future, but I just don't want to get TOO attached. I just want to be free, independent, and not have anyone try to force me into a bubble.  I don't wanna be \"half of a whole\". I already AM whole. My identity and independence and autonomy or too fucking important to me. Why do I have so much anxiety at the idea of being with someone and chaining myself to them? It's so ironic bc I have abandonment issues, get attached easily, want to form deep and emotional connections and bonds, am very loyal, and can get clingy (I'm working on this). Is there something wrong with me????"

They concentrate on solving integrals with more tools\nAnother book that i can suggest is Calculus Early Transcendentals by Edwards, penny, henry c. and david e,\nAs a person who self studied calculus I think these books can be a fascinating introduction to calculus and are perfectly enough for uni entrance\nBTW when is your exam?

They don't speak with each other I don't know why but, even if my mom knows it stresses me out, they talk to each other through me. It's my dad's fault more than my mom's but okay. \n\n\nAlso, we live very far away from our dad, and we (me and my sibling) only see him three times a year. \nMy dad has a wife and other kids and we get along pretty good most of the time. \n\n\nMy dad called me yesterday to talk about the holidays and he was telling me how bad covid it's getting there and how we wouldn't be able to see our step-siblings since their house is too small for the seven of us (we wouldn't live with them but we could see them). That's bullshit but I know where he's coming from. Last Christmas we spent the holidays there and he didn't do any chores. His wife had to clean and cook and at the end of the holidays she was upset about it, since my sibling and I are not her kids and I understand it.\n\n\nHe was telling us how bad it was going to be so we wouldn't go this year. I mean, I get it, but he could have been open about it. I literally asked him if he prefered us not going and he was like no, I want you to come blabla BUT it's going to suck for you. \n\n\nMeanwhile, my mom hears the conversation and comes into my room and starts making gestures trying to tell me that I should say that we don't want to go and I felt a lot of pressure from both sides.\nMy mom doesn't want us to go because she has to pay the tickets and she can't afford it. She's pretty scared of covid, too. \nI told him that I would call him tomorrow (today) with a final decision. \n\n\nWhat annoys me the most is that I know what's going to happen if I say that we're not going.\n My step-siblings are going to get mad at ME and I can't say the main reasons that made me stay here: \n\n1. My dad doesn't want to (he wasn't open, he made it so i had to make the decision ALL by myself but tried to convice me of not going, so I can't say that because they'll ask him and he will get mad at me and that's something I really don't want to happen)\n\n 2. My mom can't afford it (my dad has to pay my mom a little bit of money to support us every month. Most of the time he isn't punctual and he once paid it 4 months later the whole 4 months at the same time. That's something I don't understand. If I say that she can't afford it, he will get mad because he thinks that my mom manipulates us in order to make us thing that he's a bad dad. He will get mad towards her and that's something I really really really don't want to happen).\n\n 3. Covid (they don't care about covid and they'll think we're making excuses).\n\nSo the decision relies on me. Personally, I don't care if I go, but I know my mom struggles financially so I would prefer not going.\nMy step-siblings can be really toxic. I know they'll get mad at me and next holidays I'll have to face them. Trust me, they've made me suffer emotionally a couple of times. \nWhat should I do?"

Whites, blues, clouds, beaches, big monstera/ palm leaves, etc. On the one hand, they delivered that aesthetic. The Golden Chaser version was white, green, gold. They were in a field. There were sheets blowing in the wind. Normal easy breezy beautiful, ya know? \n\nThen they decided to throw in the Black Chaser version and be all, \u201cyeah we\u2019re soft but also dark and mysterious\u201d which I guess is par for the course in kpop. Always gotta have a darker sexier concept (which I love no hate)\n\nThe teaser is never like the actual song either. There\u2019s always got to be another layer of something distracting from what the actual song will sound like. But in those teasers, there was no mistaking. There was a sound. A DISTINCT cowboy sound.\n\nThe highlight medley confirmed that the song would, in fact, have the Whistle ^TM. A whistle that some (probably definitely almost only me) would associate with a cowboy aesthetic. Watch any cowboy movie, satire or non, and there will at some point be THAT whistle. You know which one I\u2019m talking about too. \n\nPicture this: a camera follows a tumbleweed rolling through town passing a stable, an outhouse, whatever, until eventually rolling past boots with spurs that gleam in the high noon sunlight. Cut to a pair of determined eyes squinting from the sun, despite being shaded by the large cowboy hat. We see his opponent, usually making the same face, but chewing something. Their hands positioned inches from their guns twitch in anticipation. There\u2019s a snake rattle (idk is it a snake rattle I always assumed it was? Maybe cicada??) from somewhere and then... the whistle.\n\nFNC made that sound the opening for SF9\u2019s title track., and had it feature heavily throughout the whole song. And then they had *the absolute gall* to not do a cowboy concept. \n\nCowards.\n\nAll they would\u2019ve had to do is switch out a couple things. By all means, keep the shootout. ~~we know how much kpop boy groups love their guns in mv\u2019s apparently~~ But instead of a fancy bar, make it a dusty old saloon with those slotted doors. Instead of Rowoon in a car racing Hwiyoung on a motorcycle, give em horses! Keep Jaeyoon in that hotel room, but make it old and dusty with a creaky cot and wash basin. Zuho, Inseong, Jaeyoon, and Rowoon could have a casually threatening poker game. Taeyang can do his \u201croll into the saloon with my posse Chani, Youngbin, and Dawon\u201d that he was already planning. Hwiyoung can slam open the saloon doors and step onto a creaky floorboard, causing all eyes to fall on him.\n\nMake them wear chaps. \n\nThat\u2019s all I really wanted was to see SF9 in cowboy paraphernalia. Idk why but specifically Rowoon. It had to be him. He\u2019s not even my bias?? But I know he would ROCK a pair of leather pants, tasseled chaps, and a tasseled long sleeve button down cowboy shirt. Gold sheriff star would be *chef\u2019s kiss*. Tassels everywhere. Boots with the spurs ^with ^the ^spurs  Horses, and tumbleweeds. \n\nI wanted a Mamacita 2.0\n\nDo I love Summer Breeze? Yes. Would I have loved it more with the vision I painted above? **Yes** \n\nTL;DR because dang, I didn\u2019t think I would actually ever write any of this down. Fantasy\u2019s, and the whole kpop consuming world in general, were robbed of what could have been a beautiful cowboy aesthetic concept, brought to you by SF9.\n\nAlso, this probably falls under shitpost, but I\u2019m struggling to find that flair.\n\nIf you made it this far, congratulations. And also, my condolences because I\u2019m sure that the block of text above makes sense to no one else but me."

(A 'world socionics society', if you would, except it doesn't necessarily have to be Jack's). \n\nStep two: Slowly but surely, accumulate power and political legitimacy in your own individual countries. Cooperate to take over all major world powers and governments and install a new socionic world order by federalising all world states into a central government. \n\nStep three: Create a standardised Divergent-style aptitude test, or alternatively, figure out and distill the genetic factor for determining a person's sociotype. Preferably, this should be able to be applied to newborn children. Yes, all children. Out of the placenta, into the agenda. \n\nStep four: Have the entire world population take the standardised socionics test. All persons who do not act within the confines of their assigned type's role and purpose will be promptly unpersoned. Mistypes have no place in this society.\n\nStep five: Divide the land in all cities into separate quadral districts, with inter-quadra interaction greatly minimised by big walls and the fact that the internet is banned. The government-affiliated algorithm will assign each individual (based on their performance, intellect, and loyalty to the state) a dual. If the process of dualisation does not commence, the councils may re-assign you another dual. If the process of dualisation still does not commence with any dual you are assigned with, you are a mistype and will be unpersoned.\n\nStep six: You have a dual now. \n\nBig Daddy Gulenko is watching you."

How did they know they didn't get things wrong?\"\n\n\"They didn't know. Heh.\" The mother chuckles. \"That's the thing with typing back when I was young. It was all a hot mess. I went through the process myself when I enrolled to this school, and even helped streamline it when I got in as a student contributor. I still remember that day...\"\n\n\\-\n\n\\-21 YEARS AGO, SOCION ACADEMY CAMPUS-\n\nA sound of a fist slamming on the table. \"No, no, no. That kid is obviously LIE, like, if she isn't LIE, then nobody is LIE,\" a woman's voice can be heard, her resonance positioned at the very front of her throat.\n\nA masculine voice interjects, his sound flaring up into the head voice of a flamboyant and exasperated tenor. \"Gamma values!? *Where?* Oh, please don't tell me you think-\"\n\nA third voice sharply interrupts his sentence, a nasal tone that threw words out as quickly as a machine gun shoots. \"Don't shove the possibility away. I can actually see where she's coming from. Te base and Te demonstrative could look similar in certain contexts, but this person here is clearly a sensory type. And are we just going to ignore the blatant emphasis on Fe? Surely a Gamma wouldn't-\"\n\n\"We are strangers to her, remember that,\" the woman argues, pressing a finger onto the desk. \"Do notice that the role function shows up as a social mask.\"\n\n\"EIE-DC,\" another man with a mild Russian accent blurts. \"Nonverbal signals show ethics. Cognitive style is clearly-\"\n\n\"Yeah okay, mister Student of Gulenko,\" snaps the woman. \"This kid's ethics is weak, it was spelt out in *CIRCLES* for us during the questionnaire. 1D Fi for sure. Not to mention, you typed 6 *consecutive* students EIE before this one.\"\n\n\"Doesn't mean they can't all be EIE,\" he counters, folding his arms. \"How many times have I repeated this to you? The socion can't just be evenly split because you said so-\"\n\nA fifth person with a deep contralto voice spoke lightly and gently but firmly. \"At this age, the mental ring is not very developed, so we need to make an inference using the vital ring. I do see clear Te and to an extent Fe, but both functions are *instinctual, automatic* and not a conscious effort, so they are in her vital ring. Te is clearly prominent, which would suggest that the student is Te demonstrative. And as this gentleman over here said, SLE? which would certainly be a possibility if we did not take function charges into-\"\n\n\"Get to the damn point. What the hell do you *think* she is?\" The quick-speaking nasal voice interjected again.\n\n\"ILE.\"\n\n\"Seeeee? Valued Fe agreed upon by everyone but *you*! LIE my *ass*.\"\n\nThe first woman snaps. \"Again, the role function-\"\n\nThe other woman continues. \"The School of System Socionics does not use function 'valuation' in its typing methology. I never said I agreed with 'valued' Fe because I do not recognise valuation-\"\n\nThe typee, who was hunched over a desk and yawning, sat alone in a room staring at a one-sided window behind which the typists sat, kept there waiting for the next question. From her perspective, all of them were out of view, but she could hear, loudly broadcasted from the speakers, the continuous, argumentative, haphazard deliberation of something that was in a completely foreign language to her. She took a slight glance at her watch, and finally decided to interrupt.\n\n\"Can I go now or do I have to wait for you to finish blabbing jargon at one another?\" she muttered flatly into her microphone.\n\n\"WAIT- she can hear us?\"\n\n\"Uhh...\" \\[pauses, checks if the microphone is muted\\] \"yeah. She can hear us.\"\n\n\"Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-\"\n\n\"*Leona*! No swearing! A child is listening!\"\n\nLaughter from behind the screen.\n\nThe typee then breathes another sentence sharply into the microphone. \"Is this how you're like with everybody that comes in here or just me?\"\n\nThe feminine voice chirped. \"Oh. Hahahaa! We do this with everyone. It's our honestly-not-very-good typing methodology! We just talk past each other's heads until we reach a consensus. Don't tell *anyone* we do this, though. Just you and us, promise?\"\n\n\"Leona- She doesn't need to know!\" the tenor gasps. \"Do you want the world to think our school is a *sh\\^tshow???\"*\n\nThe shrill laugh of the woman pierced the air again. \"I mean, it is! It doesn't help that the 5 of us are using 5 different models!\"\n\n\"Exactly, Socion Academy should really just pick one and stick with it.\" The Russian man, disgruntled, stopped trying to correct his accent. \"You people aren't going to bother with model G anyways, so you know what, I'm out of here. You guys keep on mistyping people. Bye.\"\n\n\"Aaaaaaand the budget is too limited to hire any more socionists.\"\n\n\\-"

I've changed my number, mailing address, etc. I will be writing a letter letting them know I've left home, am safe, and why I moved out. I'm afraid however, they may try to file a missing person report on me, bother me at work, and try to emotionally coerce me back into their control. I can bypass the missing persons report by calling the non-emergency police, but they sadly know where I work as they have dropped me off. What could I do to stay safe?"

My parents have made jokes stalking my whereabouts whether I'm at work or hanging out with my friends, hell for one place I was trying to apply to, my dad made a joke about working as a dishwasher at the same place I applied to, and it made me so uncomfortable.\n\nBoth my parents are bad, but I particularly dislike my mother. She is controlling, fear-mongering, and believes that everything must be done her way or else. Because of her need for control, she has taken away my right to autonomy and to resolve that I will be moving out. \n\nHowever the few main things that really scare me are as follows; if my parents try to call the police on me and the authorities side with them to make me return home, if they end up stalking my work after I move out, if they try to psychologically hurt me or my roommates, and if they can control over me all they want due to my autism. Am I out of luck or might I have a chance of the law being on my side for freedom?"

Right now, since I don't wanna deal with parking (it's hard to find any and passes are expensive), I commute to school. Additionally I have to take three buses to get to school/work and it takes over an hours to get there. Also, whenever I have night classes or am at my club meeting, I'd rather spend $25 on an Uber going home than have my dad pick me up because I have a strained relationship with him to the point I can't talk about anything with him.\n\nMy dad and I have views that clash with one another, which makes things already hard enough. He's also said that I've done so well in my life despite being diagnosed with autism; hearing that is so harmful to my well-being and my beliefs. I remember the first time I tried moving out (but failed due to endless guilt trips), he proposed that I give him money every month as \"practice rent\" instead, to which I said no. He also claims he knows me better than anyone else, but there is so much about me he has no idea about. He's made some icky remarks as well, which I don't wanna say, but you can infer what I'm saying. \n\nI hope you'll accept me for taking this big decision dad. I just need a positive masculine figure to hear from."

Right now I don't own a car and I don't wanna deal with the shitty parking situation at school, so I commute via bus and it takes an hour to get to school; additionally, I have to take three different buses to get to school/work on time and waking early or calling Uber when I wake up late and end up paying 30$ is such a hassle. \n\nI could explain all this to my mother, but she'll use the amount of money I owe after I graduate and my disability as leverage, even though I have good financial habits and calculated the cost carefully and lots of autistic people live away from home just fine. Additionally hearing texts from her trigger my anxiety and she has fear-mongered, controlled, and made very inappropriate jokes and remarks (like stalking me at school/work/any place I hangout, how much I eat, what I wear, what I do with my money, etc.). She also holds beliefs which are backwards and harmful to my identity.\n\nAnyhow, I just wanted to break you the news I'm moving out. I hope you'll take this well."

So here's the deck list of cards that REALLY matter:\n\nCollector\nMorbius\nMODOK\nHelicarrier\n\nThat way, if you've played your cards right (pun intended), you fuel Morb when MODOK discards your hand, but ALSO fuel Collector when Helicarrier gets discarded and bring in the reinforcements.\n\nSome other good cards I've been running with them:\n\nMoon Girl/DD are obvious good back-up with Collector if you haven't drawn MODOK by Turn 4\n\nSentinel just continuously powers up Collector so thats not bad.\n\nQuinjet is kind of lame, but it does help Sentinel a bit.\n\nSunspot doesn't synergize GREAT but you *are* skipping turns sometimes to build up your hand so he doesn't TOTALLY suck\n\nAnd Mantis/Agent 13 obviously work great for Coll/DD\n\nHonestly I've been swapping out the last spot a few times just to try and find something, and I'm not even in love with Sentinel... any suggestions?

I have often make a huge fuzz on posting my artwork online and it has given me so much anxiety. Occurring thoughts would be like: \"Why am I still posting my artwork online? I gain few likes and I doubt a lot of people care\" The anxiety of doubt I feel everytime I post something online was enough to make me quit being an artist in general. It hits more when you don't have a lot of followers.\n\nIt made me wonder as to why I care so much of it to begin with? The sole reason why I created the account was to be part of the community and to share my artwork to the rest of the world and simply have fun. But somewhere along the way my mind was focus to clout and numbers but I supposed that's everyone's story. It dawn me as I often scroll down to my ig feed on several fellow artists I follow, I take those short moments to appreciate those drawings but never even once hyper focus on how many likes and followers they have. It hit me I'm not the only one like this right? Why did I freakin care so much in the first place?\n\nAt least your art is seen and if it's ever gain likes and follows that's just an added bonus. Never based your worth as an artist over it, it really kills your creativity and motivation to draw again in which I'm slowly recovering.",

It was only my twin brother and myself who was awake at the time but it was my brother who first smelled something off outside. I was nearly done brushing my teeth and doing my nightly skincare routine when my brother faintly smelled something burning while he was in the middle of playing Valo. I was confused why he suddenly paused the game and ran off outside with a cup of water while I was watching him play a bit, but he thought he caused a small fire at our balcony due to his smoking but that wasn't the case. \n\nA little later on the smell got stronger and we faintly heard crackling sounds outside as if something exploded far off the distance. My brother was first to investigate outside and plan to call 911 if it's some kind of dumpster fire. His reaction when he saw something at the back of our apartment turned serious while I was outside on my balcony on lookout, that I quickly followed him when he ran off. By the time I was at the back parking lot of my apartment, it took awhile for me to notice a huge mushroom cloud of smoke off the distance. To put it in perspective, there are series of small apartments where I live beside a busy street in which I delightfully hear honking cars in daytime, but behind is a large neighbourhood of houses. The fire was somewhere located deep inside those houses, to the right side where we live.\n\nSoon enough I catch up where my brother is and we decided to get closer look of the fire. It wasn't very far and luckily my brother knows the way inside the neighbourhood better than I do and by the time we found a close enough spot all I could see is a roof on a house is on fire while there was a wooden fence that blocks everything else. We were at some local park while they were a lot of other people is spectating on what's happening. The firemen already arrived and never heard so many sirens in my life. My brother thinks there was a gas leak which cause those small explosions earlier and never really believed it until when we walk back and they were debris scattered everywhere and the foggy smoke even reach where we live.  \n\nOverall it was some night. I definitely couldn't go back to sleep after that. I think there's some curiosity and even dare admit thrill and excitement when witnessing something like that. But also guilt because there could have been people who seriously got hurt from that fire. But have you witnessed something similar like this before? This would be my second time since the first happened to the old apartment I live in which luckily the fire was snuff out in time."

I WAS JUST IRRITATED.\n\nIt\u2019s too painful and I can\u2019t bare this assumption upon me that I will not thrive out there and the fact that they said that no family will ever accept me as their own all because I scream and shout when annoyed by loud noise and because I am autistic.  \n\n\nIt feels so cold, pitiful and bitter\u2026  \n\n\nI wish a loving family could just adopt me away from my shitty biological parentas or at least have a biological aunt or uncle adopt me and be better than my biological parents.\n\nPeople in the cult I grew up and am in are nothing but bastards, hypocrites, narcissistic, manipulative and the leader, greedy.\n\nThe fact my biological mother also said that she will stop providing me what I want and need if I don\u2019t \u201cchange\u201d and that I\u2019m becoming \u201crude\u201d \u201crebellious\u201d and \u201cunappreciative\u201d and to top it all off \u201dlazy.\u201d\n\nHow dare you call yourselves my parents?! I know you might\u2019ve given me a ton of maids from when I was little but they weren\u2019t enough. No I\u2019m not spoiled, I was neglected. My maids didn\u2019t care, they only cared for me all because it\u2019s all about the money in the end.  \n\n\nAnd not only does my mother threaten to never continue the trip that my family was invited to all because of my \u201cbehavior,\u201d but also she told me I am not allowed to ever go on trips anymore or go out.  \n\n\nNow I\u2019m the \u201ccrazy\u201d \u201cimmature\u201d and \u201cchildish\u201d one?"

I remember learning how to flip my first over-easy egg at 9 and the pride it brought. I remember learning to make deviled eggs. I have made delicious deviled eggs for parties and family gatherings. I taught my dad how to make eggs Gordon Ramsay style, which upgraded our scrambled egg game considerably. I learned to fry my eggs Spanish-style, which burned my hands with the oil but was worth the perfectly cooked white and yolk. I love eggs - scrambled, fried, deviled, boiled, you name it. The yolk is comforting and the white is a good source of protein. Naming these good memories makes me almost not want to leave them, but I must.\n\nI love eggs, but eggs do not love me. When I eat them, my stomach aches and I feel sick to my stomach. I used to think that if I got used to eggs, I could get rid of this feeling, but I can not. I have been sticking with eggs for all these years for the high of the good times, but the low of the bad times is not worth it. This weekend was a wake-up call. I had to stay in bed all day Saturday because eating two boiled eggs sickened me worse than the current plague did. I am now losing weight because my stomach is taking a while to handle additional food after the havoc these round white devils have wreaked on my system. Everyone sees eggs, and (mostly) everyone loves them. A breakfast hardly exists without them and weightlifters and grandmas alike love them. However, my relationship with them is toxic and damaging. It is time for me to let them go.\n\nGoodbye, eggs. We had some good times. There are plenty of other people who can love you, but our time is over."

But remember this, you don't need motivation to start something because motivation isn't easy to come by when needed(pretty L of brain). This is where self-discipline comes and saves the day. Once again, it's not easy to build it, but you have to start somewhere don't you. 2hours a day is progress nonetheless. 20mins is progress nonetheless. Consistency builds up on little work and it goes a long way. You see results in 2weeks/4weeks, and you see progress within a month. THAT's when motivation occurs. Once you get on the grind, You gotta grasp on that rope as firmly as you can.    \n Go ahead and game/watch/chat in your daily schedule. Allow yourself time to yourself. Don't leave your hobbies out.   \nYou got this, waiting for your grind. Trust your process and trust your preparation.",

I\u2019m extremely concerned about the prospect of being in this cold for that long (edit: feels like -18 with wind chill). I\u2019m waiting to hear from my manager to see if there will be heaters for the staff, but honestly, I\u2019m not sure if that would even make much of a difference. Besides, who is actually going to want to attend an outdoor bar with a cold advisory statement in place anyway? I worked a similar shift during Christmas where the low was -5 and my toes still went numb. Do I have the right to refuse this shift?\n\n\nEDIT: haha, I was not expecting this to blow up. I can\u2019t respond to everyone, but thanks to those who provided helpful information about what employers are required to do in the case of extreme cold. You guys are awesome! \n\nI did end up doing the shift and was pleasantly surprised at how much my manager accommodated us today: strong heaters installed above and below the bar (not present the last time I worked), the warming pads you mentioned, frequent breaks inside, and extra toques and jackets. I\u2019m not originally from Canada so I get that a lot of you like to play the cold Olympics here, but I\u2019ve never had to work in such conditions and felt justifiably anxious. But my place of work followed all the protocol mentioned here, so I\u2019m super grateful for that.\n\nI understand that a lot of other professions, particularly those in the trades, have to undergo much worse conditions every day, and while I have tremendous respect for that, I don\u2019t see how relevant it is in this context. Part of those jobs requires having gear that can withstand extreme temperatures. I\u2019ve never invested in extremely heavy-duty winterwear because it\u2019s never been a part of my job or lifestyle. I\u2019ve worked at my current job for many years, and this season was the first time I\u2019ve ever had to work outside for long stretches of time. But my defensiveness aside, thank you to those who do work in those conditions regularly, as I definitely did gain a new level of respect for what you guys go through."

I want to make a series that gets at the feeling of the internet as being this very strange/paradoxical part of our everyday reality, kind of in the way the Bo Burnham song, \"That Funny Feeling\" touches on.\n\nI feel like we're all going through this really disorienting phase of humanity together, and I want to read a couple of books that addresses it in a narrative way. I don't want a nonfiction book that waxes poetic over the time we're living in, as those are a dime a dozen. I'm also not really interested in a book like \"Ready Player One\" that seems to rely on pop-culture and nostalgia for entertainment purposes (tbh I haven't read it, so if you think I should after what I've written here, tell me why). Science fiction is fine, but I'm a lot more interested in the human condition, plus I really love metaphors and symbolism, lol.\n\nHope you guys get what I'm trying to say, and that such a book even exists! Thanks!\n\nP.S. I'm also cool with graphic novels, short stories, poetry, zines, etc. Just staying away from nonfiction because I've had a lot of exposure to that already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: thanks for the suggestions guys!

She and my whole family live in the US, while I (29 years old) made the decision to live in Canada 10 years ago. She's always made comments about me leaving, but I went to be in a relationship and am happier here. I visit when I can but it ends up being about once a year.\n\nRight now, I'm not able to work because there are still restrictions in my country about working with large groups of people (I work in events), so I'm collecting money from the government. I make just enough to keep me alive, but I can't save money. Part of the condition of my ability to receive this money is by staying in the country. There is also the fact that if/when I fly into the US, I'll have to isolate for up to 10 days, meaning my trip will have to be longer. Then, when I come back into Canada, I am forced to stay in a government-approved hotel at my own expense, which ends up being $2000+. I'm also forced to prove that I have a negative test before I leave, and to ensure I get it within a 2 day period, I have to pay $250. My parents have offered help me out with this, including the flight itself, but it's so much money and it makes me extremely uncomfortable to make them do that. My parents are comfortable, but they're not rich, so there's only so much they can do.\n\nA couple of months ago on a family zoom call, I tried to float the fact that I may not be able to go because of all of these restrictions. But she put on a very forceful voice and said that it was non-negotiable that I be there. Obviously I want to go to my sister's wedding and celebrate her life and all that. But she's having a big wedding during a time when it's clearly difficult for me to be crossing borders. I understand that things are going back to normal in the US, but things are even worse in Canada now, and even with my family's financial help, I'm afraid this is going to break me.\n\nFor what it's worth, I got married 8 years ago, and while she was able to come to the wedding, my brother couldn't, and I never held it against him. I feel like she will hold a grudge against me forever if I don't go.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I put my foot down on this and didn't go? Feel free to ask follow-up questions if I didn't make myself seem like enough of an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: thanks everyone for your reassurance. This has been really stressing me out and I was getting in my head a bit. I appreciate having an outside perspective, so thanks to you guys I'm not going to stress as much about not being able to go."

A perfectly led move over 4 or 8 half-counts can require getting several things right, where poor inaccuracy in just one aspect is enough to tank your success rate on that move.

Another contributing factor is likely that your subconscious is being teased by what seems to be within reach yet remains frustratingly unfulfilled.\n\nIf you want to avoid this being \"kind fun/exciting/satisfying yet also frustrating/annoying/overwhelming\", there are two things to work on. Firstly, develop your relationship with yourself, because it's being tested when in fact many (but of course not all) of your needs can be met here. Avoid losing your sense of self in reckless pursuit of external validation. Secondly, if you want to address the negative feelings in between social interactions, you need to be honest about what needs and wants are driving those feelings and you need to do something about it. The most direct path to resolving those feelings is to be vulnerable with people, disclose those specific feelings authentically and without expectation and see what happens. This might involve calling friends when you feel that way. The results will help bridge the insecurity and lack of connectedness you feel with others.",

                "created_utc": 1673503488.0,
                "body": "You've probably heard of the idea that if you get better by 1% every day, after 365 days you're 37.78x better than when you started. While idea of compounding gains is inspiring, I'm not sure it's humanly possible to improve by 1% every day, or let alone to never have a day of regression. That doesn't really line up with the theory of practicing a skill, where plateaus are a feature not a bug.\n\nI probably took the 1% example too literally, but here are two adjustments I made to the idea.\n\n# Aim for 1% improvement per week instead\n\nThe idea is to **take actions** that could **improve your life** (make it easier, save time, reduce stress, increase enjoyment, etc) in a way that's **semi-long-term**. A good ballpark might be aiming to spend 4 hours a week for that 1% improvement.\n\nSome categories of types of improvement:\n\n* Increasing knowledge. Reading 4 hours of a self-help book. You don't know what you'll get out of it but if this book has some valuable insights that lead you to change something about your life, it's quite plausible that it could contribute a 3% medium term spike in improvement or a 1% long-term sustained improvement.\n* Permanently saving time. You can save time in your weekly schedule by researching how to do something more effectively or faster (e.g., cooking, organization, other chores), or by automating processes (grocery delivery, email filtering, apps for self-blocking social media at certain times). Spending 4 hours and then figuring out how to shave 30 minutes off your weekly routine is definitely a gain.\n* Improving physical, mental, or spiritual well-being. This overlaps with knowledge, but maybe you spent 4 hours researching how to eat healthier or identifying possible deficits in your nutritional profile or you decided to get tested for allergies. Eating better reduces lost vitality, making your life easier. Or you tried new strategies for focusing that are better than your previous ones. Maybe you choose to actively improve on a skill that you previously only maintained.\n* Increasing income or financial freedom, or investing in knowledge/networking/skills that will eventually lead to this.\n* Saving money. Maybe you invest in learning to sew or how to shave using a proper razor rather than disposables.\n\nNotice that the improvement comes from the actions you took in previous weeks, as opposed to the actions you're performing in the current week. That's how progress happens when we talk about the long term: accumulation of past investments that seemingly made no difference at the time.\n\nAlso note that there are a million things that seem productive but don't actually make your life tangibly better or worse, take note of those too and purge them as necessary.\n\n# Preventing regression also counts as 1% improvement\n\nThe idea of 1% improvement is just an idea to strive for, not something you can guarantee. Frankly, even 1% improvement per week doesn't sound easy to me. No one knows what your actual growth will be, but over the long run some of those 1% attempts will come out big, and some of them will actually be negative. But you experiment and trust in the learning process. It's impossible to improve consistently without making mistakes and experiencing plateaus/regression and exploring the unfamiliar, so never beat yourself up for that.\n\nIn fact, sometimes life throws a curveball at you, one that you may not be well-equipped to handle given your current life experience or circumstance. That curveball will inevitably set you back and make your life worse. If it were about to make your life worse by 5%, but you made it your goal for that week, or even that month, to reduce that impact down to 4%, that's actually a very big deal. Sometimes external factors are going to dictate the direction that it shifts you, but you can change the magnitude of it as your 1%.\n\n**Reducing a regression** that would have set you back even further *is* an improvement in the context of **things that you can control.** Surviving to fight another day/week/month for 1% improvement later is a legitimate thing.\n\n**TL:DR; Don't judge yourself by unrealistic standards, long-term compounding improvement at any rate is a big deal.**\n\nWhat are your thoughts or experiences on compounding gains?"

She said that the goal of therapy is to bring me closer to the second picture, where the outer petals are still present but the inner petals grow longer and extend significantly past some of the outer petal regions.\n\nShe didn't actually explain the second one but I took it to mean that the responsible adult/parent is still operating but they're dialed back such that the inner child fills most of the presence, and she implied that this is a healthier/happier way to live.\n\nI relate to this now because my inner child definitely isn't thriving even though the part of me trying to be really responsible has been very effective at its job. But this isn't sustainable and I'm not sure how to find better balance, I don't think it's as simple as doing more or doing less.\n\nNOTE: My therapist didn't actually explain this so I'm just filling in the blanks, my guess at the explanation could be completely off."

Devon's description goes something like this:\n\n* Although autism can present itself in a wide range of patterns, common to every autistic person is processing of the world in a bottom up way.\n* Autism touches every part of an autistic person's life.\n* Autism is basically inseparable from an autistic person's identity, they wouldn't be them without it. (Devon uses this to suggest that \"autistic person\" is a more identity-respecting term than \"person with autism\".)\n\nDo you agree with this idea of autism being central to your identity and life experience or can this be taken too far?\n\nOn one hand, I see that the more I examine my life and behaviors from the lens of autism, the more it makes sense that so many seemingly unrelated experiences and preferences I have/had can in fact be explained by some underlying patterns that aren't random coincidence. Ignoring or failing to recognise patterns that relate to how one can live well and thrive is harmful in the long run.\n\nBut the flip side is, what if I start writing off things that I'm fully capable of eventually being able to do by accidentally blaming or over-attributing the effect of autistic traits? How do I ensure that I'm not over-identifying with autism just because things aren't magically easy? Maybe they aren't easy for NTs either, how can we ever know how hard something is for the average person?\n\nAnother thing that makes me question the sensibility of the assertion of autism being \"inseparable\" from an autistic person's experience: even if it were, how could any of us ever soundly come to that sweeping conclusion? Isn't the only reference for us knowing that a behavior is autistic based on the fact that autism isn't the norm and that we can't always do what comes naturally to others?"

                "body": "I've watched Jordan Peterson with casual interest over the years, and one question mark that has grown rather than diminished for me is the common accusation I hear from women that he is prejudiced against women.\n\nThe truth is, I've never found any concrete evidence for this. Women have cited him openly hating on women, but the examples presented to me have always been quotes taken out of context or situations where he happened to use an example and that example might be a provocative one such as the likelihood (but not certainty) that a career-focused woman approaching the age of 30+ is most likely to eventually realize that they actually desperately want to have kids.\n\nAnother vibe I often hear from women who otherwise respect him is simply \"I wish he had good advice for women but he simply doesn't, other than to have children.\" Obviously this is an oversimplification, but these opinions are coming from open-minded women who don't have anything against the controversial parts of JP, or at least \"peak JP\". I think that there is at least a grain of truth that JP has a disproportionate lack of advice for women for a person of his background. To flesh out this lack:\n\n* I've literally never heard him give advice relevant to career-focused women who legitimately will never want to have kids, and given that the child-bearing thing is one of his favorite examples, why doesn't he ever talk about this flip side given that it still affects many women even if the minority?\n* I don't have facts but based on my own background in research, I definitely get the sense that JP probably cherry picks data when it comes to feminism and gender gap topics. He has an unreasonable lack of doubt that his overarching perspectives are correct, and even peak JP doesn't fill me with confidence as being able to change his mind if the tides of evidence started to shift against his views.\n* This phenomenon has gotten worse over time, c.f. JP on climate change.\n* The same way that he doesn't seem to have practical advice for the minority of women who never want to have kids, JP also seems to never speak to examples where trans people do actually need their transition. Like he acknowledges the possibility but has no practical advice for this side of the coin. I also saw JP recently answer a question on advice for being accepted as a homosexual in society, and his answer was surprisingly impractical, basically he said \"deviate from the norm at your peril, you really want to conform to Christian ideals of sex and marriage as much as possible\".\n* Lastly, I've heard the accusation that JP is clearly misogynistic even if he doesn't say anything that's necessarily misogynistic, the same way he supposedly hides his able-ism and prejudice against LBGTQI people but it comes through subconsciously.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nUltimately, what I'm curious about is whether JP has a limiting concept of women. I've acknowledged that the concerns and accusations to this end aren't backed by any concrete evidence whatsoever. Even so, I think that patterns of what a person *doesn't* say, especially when they are as vocal as JP and have had large amounts of air time do sometimes have discernable meaning.\n\nI don't think it's farfetched to say that JP sometimes holds surprisingly weak or easily disproven perspectives on certain aspects of issues he supposedly cares a lot about, even within psychology, and that there are possible patterns to these weak perspectives. Is it because he doesn't actually care about those issues, or because he can only see one side of the coin due to bias or ignorance, or because he holds disdain for one side? Or perhaps he wants to help one side more than the other because that's where he sees himself contributing the most?"

And yet, in 2022 especially I noticed there have been situations where I'm completely unable to let go of an emotion no matter what techniques I use (of the ones I've learned). I might get temporarily relief at best when trying to process and regulate my emotions.\n\nBasically, it starts off with a person who's opinion I care about and they do something that I perceive as them treating me poorly. I might know that my impression is unreliable or that they have other stuff going on that explains why they treated me unfairly, but at this point I can't hold my feelings back, they fester and I get really angry and upset, and holding it in only delays an inevitable eruption. I'm just unable to be the bigger person or be chill or be understanding and let go of my upset.\n\nWhen I do express myself to them, basically I let them know that I'm upset, why I'm upset, what impact it has made on my life. I don't request anything specific from them other than that they hear me out. After that, depending on whether they apologize or acknowledge what I've been through or not, my feelings may quickly resolve as I realize how reasonable their side of things has been, that they didn't deliberately hurt me. Or alternatively, I continue being upset at them if they rejected my perspective and offer zero empathy and I subsequently try to cut them off from my life or demote them in my mind to someone unworthy of my kindness and consideration.\n\nEither way, I know I'm behaving in a somewhat impulsive manner that some people might say is more common for children who lack emotional maturity. But as far as I know, I really can't seem to do any better. I do my heavy self-expression, (and by the way, when I'm upset like that I can barely function productively at work), and I experience the positive or negative consequence of my \"overreaction\", and only then do I gain the experience to be able to handle the same situation better in future without being as \"dramatic\".\n\nThis kind of thing might happen 1-2 times a year with a boss, friend, colleague, family member, or someone I'm dating."

Kat on the other hand LOVES drama and often will try to start it for fun, but when it matters she is always willing to put in the work to support a friend.

I have always been very naturally good at sex and have never had an unsatisfied customer, and this has caused me many an issue because I often have trouble cumming from just penatration. I have severe sexual trauma from my childhood, so it's difficult for me to allow people to go down on me in any way. I told my bf about this and he has been extremely understanding, which I appreciate so so much, but I think this has been (in part) hindering our sex life.

I don't want to tell him I'm not enjoying myself as much as he is and have it end up creating a similar problem to that of some past relationships where they start to feel inferior and it only makes things awkward (which I feel may be likely here because our chemistry is insane and I've helped him discover a lot about what he's into), but I don't know how to suggest things nor do I know what to suggest.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly *appreciate* the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase \"Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic *Fathers and Sons* I'm smirking right now just *imagining* one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

She sounds awful.\n\nHOWEVER, the thing to do in situations like this in interpersonal relationships is to trust your memory and dump them if you feel lied to and especially gaslit, not record others without their consent. Doing that will ruin any interpersonal relationship you ever do it in--- it makes people paranoid (you could always be recording and catch something embarrassing (not even evil, just embarrassing) that they do or say) and pretty much abolishes trust and privacy forever. Only do it to people you never want to see again.\n\nIt sounds like you did not have the confidence to trust your memory this time--- that's something to fix going forward. You need to have that confidence and trust in yourself and your sanity or you will keep attracting manipulators. They can sniff out people who can be convinced they heard something that never happened and vice versa. Manipulators do not date people who trust themselves for very long.\n\nLastly and most importantly--- stop talking to her. You all are broken up and the relationship sounds toxic as hell. Messaging her just to play the tape was very immature. You don't have to \"win\" the breakup---- that's not a thing.  I know you thought it would make you feel better, but interacting with nonsense just drags it out. And dragging it out makes your life worse. Cut her off. Your closure is that she lied to you at least once and that you all bring out the worst in each other and make an awful couple. \n\nCut her off and put this all behind you.

Liquor stores tend to attract these types of people and the staff is probably used to shoo-ing people away who beg or harass paying customers. They'll most likely take care of it if you clue them in on what happened, and she shows up trying it again. \n\n\\- The police aren't going to be able to do anything. You gave the money willingly and it's a very small amount (maybe not for you, but big picture). Most police don't even really investigate home robberies if there's no leads, reports are typically just for insurance records and city-wide statistics. Your situation sadly wouldn't really benefit from contacting them as your $40 was not stolen by force or insured. \n\n\\- Going forward, practice being slightly more assertive in your daily life so that in larger situations like this you are better at saying no. Next time your order is wrong (politely) tell the staff at a restaurant. Next time someone cuts you in line, go ahead let them know that you think they were mistaken and missed the real end of the line. Next time a friend or family member asks for a small favor, say no if it's genuinely too much for you at that moment. Assertiveness is a skill and if you practice it, you'll be much better under pressure. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not blaming you at all, by the way. I myself have lent money to someone out of pure awkwardness (much more money than you did) who had no intention of paying me back, so I said that last point from experience. I've practiced being a little more assertive in the intervening years and it really does work. Saying no does not necessarily mean confrontation, and even when it does, you'll typically be just fine. \n\nSorry that happened to you, sounds very awkward and like a bummber.",

Some anti-perspirants ALSO have deodorant scents added to them, but not all deodorants are anti-perspirants.

That's not what a partner in love does or how a successful open marriage plays out. The marriage is genuinely failing--- failing for \"good\" reasons or \"dumb\" reasons isn't really a way to look at it. The marriage failing because your brother is (maybe, I don't know him) dumb is different from a dumb reason for a marriage to fail. It sounds like this marriage SHOULD end based on the poor decisions your brother is making as a partner in it. He's not being a healthy partner and that's a GOOD reason to end a marriage, not a dumb one. Dumb person doesn't equal dumb reason. \n\nOn the other hand, if you think his new fling is dangerous and unhealthy, you CAN speak on that to him out of love. Do not do this with the expectation that he will go back to his marriage, only that he will leave something unhealthy behind.",

Probably 5\u20192, 290-320 lbs., and is asthmatic and pre-diabetic. I\u2019ve heard her snore when she sleeps and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she had some sort of mild sleep apnea. \n\nThis all makes me very concerned for her going under any anesthesia. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if this surgery is technically elective or not, but she mentioned the surgery being \u201cmuch faster\u201d recovery time than 6-8 weeks in a cast, which makes me think maybe she had both options. \n\nIf she has the option to avoid the surgery and just spend a longer period of time in a cast, would it be wiser to try and convince her to do so? Am I correct to be terrified of her going under anesthesia given her stats, or is this a decently routine \u201cnot optimal\u201d situation? What would be the (hypothetical) odds that something awful happens when she goes under? \n\nThanks for any info. I\u2019m kind of an uptight health nut, so her weight and chronic issues have always been something that stressed me out as it is, so I\u2019m not sure if this is just me overreacting or if I should actually look closer into her situation."

And a ton of debate over whether she truly believed or not. \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t really make her a better person one way or the other if she truly believed that or not. \n\nShe was willing to STEAL from her employees to get it.

Congrats honestly. Pay for it with your own salary, not mine, thief. \n\nThe fact that Anthony/Shane was abusive/literally stealing from her accounts at the end is relevant to how much your empathize with her. But the whole \u201cI REALLY wanted to save my dog and have a magic family!\u201d thing is not really a point in her favor the way her and some of the others in the docu and in online discussions act like it is. Replace \u201ca magic cult family and immortal pets\u201d with, like, \u201cthe dopest Ferrari\u201d or \u201can amazing vacation\u201d and it emphasizes just how okay she is with stealing if it\u2019s going to buy her what she and her partner wants. \n\nHow much she actually believed in the new-age-y magic stuff is kind of irrelevant.

So I don\u2019t know why the docu and especially people online act like it\u2019s super relevant to know whether she really believed in that stuff. \n\nThe actual relevant info is: She was abused and did something shitty while in that situation.

I've found I actually have pretty tough fingers tips due to some other hobbies of mine, so a very basic amount of protection is probably just fine as well. \n\nBut I've had a surprisingly hard time finding clear recs online on what the best picks in my situation might be, things like: how many fingers to get, plastic vs. metal, how concerned I should be about sizing? (I'm a young woman and 5'2\" vs grown men who tend to be writing most of the info on this stuff), if should get wearable picks at all or just use held ones like a guitar. I've even seen recommendations that I should actually just get the wrapped wire looking picks that people use on the sitar, instead of any of the other typical ones I've been looking at. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if anyone can point me in the right direction, I'd love that! A link or brand to look into would be amazing, but even just some thoughts on what aspects are probably going to be most relevant to the type of player I am at the moment is helpful as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr- New to autoharp, only play for personal enjoyment, would like to get picks of some type for melody work.

The guilt feelings are insane. \n\nI can't say much, only that you are not alone. I am glad you shared this, because it shows you are able to talk about it.

The next morning I woke up with severe epigastric pain that lasted for three days until I started on dietary restrictions (low fat, low acid, low spice) and a PPI, which I took for 14 days. \n\nMy GI medical history consists of:\n\n* Idiopathic duodenal ulcers in 2016 and 2017\n* GERD since 2000 (diagnosed at age 8)\n* Lactose intolerance \n\nI'm 29F, white, 5'5, and 110 lbs. I exercise 5-7 days a week. I drink a ton of water. I don't drink soda and very rarely drink alcohol. I've never smoked in my life. I don't use any recreational drugs. I never binge eat. I take a probiotic suggested by my GI doc, a multivitamin, and I've been on a combined oral contraceptive daily x 11 years. My GERD is controlled by diet, and occasionally an H2-blocker if I choose to drink coffee that day or something.\n\nI finished the PPI a few days ago. I'm somewhat better, but I'm still suffering early satiety and occasional heart burn. I'm terrified to eat normally again. \n\nIf I go to my GI, I'm worried he'll just say it's anxiety, GERD, or send me for another EGD, but I'm also concerned that if I don't, I might be ignoring something important."

Thin, but has a good bit of muscle. \n\nColor Scheme: Mainly neutral darker colors, but slight purple accents.\n\nGear: What I believe is called a tailcoat, a scarf, and a messenger bag that have obviously seen some action. also if you don't mind add a pair of hippie looking purple glasses. ( I put a picture for reference on the coat as I have no clue if I said it's correct name)\n\nAction/Pose: Sorta relaxed with hands in pockets.\n\nAlignment: Lawful Neutral. \n\nPersonality Traits: A very chill relaxed crackhead kinda person.  Doesn't care what people do as long as they don't harm others. Likes to make a fool of wealthy assholes and anyone being a being an ass in general. In a fight can often be found on the front lines wanting to beat the closest thing to him, but not to a point where he will throw himself into danger with no one to help him. \n\nIdeals and Goals: Doesn't really have any as he's already lost everything, just wants to get through life.\n\nBonds and Flaws: Sorta out of it, very chill, but often comes up with ideas that can only be described as something a crackhead would come up with. \n\nBackstory: Was born into a poor monastery and was raised by his grandfather. Eventually him and the other young members of the monastery decided to steal from and blackmail anyone who met two requirements: wealthy, and corrupt. After a few months they got caught and he was the only one to escape.\n\n[Coat for reference](https://preview.redd.it/33aha0jk22t41.jpg?width=226&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=869c526bf7fbed814b898794ec270d5a6f676ebb)\n\n[Flower charm](https://preview.redd.it/zk3cn1jk22t41.png?width=211&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5d63e3b0462fba1c50513f808c51bcdf983c602)"

Newer infrastructure, not the current shit built during the civil war, but like hi-tech stuff (looking at you japan). Having an abundance of trains from state to state connecting to all states would improve lives of everyone, *dramatically.* imo the biggest thing that most Americans are missing out on is traveling; forget going to other countries according to a forbes article, [54% of americans visited less than 10 states.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lealane/2019/05/02/percentage-of-americans-who-never-traveled-beyond-the-state-where-they-were-born-a-surprise/?sh=5608e1982898)\n\n[https://travelhub.wttc.org/blog/9-reasons-travel-is-good-for-your-mental-health#:\\~:text=Travel%20helps%20your%20brain%20function,more%20deeply%2C%20and%20integrate%20thoughts](https://travelhub.wttc.org/blog/9-reasons-travel-is-good-for-your-mental-health#:~:text=Travel%20helps%20your%20brain%20function,more%20deeply%2C%20and%20integrate%20thoughts).\n\n>Travel is a great way to maintain mental well-being, and, by extension, it contributes to a happier and more fulfilling life. So, here are 9 reasons why travel is good for your mental health.  \n>  \n>**Travel allows you to try new things and meet new people, helping you combat monotony**.  \n>  \n>**Activities like walking, hiking, and skiing in scenic areas can help you become more hopeful**.  \n>  \n>**Travel is great for relieving stress and improving your general outlook on life**.  \n>  \n>**Travel helps your brain function better and boosts creativity**. Immersing yourself in new cultures increases your mind\u2019s ability to move between different ideas, think more deeply, and integrate thoughts. **\u201cForeign experiences increase cognitive flexibility and depth and integrativeness of thought,\u201d says Adam Galinsky, a professor and author of numerous studies on the connection between creativity and international travel.**  \n>  \n>**Time away from work can increase your energy and productivity at work**. A Harvard Business Review study of over 400 travellers found that 94% of respondents had as much or more energy after coming back from a good trip. So, book that holiday and crush your work goals when you return!  \n>  \n>**Taking a trip helps you do good, which helps you feel good**. Some evidence suggests that helping others can promote physiological changes in the brain linked with happiness. Spending money during your holidays in restaurants, attractions and even locally made souvenirs helps support the 330 million people who rely on the sector for their livelihoods. You can also help by volunteering with a reputable local organisation!  \n>  \n>**A wellness trip can contribute to better mental health.** On a wellness retreat focused on practices like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness, you can learn skills that you can bring home to help you keep up a regular wellness routine. This routine will be key to maintaining more robust mental health. Can\u2019t you just imagine yourself learning centuries-old yoga practices on an idyllic beach?  \n>  \n>**Doing something you enjoy makes you happy**.  \n>  \n>**Travelling with loved ones helps meet your needs for love and belonging**. Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs identifies love and belonging as key psychological human needs. Sharing your amazing travel adventures with loved ones helps enhance your connection with them while intensifying feelings of love, belonging, and fulfilment. Think of a family holiday on a beautiful island or a trip to eating all sorts of delicious food with your best friend.\n\nOf course this is probably impossible without moass and as always thanks for coming to my ted talk. I don't believe the government is willing to even do something like this even knowing it's a huge net positive. \n\nEdit: Here's the difference between Murica vs eu trains [https://i.redd.it/lso1gbozd26a1.jpg](https://i.redd.it/lso1gbozd26a1.jpg)",

(Or whatever time it is for you)\n\nSo, I\u2019ve had my PS5 for about 6 months now, and for about the past month or so, I\u2019ve been experiencing terrible lag spikes when jumping out of the bus at the start of a match, and in the late game. My monitor does not support 120 frames, so I play on a 60 frame limit. However, when jumping from the bus I spike to about 40 frames for a bit, and late game I experience some terrible lag spikes where I drop to like 16 frames for a few seconds. May not seem like that big of a deal, but late game, that can cost you a match. Not that I care about winning that much, it\u2019s just frustrating. Especially since the PS5 is supposed to be a beast when it comes to frames. \n\nI tend to notice it most when I or another player close is using the slurp cannon late game, and when a bunch of wooden builds catch on fire. But it happens occasionally without these things too. \n\nI haven\u2019t changed anything settings wise, and I\u2019ve really only noticed it this season. If anyone has any tips that might fix this, they would be greatly appreciated. If not, hopefully someone at Epic sees this and can fix this. Maybe it has something to do with the PS5 fan. Back in like Chapter 2 Season 5, the game ran consistently, but the fan on the PS5 was really loud. Now I don\u2019t hear the fan, but my frames are anything but consistent. I\u2019d rather have a loud fan than inconsistent frames. Maybe something else is wrong, I don\u2019t know, but thank you for your time."

If I\u2019ve had enough experience or can read the room, I can do this very quickly. Then that info is weighted according to logical framework (Ti) or values (Fi).

The ex chief scientist of Pfizer, Dr Michael Yeadon, said these vaccines are a depopulation tool and those who have taken them will die within 2 years. He is an authorative figure with qualifications and years of experience and official ties to one of the leading vaccine companies, but I am not climbing on his back to substantiate my points.  \n\n\nI posted several sources, most of them scientific literature.

You have no knowledge of your own and didn't even know the spike protein was present in the vaccine. You injected yourself with this poison without looking at the ingredients.

Nothing safe about it, it is a pathogen, it directly binds to ACE2 which turns on our inflammatory response and increases intracellular calcium.

Don't really understand how a demand for a specific price of a stock is reached by consensus from individuals who can't decide on anything.\n\nThanks for answering my dumb question (even though I can't appear to see any of the replies on my phone)--I guess set your limit sales at 1000$ if that is the goal. So I've done my part; Buy, set limit at 1k and walk away.\n\nThe synopsis was pretty much what is to be expected. Supply and demand, but the supply is below a demand of 1000. There just needs to be less supply below 1000$.\n\nI was told there was supposed to be blackjack here. \n\nI think it goes without saying I'm not a financial advisor and if I were yours... \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80?"

Eventually they get their hands on the sigil, and since they worship the same goddess as the cleric, I figure \u201cwhy not?\u201d, and let them attune to it.\n\nThe stat boost buffs them up a bit giving them 20s in both dex and wis, but it\u2019s fine - the combat section of my campaign is super challenging, and it\u2019s not like the other characters are by any means weak. The issue is that the character just isn\u2019t treating the sigil with proper care, even giving it to an obviously evil enemy as an attempt to appease it and recovering it after the enemy gets killed.\n\nI don\u2019t want to make him feel like shit for losing his new toy (that also lets him take a bunch of feats instead of ASIs) but I also don\u2019t want to just leave it.

My internship was boring to me but I also did a good it of fluff in that role, but in general it wasn't that stimulating. \n\nFor option 1: the pay is 77k, 35 hour work weeks, remote and I met some of the people and liked them. I'm not sure if I'll be bored or if the job would be a good way to start my career/provide other opportunities in the future. This company is known for having a strong work life balance, and would give me free time (which I haven't really had throughout my degree)\n\nFor option 2: the pay is 95k, and I would need to relocate, +5k sign on bonus, +5k relocation. I know from school I like working with embedded and fpgas. This company is huge so they don't even know what project I'd be working on. So I have no idea the extent of the hours but it's at least 40 per week. Since I don't know the project or therefore the exact place I'd relocate to it's more of a shot in the dark. Reviews on Glassdoor generally said the work was interesting.\n\nI'm leaning towards the first job mostly for the work life balance and lack of relocating. But I'm conflicted and not sure what opportunities it will lead me to. If I relocate I'd probably move for 18 months then move back. I'm more of an introvert so with relocating I'm slightly worried about being too isolated or struggling to meet people if I work extreme hours.\n\n\nAny advice would be appreciated\nP.S. Would it be hard for me to get back to comp engineering after a 1 year web dev role?"

Val from the Duke of Sin was honestly rather perfect. Any situation where the mmc is using his position of power agains the fmc is also delicious. Even more so if the Fmc activity fights him back on it and calls him on all his bullshit. Bonus points if theres non con/dub con and/or low to no groveling. I want my men problematic, clearly. \n\nAs far as the audio books go, im not all that picky so long a sI can understand what the person is saying.

I can't swim, so characters that are swimming all the time I just can not relate to for whatever reason. I end up DNFing any book where the FMC turns out to be some how affliated with water because of it.\n\nConversely, I absolutely LOATHE plus size romances. The very moment a characters weight is mentioned to be heavy in some way, I just lose any and all interest in the book. Because it just keeps reminding me that I, like the main character, is over weight. And frankly the body positivity I have seen in such books is distracting. I dont want to think about my body when I'm reading.\n\nOther things Im less strict on, but I'll still have the weird dichotomy that I have trouble looking passed. Is she extremely sexually experienced or uses her sexuality to manipulate others? I can read it but Im still not going to be able to relate to her at all. Is she autistic?

However, you\u2019re the only one who know the truth, no test is perfect. So Just observe yourself and my definition will guide you to your real type.\n\n\n\nStep One: Understand the basic meaning of cognitive functions.\n\nIntroverted Thinking (Ti) - Analyzing/Defining/Logical precision\n\nExtroverted Thinking (Te) - Organizing/Efficiency/Standardization\n\nIntroverted Intuition (Ni) - Vision/Foreseeing/Perspective\n\nExtroverted Intuition (Ne) - Explore meaning/Speculation/Possibilities\n\nIntroverted Feeling (Fi) - Authenticity/Identity/Self morality\n\nExtroverted Feeling (Fe) - Harmony/Empathy/Someone else's value\n\nIntroverted Sensing (Si) - Reviewing/Comparing/Stabilizing\n\nExtroverted Sensing (Se) - Sensation/Experiencing/Noticing physical change\n\n\n\nStep Two: Pick the answer for each function type that would accurately describe you.\n\nJudging function\n\na)Ti and Fe  b)Te and Fi\n\nPerceiving function\n\na)Ni and Se  b)Ne and Si\n\n\n\nStep Three: Which one you focus and invest your energy/attention the most? Compare yourself when socializing and being alone.\n\nExtrovert) Surrounding. People. Social. World. News.\n\nIntrovert) Past experience/knowledge. Your thought/feeling/future/perspective/imagination.\n\n\n\nStep Four: Assign role to each function. For two choices you made in step two, one choice contains your Dominant and Inferior function, another contains Parent and Child function. Decide and place these four functions in the specific order \u201cDominant-Parent-Child-Inferior\u201d. Make sure no introverted or extroverted function is next to each other. (Note: answer in step three suggests the type of your dominant and child function)\n\n\n\nDominant - Literally you. The way you live your life. Everything depends on it.\n\nParent - Self supervisor. Your mental parent.\n\nChild - The source of your childish behavior. Your nature/uniqueness.\n\nInferior - Weakness. Fear. The reason you feel uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nStep Five: Search the result and done!"

Often when I see or meet someone I find attractive I get filled with this feeling like I need to have her. I can't ignore it properly, it's a very strong pull that makes me want to have sex with them. It's a very similar to the problem I had with drugs, it's hard to say no. Television can also trigger that.\n\nI hate this because it makes me easily objectify women. But in some ways it's also more than that. I think I'm similarily fascinated by the thought of finding out how different people would connect with me when there's nothing to separate us. It's curiosity about the mind and body of other perso  connecting with me. What they('re) like and how their personality changes in that setting, it's almost a spiritual feeling sometimes.\n\nI cheated on her a couple of months back and felt bad about it. But at the same time I felt a big relief and it improved our sex life too (while fucking up other aspects in the relationship; the trust went down the window). However, now I feel like the tension is building up inside me again and I don't know what to do. I've thought about breaking up with her not to hurt her anymore but that'd also end up in tears."

Of course the Democratic party has a tendency to only root for old useless hacks like Biden, Muskie and Humphrey and in the end no one is happy.\n\nSo now my question is, where to continue with Hunter's works? The Great Shark Hunt covered Jimmy Carter a little, but is there any book focusing in the 80's politics? Geneartion of Swine? Was that the book where Hunter was covering the Bush campaign?"

If someone just dumps their issues on me, I know that they don't care if I'm ready to listen to them or if I'm emotionally ok with hearing something potentially unsettling. And on the other side, having good communication if I want to vent to someone and make sure it is completely up to them if I share or not. When someone vents to you without asking or without showing signs of being willing to listen to you, it closes you off and keeps you from being vulnerable to them. Learning to very clearly say \"hey, do you have a moment for me to tell you something?\" or something similar shows that you care about the other person's time and emotional well being, and that you want them listening to be voluntary and not forced. It took being friends with someone who expected me to listen to all of their issues without giving a crap how I was doing to really realize how much communication is important. I hate small talk, but even asking people \"how was your day?\" Or \"how are you?\" Shows that you care about their well being and are open to listening. Putting all of this into practice has allowed me to have much healthier friendships and find people who I feel open sharing with.",

Even if people aren't being intentionally manipulative, sometimes they get so caught up in their own issues and emotions that they don't realize they aren't the only person with problems and end up asking too much of people. One good way to figure out if someone is being too needy is by putting yourself in their shoes and asking yourself \"Would I ask someone to do this for me?\" And the response is usually \"No, I would feel bad for asking because of __ reason\" surprisingly frequently. Of course this is kind of subjective, but I guess just view it from \"I wouldn't ask someone else to do this, so maybe I should reconsider doing this for them.\"",

That will just make its members more convinced that they're being persecuted. Its members need to be deradicalized. \n\nI wonder if there's a way to get to them within their own communities. Like, I remember watching that Faraday Speaks video where the dude talked about getting out of the alt-right. He mentioned that he was able to relate to Natalie, and that really helped him.\n\nI wonder what the equivalent would be for Qanon. \n\nThe impression I get is that Qanon is mostly comprised of older people who think that they're tech savvy. They're tired of being ignored, and they're tired of being told that they're stupid and out of touch. One of their friends introduces them to this idea, that they, the supposedly ignorant, out of touch people, know something that everyone else doesn't know. And it's intoxicating, and everyone around them is in it, and it feels so empowering. \n\nAnd of course, all the while, they're being indoctrinated into a cult that believes that Kamala Harris and Tom Hanks get together on the weekends to drink the blood and adrenaline of murdered children, and that Donald Trump, upright moral man that he is, is the only one who can save the country.\n\nMy question is, who can reach these people? Who can they relate to? What is the right approach to getting a group of older, presumably Christian, presumably white, presumably unhappy people to stop drinking the kool-aid?\n\nHere are some notes on what I'm thinking:\n\n**An appeal to pathos.**\n\nPros:\n\n\\-These people are, by in large, driven by pathos in the first place.\n\n\\-I don't think a bout of polemic logic would impress them the same way that it impressed Faraday Speaks\u2014they don't think of themselves as intellectuals the same way your Sargons of Akkad might.\n\n\\-I might be able to think up some Christian themed appeals to pathos, as a Christian myself.\n\nCons:\n\n\\-I suspect that, for many Qanon supporters, nothing can be as emotionally powerful as Qanon. It might be hard to drown that out.\n\n**Some sort of widely disseminated media literacy turorial.**\n\nPros:\n\n\\-As I mentioned earlier, these people tend to think of themselves as tech savvy, but they've been sucked into believing YouTube videos and Facebook posts over peer-reviewed news sources. Like, they've even turned on Fox at this point. A basic course on spotting the difference between fact, inference, and judgement, even, could go a long way towards helping them realize that the sources they follow are very biased. Awakening their true, individual critical thinking would be quite effective, I think.\n\nCons:\n\n\\-I'm kind of making assumptions here, but I think that there's a long, proud tradition among older people centered around refusing to adapt to new technology. It might be hard to break that.\n\n\\-It might be difficult to convince them to trust any source outside of the Qanon bubble, like a free, online media literacy course. Then again, this could turn into a pro if the media literacy course was secretly embedded into Qanon itself...like, some sort of Qanony video explaining how important it is for individuals to question the community around them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThose are the ideas that immediately occurred to me. Anybody else here have different ideas about deradicalizing Qanon?\n\ntl;dr: I'm looking for ideas on how to deradicalize Qanon, because it needs to be done."

I'm a first year music education student, as well as a prospective composer, so I want to work this out.\n\nI don't like \"contemporary classical.\" I appreciate its existence, and its complexity. I appreciate that it's somewhat of an acquired taste. And I do like some of it\u2014I just recently played the cello part for Glass's 2017 piano concerto, and it was lovely. But in general, I find anything that is not tonal banal to listen to, no matter how academically interesting.\n\nAnd I don't think I'm alone in this. People may look down on someone like me, one who does not yet have the requisite skill and background to appreciate strange, contemporary work. But just look at this subreddit, as well as the music world in general. It's all about Bach, and Fanny Mendelssohn (a particular favorite of mine), and Mozart and Debussy and Mahler. Conductors sandwich new work in between old favorites like medicine, just to keep the audience in the concert hall for the duration.\n\nNow, this isn't to say that I think that strange, contemporary music should be shunned. It definitely has its place, and I'm sure that I'll someday learn to appreciate it. But I do *not* want to write it. I certainly don't want to give it to a bunch of high schoolers in a few years\u2014I'd like them to enjoy my class.\n\nIs there any room left in the world of composition for tunes you can hum? Or is modern tonal work shunned as unoriginal?"

The cerave cream leaves like a film on top of my skin and makes it feel like uhh cracked? I don't know how to describe it my my skin is uncomfortable. When i smile or something i feel like my skin is going to rip and I can see every single face line yet when I touch my face it feels soft. It's weird. Please help, my skin feels uncomfortable. Oh, I also use Vaseline at night to help but when I wake up it also feels dry and pulled from the inside. \nI used to add a few drops of glycerine and it kinda helped but then I stopped.\n\n(I don't use face powder or any makeup on my skin, nothing, just blush and highlighter)"

Us IWC fans try to micro analyze whether the booking was set up right too much that it interferes with just being able to enjoy what we see in front of us. If the guy was leaving and for some reason they had to hurry it up, it's going to be impossible to get a perfectly satisfying final stretch. And the match with him giving someone the rub on the way out doesn't have to be the last match.

All the people who prefer pro wrestling over basketball & who were interested in purchasing the ppv are simply going to do it anyway like they always were. This decision does nothing to change the outcome of their choice to buy it. However for the people who may like pro wrestling but prefer basketball, knowing that they may be forced to make a decision between a potentially tight fourth quarter and the main event of a pay-per-view would most likely lead to them simply not buying the pay-per-view because it's not worth spending the money with risk. \n\nThose who already decided on purchasing it will remain unaffected and their money will be locked in. However, those who are undecided based on the premise of not wanting to make a choice between the pay-per-view & the NBA will now have the option to choose to buy because they know they'll at least see the main event without conflict. Too many people are trying to analyze it from the perspective of someone who's already decided they want to buy it. But this decision is not meant for you because your money is already accounted for. \n\nEven if 10 people are swayed to purchase the pay-per-view because of this, that's a net positive of 10 buys because there's no potential to lose purchases due to this. It's also a good opportunity together data on how many extra sales they might make for demographic and market analysis of their product period\n\nTLDR: any business decision that only has potential for a net increase in purchases with 0 potential for people canceling purchase is ultimately a good business decision."

I could tell I wouldn't have had the same success that I had against bosses like Champ Gundyr & Nameless King if I had to use melee.\n\nI played Demon Souls remake after and found that mage was even more OP compared to DS3 where it was still pretty hard especially early game. I decided to try Bloodborne after and it was just kicking my ass. The ideas of being in an enemies face & God forbid parrying where so alien to my previous play styles. Bloodborne Fd me up but by the time I beat it, I finally felt like I had actual control over these games. \n\nI went back and replayed DS3 & Demon Souls as well as played DS1 using melee and felt like a completely new player.\nNow playing a Quality build in Elden Ring is amazing (I still love magic but respecced out of a mage right before Morgott) but if I hadn't played Bloodborne I don't think I would have ever gotten confident with the melee mechanics like this. Bloodborne is the best \"Git Gud\" coach FS made imo (haven't played Sekiro or DS2 yet). \n\nTLDR: It wasn't until my 3rd FS game, Bloodborne, that I actually felt like I knew wtf I was doing and was comfortable in fire fights."

I guarantee that if you become purposeful in drinking water and start getting over 64ozs a day and you get 7 hours of quality sleep regularly, you'll notice changes in a months time that remain for good even as well as you age. Of course sleep is highly lifestyle dependant since we might have jobs & kids, but if you find a way to prioritize sleep hygiene it will immensely benefit your regular hygiene. And water is just critical for anything. You want to lose weight? You want to gain weight? You want more energy? You want to relax more? Water is seriously a boost to every single goal possible.\n\nThought these reminders would be worthwhile since I still have to remind myself often as well. Stay hydrated brothers."

If that is indeed the case, does anyone have any recommendations as to what dental insurance would be best for this situation (i.e., lowest out-of-pocket costs, availability of periodontists, etc.)?\n\nBackground: I live in Sacramento (Midtown), and am currently on the DeltaCare USA HMO. I have been with the State for 6.5 years, so I am eligible to switch to a PPO if necessary, or can switch to another HMO. I don't have any other immediate dental needs; I got my first two cavities in my entire life last year (I'm in my early 30s), and hopefully I won't be hit with a bunch of expensive cavities at once.\n\nIf I can provide any additional information that would allow for a more solid recommendation, please let me know. In the meantime, I've contacted my dentist requesting to be seen as soon as possible. Open Enrollment is (thankfully) coming up, so I'd like to try to be prepared.\n\nThank you! \ud83d\ude2c\n\nUpdate: Thank you all for thr advice. My gum pain ended up subsiding almost completely by the time I saw my dentist on Monday. He couldn't find anything wrong, and told me to lay off the hydrogen peroxide \ud83d\ude05. I'm still considering going ahead and switching to the PPO."

And we\u2019ve agreed to go no contact until our 3 year anniversary on may 20th.\n\nThe reason for our breakup was that she asked me for the 800th time in our relationship why I love her and I said something really foolish and inappropriate for the time being but I did not mean for it to be taken seriously, which was:\n\n \u201cyou make my d*** hard\u201d \n\nI was trying to be funny and it of course backfired on me tremendously. And it lead to a breakup right then and there. I tried to salvage the situation and tell her serious reasons but she did not really want to hear it.\n\nShe constantly asks me why I love her and I try to always find a unique reason why because I don\u2019t like being repetitive but it just doesn\u2019t seem to be enough for her.\n\nIt\u2019s like every time she asks that question she forgets I ever genuinely answered it in the first place. Everything I do that doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem in the moment is used as ammunition in whatever upcoming disagreement we may have, And the mistakes that are addressed are accounted for and an apology is made.\n\nI tell her all the time that she\u2019s the final piece to my puzzle and I enjoy her companionship more than anything. I literally enjoy everything we do together.\n\nI do forget things in the relationship and mix up dates but I try to explain to her that I have level 1 Autism and ADHD so that will happen often and it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t love her. I try to explain to her that my brain just simply doesn\u2019t work like everyone else\u2019s. \n\nHonestly off of pure gut instinct, it seems like she\u2019s trying to find reasons that we\u2019ll fail at this point and it may be a complete lost cause. But I\u2019m going to honor the no contact until our anniversary and see what happens I guess. \n\nShe\u2019s playing hot and cold it seems like. If I check my messages I could see that some of them say delivered which means she\u2019s unblocked me a few times in between. I don\u2019t know why honestly, when we talk its through no caller ID.\n\nLast time we talked I of course confessed my love to her and all the reasons I love her and said that if this is the only thing holding us back then I want to work on it. She said she\u2019ll think about it and take it into consideration.\n\nI honestly can\u2019t tell if this is the relationship dealbreaker or if she\u2019s just trying to let me down easy at this point, that\u2019s the confusing part."

Even silly things like I changed my favourite colour. I know there are to bad consequences, but my brain fears loss of control and change so much that I\u2019m afraid of shifting the norm even slightly.\n\nWhich makes dating super hard. Everytime I like someone, and I flirt with them I\u2019m okay \u2014 nothings changed. Then they ask me out; something that should make me happy. I get a really bad anxiety attack that can last until I reject them. So far the farthest I made it was one date. I only got that far cuz I new I would back out so I impulsively said yes over text. That night was super nice but right after I avoided my family all day felt nauseas. \n\nI thought maybe in a year when I move out it will be better cuz I don\u2019t feel like u have to keep my parents updated on everything or at least I\u2019ll feel like an adult and supposed to date, but that\u2019s probably just wishful thinking. \n\nI hate this so much.

My sister played High School Musical and Rent all the damn time when I was a kid and, in my little kid head, I thought that all music was We\u2019re All in This Together and Seasons of Love. I don\u2019t even hate them now, it just annoyed the hell out of me after hearing them a hundred times over. \n\nI had my little anti-music rebel phase for maybe a couple of years. I supplemented music with books and a fuck ton of Nickelodeon. It wasn\u2019t until my brother showed me Mockingbird by Eminem and Over by Drake that I started to like music again, and it wasn\u2019t until he showed me The Worst Guys that I was finally a fan of an artist. I didn\u2019t really get the concept of an album, or maybe I was just too hyperactive to sit down and listen to an entire project through, but I listened to exclusively that song for months. You were the very first artist I\u2019ve ever called myself a fan of, and Chance was the second. I eventually found your music videos and delighted in Bonfire, Heartbeat, Sweatpants, Firefly, and 3005. I remember going on a walk with my mom and stepdad, walking ahead with my headphones, and listening to Heartbeat on repeat for, like, an hour.\n\nAt some point I finally jumped into because the internet. But I\u2019ve never jumped into something casually. I wanted to get everything I could out of it, see and know every last bit of it I possibly could. I read the screenplay, watched clapping for the wrong reasons, listened to the album a million times, watched every interview I could, then went to school the next day like a damn missionary trying to tell everyone who you were and why they should check you out. I\u2019d never been so amazed. I can vividly recall middle school conversations, vehemently arguing that bti was the best album of all time. I listened to Camp next and dived into the mixtapes. I was hooked. You dropped STN MTN when I was in 7th grade and obsessed with Destiny, I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve listened to the Partna Dem verse cause I\u2019d replay that shit over and over again. \n\nWhen you dropped AML and I heard Have Some Love and Stand Tall for the first time, man. My freshman and sophomore years were really rough. A lot of depression, a lot of self-harm, a lot of toxic friendships, a lot of family members passing away. Stand Tall just hit different. But Redbone blew up and I was so happy for you, same with TIA. I\u2019ve seen you live just once and it was the Houston concert on the TIA tour. You walked right past me and my brother after you sang Stand Tall at the top of our section. You said it was church and you didn\u2019t lie.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is such a long winded post. I\u2019m just reflecting on the past six or seven years. I\u2019m almost 18 and one of the only constants for me through my teens has been you and your music. When my grandpa died, you were there and I sank away into your music. Your music helped me battle my depression and cutting. Your music has shaped me for the better part of a decade and the better part of my recallable life. I\u2019ve followed you for this long and I\u2019ll follow you in whatever you do in the future. I\u2019ll always be a fan. I can\u2019t understate the impact that you\u2019ve had on me and that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had on so many people in this sub.\n\nIf this is really the end of Gambino, I\u2019m proud of you. Be an amazing father and be there for your family. Follow whatever creative pursuits your heart desires. It\u2019s been an amazing ride. \n\nLove, Cameron"

I don't mean it to relate to politics (unless you're a strict determinist, I doubt you'd claim all stories are political?) and I don't understand your definitions. So far, you have claimed that photography is a mute, static, and visual medium, and somewhere in those descriptors are attributes that oppose that of attributes required for storytelling. You concede that films do tell stories. You also claim that photos rely on a viewer's subjective relation to context, which might not necessarily tell the story intended. \n\nMute and visual: I think these are rather easy to ignore. Books tell stories and are mute and visual, and silent films tell stories. I don't think a story requires sound, or visuals. \n\nStatic: This is what requires the most work thinking through (although, I don't think much). \nFirstly, what do you mean by dynamic? You say a film is dynamic: is it because the picture is changing that makes it so? I'd assume so. I guess, in your world, this makes books dynamic because the words change? Only, they don't change, they just sit there on the page and rely on the viewer's movement of the eye and understanding of words to make sense of a story that isn't necessarily cut and dry literal - some stories encourage or even demand interpretation. Similarly with pictures, photographers intentionally place elements in a scene for your eye to follow and make sense of using your own understanding of the elements and the context. Some pictures showcase less evident stories (and their story might simply just be a feeling or emotion), but I think it's pretty hard to deny the existence of stories in some pictures. I cite again the comedy wildlife awards, go and have a look at them if you haven't seen them! If 99% of people reach the same conclusion about the story that a photographer is trying to tell, then has the photographer told a story, or have people just arbitrarily created their own story in their head? \n\nPhotos are dynamic - your eye has to travel somewhere! \n\nIf you're still paying attention to these comments I'd love to hear a response. Like I said before, I'm thankful you sent me the article. It was very interesting. \n\nI still believe however that photography is a storytelling medium and the better you are at it, the better photographer you will likely become.",

                "body": "Sorry to add another comment here, but do you live your life so literally that you can't see a metaphor in anything? As photographers, who show images to people, you want to evoke an emotion, and have people dream up contextual devices to make sense of the photos you take. Most of the time, good photographers will be able to control how people navigate the context through the composition of the photo. Perhaps the story will be simple movement of the eye from one element to the next, or maybe it will be found in the way the actual elements interact (take a photo of a squished up tennis ball after being hit, perhaps we can infer that it was hit rather hard by a presumably good athlete). \nThe advice is for people who want their photographs to connect with others, and to understand it. A compositionally illiterate photograph most of the time does not connect with people, and if it does, it's because there is a prevalent story being told. \nI need to rant some more about your lack of understanding about this talking point! \n\nWhat on earth do you consider a story-telling medium to be? Since, according to you, photos are reliant on viewers to come up with their own stuff. Surely a film is a story-telling medium, and yet, by your standards, it can't tell stories because they need a reading of it by a viewer. I mean, most people will come to the same conclusions of the story, in most films, but we can't accept any responsibility from the film for any such conclusions, as it is only our obscure and detached reading of them that attaches a story to it. After all, films are only visual mediums with sound. Or is it the sound that makes the difference to you? Given you said that photos are only a 'mute visual medium'. Do you think a story requires sound, or simply no visuals, or maybe both to be story? I guess that checks silent films off the story-telling mediums list. \n\nPictures that we show people need to evoke an emotion, otherwise people won't look at our pictures more than once. This is what telling a story is about.",

I think you have it in your head that when people say: 'try and tell a story', they mean have a complex subject matter, or at least many elements of a scene that tie into eachother. \nThis is not my understanding of telling a story. Like you said, photographing the woman you love doesn't have to please anyone, and it's important that it isn't your aim when you do that. However, I think it will still nonetheless be worthwhile to tell a story in that photograph, because that's what people intrinsically desire from a photograph! \nFor example, if your wife's looking happy, she has a nice smile, and you capture it - you've told a story. Maybe it's not so apparent to others what this story is, but you'll remember why she was smiling, and what was happening. That's why you like the picture! \nIf you had captured her in a mood, or simply mood-less, you might enjoy the picture less so, because the story is less apparent to you, or you might not like the story being told.\nPictures in books are simply stories that are easier to decipher for most people - take the comedy wildlife awards - they're all simple yet fantastic photographs because they tell stories that people can connect with.\nI think your actual problem is not with telling stories, but feeling a pressure to tell a story for other people, and not yourself. I'd re-evaluate the message to say: 'have your pictures tell stories that you enjoy'. If taking a picture of a fly is meaningless to you, don't do it, but if you are endlessly moved by the scene of the fly on the windowsill, aim to capture it as best you can so you can convey the emotions felt at that moment. That's what telling a story is actually about.",

The headaches have been bothering me a lot these past few days and I'm not sure how much it has to do with lack of sleep as well, but I know I don't like the feeling of touching my scalp. There's probably 5 of them, a few fairly big and a few small ones just kinda scattered. I also have psoriasis and had a lot of impetigo as a kid but idk how relevant that is.

My situation makes it then hard to make friends.\n\nI have friends here though, but no one is very close. I don't know how to open up. I also feel that when I become energic and open up, no one shares my burst or really care at all... no one shares my energy, or really share no interest in it.\n\n\nWhat can I do to make more friends? And how can I dare to be more energic as I want to be?\n\nThanks for answers in advance! English is not my native language, so  if I am not understandable, please tell me :)"

In two days I got an exam where I am to play the piano in front of my teachers and get a grade. Some of the pieces I am going to play are alone, but some are in groups.\n\nOur class got a lecture once a week where we are divided into groups and play a song together which will be graded later. One of those groups I was put together with played an awsome song which I will play with them at my upcoming exam. Unfortunately the groups consists of people who respond to ehat they want to respond to, which means I will sometimes will get left on read (, even if I asked them a question).\n\nThree weeks ago, we went trough the song together, but because of a mix up we shouldn't practice for long and we didn't hve one of our band members. We decided to practice two weeks from then (last week), and I would text them. Tuesday morning I sent them a text, asking if they could practice the lunch at Friday. After some talking, we ended the conversation because the two people out of five which responded couldn't or didn't answer. \nWednesday morning I asked if everyone was available next week (this week) Monday or Tuesday, which nobody responded to. I asked again just with Monday a few hours later, no response.\n\nFriday morning, I had a class with my piano teacher and complained to him about the lack of response (or response with only declining my offer). He asked me to put me in the groupchat, so he could ask them also. I decided rather to send them a text stating:\n\"Hi,\nIt would be nice if you could respond when you are able to practice. My exam will be next week on Wednesday at 12:00.\"\n(No emojis like earlier texts)\n\nOne who also tend to use emojis responded with\n\" we will fix it on Monday!\"\n\nNo response after that from nobody. Today I sent a reminder, which no one responded to. I grew tired and invited my pianoteacher into the group who said \n\" remember to practice today :)\"\nThe same person from before responded\n\" we will. Meet you at (...)\"\n\nI feel like a kind of asshole since they all volunteered to play at my exam, but it does require practice.. we are nowhere near finished. So, AITA?\n\nBtw:\nI wrote this in a hurry, and English isn't my first language. Please tell if I need to rewrite something which is not understandable :)\n\n\nEdit:\n\nTDLR: I have been asking my band to practice for a long time but they don't give a valuable respond other than declining. My teacher asked me to add him and I did, but the group doesn't seem so fund of me"

You didn't remember my name, I remembered yours.\n\nMonths pass. We get to know each other. Every day, I wake up to remember your green eyes behind your round glasses, the way your eyebrows move up when you laugh (because of the virus, I barely saw you laugh or smile, for that matter). We work together on projects. We make a great team.\n\nThen one day, everything felt too much. I tell you I have feelings for you. You're overwhelmed. You say that you don't know how your life will change if we got together. That question haunted my brain ever since you pronounced it.\n\nTwo days later, you say you feel the same as I do. I believe you. That's the day we start dating.\n\nFrom that moment, I grab your hand, I hug you, I kiss you on the cheek, I give you my full undivided attention, and it somehow doesn't feel right.\n\nWhen I grab your hand, touch your hair, I feel like I make you feel uncomfortable. Your hand gets cold, you begin to tremble, as if you didn't want me there.\n\nAt the same time, I feel your calm gaze from across the room and I feel your heart racing when your eyes lock into mine, promising me that you are indeed mine.\n\nBut is it true? That you can feel things for me without accepting my love, that you want me to be there when your body says no, that the things you say matter more than the things you initiate?\n\nSo I try to love you differently. I try to love you like your body wants to be loved. I back away. I listen more. I initiate contact only when I am absolutely sure you want to, terrified to break your personal boundaries, despite you saying that I can.\n\nI don't know how to love you. It now feels like we're back to friends despite, well, everything that we feel. I just don't know how to love you in a way that feels just right, because everything just seems off, and I have no clue what.\n\nI tried to talk to you. You didn't know what I was talking about.\n\nSo I am going to give us time. Time to be and reflect. Maybe after I will know what to do. Love takes time and patience, but I don't know if it's worth it to make things painful for now.\n\nI really hope I will be able to love you like you deserve and how you need, but for now, I don't know how to love you like I should... \n\n-S"

Hinter \"Gold\" ist aber noch was gekrakelt, und das erste Wort in der zweiten Zeile d\u00fcrfte \"stark\" statt \"steif\" sein. Kleine Abwandlung, der Spruch ist es aber definitiv. Das dritte Wort in Zeile 2 sieht komischerweise auch aus wie \"aber\".\n\nDie f\u00fcnfte Zeile ist eine Widmung: \"Zum (...) Dein (...)\". Das zweite Wort k\u00f6nnte mit viel Fantasie \"Studium\" sein, aber beim letzten, also dem Namen, bin ich komplett lost.\n\nHab's \u00fcbrigens rausgefunden, da ich das Wort \"Felsenstein\" ganz klar erkannt hab. Gibt wohl nur wenig Lyrik, die dieses Wort enth\u00e4lt, denn Google hat gleich diesen Spruch ausgespuckt. Hoffe das hilft einigerma\u00dfen :D",

If this is true, what do you think these two remaining scenes will show?\n\nMy guess for the Jesse scene would be something around the time of the BrBa episodes \"Confessions\"/\"Rabid Dog\". Jesse went all ballistic on Saul because of his aid in poisoning Brock, which seriously scared Saul, to the point where he started wearing a bulletproof vest, and actively considered his own use of the vacuum cleaner service. Poisoning Brock could also be a parallel to drugging the guy with cancer we saw in last week's episode.\n\nThe Walt scene may be an extension of what we have already seen of Walt and Saul being bunkmates in Ed's basement, that's my best guess at least.\n\nAnyway, I'm not sure about any of this, so I'm curious what you think. I trust the writers to be a bit more creative than I am.\n\nPS: I made some cinnamon/hazelnut rolls in preparation for tonight's episode (no Cinnabon in my country sadly), and wanted to show them off :D The hype is real.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7r8n74zppjg91.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f3fe8a6fdd9c98821426a9095903b2401467f6e"

Also sprecht mir nach, liebe Klasse: Wus-ter-scher. WUS-TER-SCHER. **WUS. TER. SCHER.**\n\nDa das jetzt gekl\u00e4rt ist, kurz zu mir: Ich LIEBE verfickt noch mal Worcestershiresauce. Kipp das Zeug auf was Essbares, und es wird automatisch g\u00f6ttlich. Saucen, Suppen, Eint\u00f6pfe, Marinaden, Nudeln, Tofu, R\u00fchrei, Fleisch und Fisch f\u00fcr die Omni-Freunde, V\u00d6LLIG EGAL. Selbst in 'ne Bloody Mary kommt ein Schuss davon rein, und macht diese dadurch erst zum perfekten Kater-Drink. Was dem Saarl\u00e4nder sein Maggi, ist mir meine Worcestershiresauce (Maggi mag ich \u00fcbrigens nicht besonders, kauf ich auch nicht, weil Nestl\u00e9). Ich w\u00fcrde mir die Pl\u00f6rre literweise in den Rachen sch\u00fctten, wenn man danach nicht 'ne halbe Packung Rennie fressen m\u00fcsste, um das schei\u00df Sodbrennen loszuwerden. Es ist sogar das einzige, wobei ich als Gr\u00fcnfutter-fressender Soja-Lappen eine Ausnahme mache, wenn die Veggie-Variante mal vergriffen ist.\n\nABER WARUM IST DIE SAUCE SO UNFASSBAR GEIL?  \nSie ist eine makellose M\u00e9lange aus allen relevanten Geschmacksnuancen. Sie ist salzig, s\u00fc\u00df, scharf und s\u00e4uerlich zugleich, aber vor allem hammerm\u00e4\u00dfig gew\u00fcrzt und tief UMAMI. Dieses geile, fleischige, speichelflussanregende, weswegen von der Lebensmittelindustrie bis zum Chinarestaurant um die Ecke alle massenhaft MSG und Hefeextrakt in ihre Fressalien kippen, damit man immer mehr von allem in sich hineinstopfen will.\n\nWIE WIRD DIESES TIEFE AROMA ERREICHT?  \nDie original Worcestershiresauce stammt von Lea & Perrins, in, ihr habt richtig geraten, Worcester, Grafschaft Worcestershire, England. Sie entstand einer Legende nach per Zufall, als irgendein Lord ein Rezept aus Indien mitbrachte und in der Drogerie von L&P zubereiten lie\u00df. Es schmeckte relativ schei\u00dfe, also wurde das Fass mit der Sauce kurzerhand in den Keller verfrachtet und dort vergessen. Nach einem halben Jahr wurde es wieder ge\u00f6ffnet, und siehe da, es war ein G\u00f6ttertrunk entstanden. Soweit die Legende.  \nL&P wurde 2005 von Heinz \u00fcbernommen, aber sie stellen die Sauce immer noch nach gleichem Rezept her. Heinz hat dagegen eine eigene Sauce unter eigenem Namen, die \u00e4hnlich, aber nicht gleich schmeckt. Eigentlich eine gute L\u00f6sung.  \nDie heute bekannte Sauce von L&P besteht aus Essig, Melasse, Zucker, Salz, Sardellen, Tamarinden-Extrakt, Zwiebeln, Knoblauch, und verschiedenen Gew\u00fcrzen. Diese Mischung wird \u00fcber mindestens 18 Monate im Fass fermentiert. FERMENTIERT! Das Zeug reift tats\u00e4chlich, wie ein guter Wein oder Whisky! Das gleiche passiert auch z.B. mit Tabasco-Sauce. Und ich sag euch eines: Nur etwas, was im Fass gelagert wurde, kann eure Zunge zu derart ekstatischen, gaumenz\u00e4pfchenersch\u00fctternden, ja geradezu obsz\u00f6nen Geschmacksorgasmen bringen.  \n\n\nWARUM JETZT ALSO DIE TIRADE?  \nMan denkt zun\u00e4chst vielleicht, der Begriff \"Worcestershire Sauce\" sei EU-rechtlich als Herkunftsangabe gesch\u00fctzt. Ist ja auch der Fall bei etwa Parmiggiano Reggiano oder Th\u00fcringer Leberwurst. HAHAHAHA, VON WEGEN! JEDER DARF **DEN RANZIGSTEN SCHEI\u1e9e** IN 'NE FLASCHE ABF\u00dcLLEN UND ES WORCESTERSHIRESAUCE (oder auch nur Worcestersauce) NENNEN, SOLANGE DER LEBENSMITTEL-KONTROLL\u00d6RRES NIX ZU BEANSTANDEN HAT! SOLANGE DIE SIFFBR\u00dcHE SCH\u00d6N BRAUN IST, MERKT JA KEINER DEN UNTERSCHIED!  \nOh doch. ICH merke ihn.  \nWas in Deutschland gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils als Worcestershiresauce verkauft wird, ist eine einzige Blamage. Ein Skandal. Eine Travestie. Ich w\u00fcrde es sogar ein kulturelles Verbrechen nennen, besonders, da die englische K\u00fcche nicht gerade viele Kulturg\u00fcter vorzuweisen hat. Deshalb ist es die PFLICHT eines jeden Einzelnen, diese Kleinstmenge an kulinarischen Errungenschaften, wie etwa Minzsauce, Cheddar, oder eben Worcestershiresauce, entsprechend zu w\u00fcrdigen und vor jedweder ungerechtfertigten Verst\u00fcmmelung zu bewahren.  \nGro\u00dfe deutsche \"Fein\"-Kostfirmen wie Dittmann, Kattus, Appel oder Altenburger dagegen haben sich mit ihrem Zerrbild dessen, was sie f\u00fcr eine authentische Worcestershiresauce halten, ein derma\u00dfen riesiges Ei gelegt, dass ein Arsch von ausreichender Magnit\u00fcde und Spannkraft erst noch erfunden werden muss.  \nUnd mir soll hier keiner mit \"Ja, aber original Dresdner Worcesterso\u00dfe ist was ganz eigenes, das hat sich eben aus DDR-Zeiten so gehalten\" ankommen! DANN NENNT ES DOCH DRESDNER SO\u1e9eE, WENN IHR SO VERFICKT STOLZ DARAUF SEID, UND ZIEHT NICHT DEN GUTEN NAMEN VON LEA & PERRINS MIT EUREM SP\u00dcLWASSER IN DEN DRECK!  \nHier wird hersteller\u00fcbergreifend billigster Branntweinessig mit Zuckercouleur (dem ber\u00fchmten E150d aus der Cola) eingef\u00e4rbt, und lieblos ein paar Gew\u00fcrzextrakte sowie Unmengen Salz hinterhergeschmissen, weil muss ja nach was schmecken, nich? Zum Abschluss mal kr\u00e4ftig durchsch\u00fctteln, \u00e4hnlich wie beim hom\u00f6opathischen Potenzieren, und fertig ist der Lachs. ES IST ZUM HEULEN! DIESES ALS SCHMACKHAFTE W\u00dcRZSO\u1e9eE NACH ENGLISCHER ART VERPACKTE **SCHM\u00c4HGEDICHT AUF DIE ESSKULTUR** HAT NIE IM LEBEN AUCH NUR EIN WENIG TAMARINDE GESEHEN, GESCHWEIGE DENN EINE SARDELLE! Zugegeben, es gibt eine wunderbare, fischlose Sauce von Lacroix (die mit den Gem\u00fcsefonds), die man etwa bei Edeka oder Rewe zuweilen finden kann, und die trotzdem quasi perfekt schmeckt. Warum? WEIL SIE VERFICKT NOCHMAL TAMARINDE, DEN WICHTIGSTEN GESCHMACKSSTOFF, UND ECHTE GEW\u00dcRZE ENTH\u00c4LT, UND DAR\u00dcBER HINAUS FERMENTIERT WURDE! **FER-MEN-TA-TION!** UND NICHT BLO\u1e9e IM GRO\u1e9eEN KESSEL ZUSAMMENGEPANTSCHT, ABGEF\u00dcLLT UND AN DIE N\u00c4CHSTBESTEN D\u00d6SBADDEL VON EINZELH\u00c4NDLER F\u00dcR TEUER GELD VERKAUFT, UM ES DEM NICHTSAHNENDEN ENDVERBRAUCHER ALS DELIKATESSE ANZUDREHEN!  \nAber damit nicht genug. OH NEIN.  \nEs reicht ja nicht, dass hier unter falscher Flagge absoluter Schund hergestellt wird. NEEEEIIIIN. DIE DEUTSCHEN PISSBRAUER HABEN AUCH NOCH EIN SCHEI\u1e9e MONOPOL IN DEN SUPERMARKTREGALEN!  \nHabt ihr schon mal die original L&P-Sauce in einem deutschen Laden gesehen? Orangefarbenes, altmodisch anmutendes Etikett, irgendwie vintage? NOPE, nat\u00fcrlich nicht. H\u00f6chstens in Spezialit\u00e4tengesch\u00e4ften oder wirklich gro\u00dfen Superm\u00e4rkten. Die einzig guten Substitute, die man bekommt, sind mit gaaaaanz viel Gl\u00fcck die Sauce von Heinz oder Lacroix (letztere finde ich wie gesagt mega lecker, und ist f\u00fcr mich die einzige Alternative zur L&P, au\u00dferdem vegan). DIESE VERDAMMTEN WICHSER! UND EINE WEITERE SCHWEINEREI: APPEL ERDREISTET SICH ZU ALLEDEM AUCH NOCH, EIN \u00c4HNLICHES ETIKETT WIE L&P ZU VERWENDEN, MIT FAST IDENTISCHEM ORANGETON! SOLLEN DIESE CUXHAVENER SCHIETB\u00dcDEL GEF\u00c4LLIGST BEI IHRER EKELHAFTEN, RANZIGEN FISCHMAYO BLEIBEN! GENUG VON DER GAMMELTUNKE SCHEINEN SIE JA GEFRESSEN ZU HABEN, WENN SIE GLAUBEN, DASS ICH IHNEN IHR BRACKWASSER FREIWILLIG ABKAUFE!\n\nSo, ich bestelle jetzt 2 Flaschen L&P \u00e0 568 ml online, weil mein EDEKA mal wieder keine von Lacroix vorr\u00e4tig hat, und damit ich die n\u00e4chsten Monate versorgt bin. Sch\u00f6nen Tag noch."

I don't really know how the song continues though. The vocals are pretty high-pitched, multi-layered and have a typical 70's, almost Queen-like chorus effect added to them.

Once a dog gets into your salmon stash , that furry fucker will be coming back for more. With your people and dogs and cloth, that could be about dogs turning cloth into chew toys and people don\u2019t want that to happen.\n\nMoon time myths have certain reasonings that make perfect sense in the modern day, and others that probably should have stayed in the past. Such as shedding dead womb cell layers having the magical powers to give someone a \u201cbirth defect/divergence\u201d of their brain mechanics, by sharing something that they touched themselves. As if womb cells travelled up the girls digestive system, and managed to breed and spread all over this apparent poor cursed child.\n\nWith all the less than healthy medicine being spread around from their well meaning but poorly executed teachings, you have no cultural obligation to carry on any of the practices. Stay as far away from the spiritual side as you want, you can still attempt to keep more physical traditions alive. Can you hunt? Can you fish? Can you harvest plants? Can you craft? Cans you dance and sing or even speak your language? Those are all ways to keep a connection to the culture.\n\nYou do not need to become a spiritual leader of any sort, tho you might have to make some choices if you wish to step over the no pictures rule for different things.\n\nIs a tradition really worth it when no one is willing to gently explain things, and instead just expects you to be born with every single protocol branded into your head? And if they are not willing to explain things, does that mean that potentially the lesson was actually lost years ago, and they are just trying to hold together what little scraps and pieces they have left. That might be why they are so strict and harsh. \n\nMuch of the teachings could be gone, so any further deviation from what they know, spells death to the culture as it is now for future generations (therefor curses and shit)\n\nEdit: seen  the other comment about bad medicine not always being horrible.\n\nBad medicine can sometimes bring good outcomes to some extent, but the outcome is always going to be seen after some hindsight and time.\n\nEdit2: if those strawberries were home preserved, the only spirits that would have been offended and cursing you, would have been all the people attending the ceremony those strawberries were meant for. All the people that would have been emotionally triggered by a hungry child. ( hell, I can just imagine some people over here just casually commenting that your spirit just decided it was going to be the one to properly take the strawberries for the ceremony)",

I've been through this myself, so I know how hard it is to keep going when you feel like you're drowning. She's bright, intelligent and really empathetic, but told me that suicide feels like the only way out of this feeling of hopelessness and sadness. We have a decent family, nothing tragic happened lately so I really think that it's solely about her daily feelings and not about a separate event. I don't think that she have clinical depression, but she do feel incredibly tired and done with everything.\nWhen I was in her shoes, I met a new friend that, instead of taking pity on me and begging me to stay alive, debated with me for a whole year on \"reasons why I should live after 28\" (I was 15 at the time and I wanted to commit suicide at 28yo at the latest). But anyway, I don't think that would work with her.\nShe doesn't want the rest of our family to know (which I can understand since I felt the same at her age) and she's lost.\nI spent the whole evening telling her about how much I love her and how important she is to me and after we talked she eventually cried herself to sleep . For tomorrow, I convinced her to take a day off from school to focus on herself and I plan on making it a \"mental health day\" where I can stay by her side.\nI love her so much, I'm trying my absolute best to keep her going, but the very thought of her disappearing tetanizes me. I can't loose her. I just can't. She's too precious, I need her so much.\nAnyway, I really need advices on what to do next. After tomorrow, she'll still have to go to class and we'll have to resume our lives. I don't know what I can do to help her and convince her that what she feels isn't permanent and that, eventually, she'll feel better in the future.\nAny thought on this matter is greatly appreciated."

With the exception of Vitiate's Sith Empire (since we don't know what ulimately became of that one), every single Sith Empire to ever be built was destroyed by infighting or the betrayal/redemption of a Sith Lord. Ludo Kressh and Naga Sadow squandered the strength of the original Empire, allowing the Republic to steamroll what remained. Exar Kun's attempt at a Sith Empire fell through in large part because Ulic Qel-Droma deserted him. Malak was killed by Revan, and Darth Traya orchestrated the deaths of the entire Sith Triumvirate, herself included. The New Sith were all wiped out by Darth Bane. Not a good track record.",

                "body": "I'm sure nobody cares and that I've devoted way too much time to thinking about this, but whatever.\n\nSome background: in KOTOR 1, there\u2019s a mercenary on Manaan who calls himself an Iridorian, a species that had never appeared in Star Wars media before and has not appeared in person since. He\u2019s been a minor mystery for quite a long time now, since what exactly he\u2019s supposed to be was never really made clear. What\u2019s more, in later material that mentions these guys, Lucasfilm has insisted that the name be changed to Iridonian, claiming the original to be in error, which would imply that these guys are either from the same planet as or are supposed to be Iridonian Zabraks.\n\nThe thing is, the Iridorian in KOTOR 1 doesn\u2019t seem very Zabrak at all. His appearance is unknown, as he wears a full-body armored suit, but his and other mercenaries\u2019 description of his people suggests that they\u2019re an extremely bloodthirsty people who value bloodshed above all, known for desecrating the corpses of fallen foes and turning on each other when battle fever hits. While Iridonian Zabraks are established in lore to be warlike, this sort of ingrained societal bloodthirst is a bit beyond them.\n\nThe uniqueness of the Iridorian mercenary makes the whole thing even more compelling; he stands out and seems to have been intended to be significant. Still, we\u2019ve never gotten an official answer on the matter, and with KOTOR relegated to Legends, I doubt we ever will.\n\nHowever, after way too much time thinking about this, I'm almost certain that Iridorians were indeed meant to be Iridonian Zabraks.\n\nAll we have to go off in identifying the Iridorians is how they\u2019re characterized, since the mercenary\u2019s battle suit is actually just a swoop bike crash suit, as seen in the cutscene you get if you blow up on the Taris swoop track. His appearance is just another example of KOTOR reusing assets for minor characters. In all likelihood, the Iridorian was supposed to have a unique appearance but ended up with the swoop suit due to time constraints (reinforced by the Mandalorian and Echani mercs in the same module which also reused appearances, and by Queedle Molto appearing as an Ithorian despite being identified as Aqualish in dialogue, along with similar model inconsistencies on Manaan). \n\nSo all we have to go on is the Iridorians\u2019 bloodthirstiness, which isn\u2019t very helpful, and the Iridorian\u2019s position within the mercenary enclave, which is often overlooked in this discussion. The other mercs in this area, the Mandalorian and the Echani, are archetypes, representing much broader mercenary populations with major roles in the Jedi Civil Wae. Dialogue from the Mandalorian and the Iridorian imply that the three main mercs in the enclave represent the three biggest mercenary factions participating in the war, all fighting for their own reasons (honor, credits, bloodlust). Since the other two mercs are archetypes, it can be assumed the Iridorian is supposed to be as well.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because it establishes that Iridorians are supposed to be as galactically significant as the Mandalorians and the Echani, both of whom have decently significant presences in the worldbuild of the game. The Mandalorians obviously appear as a minor faction on several planets, and they also have lots of equipment the player can collect, and while there aren\u2019t any Echani beyond Manaan, there\u2019s plenty of Echani gear, some of which establishes Echani characters (like Yusanis and Sanasiki). \n\nThe Iridonians have no such representation - but the Zabraks do. Like with the Echani, the player can collect all sorts of Zabrak gear, and again, some of it establishes Zabrak characters (Jamoh Hogra and Jurgan Kalta). Beyond that, though, note how the tooltips of these items characterize the Zabrak. All of the different species-specific gear sets in KOTOR 1 emphasize some common factor that reflects their makers - Arkanian stuff is all way ahead of its time, Echani stuff is always well-crafted and good for maneuverability, Verpine stuff is always the product of questionable testing practices, etc. So what\u2019s the commonality of Zabrak gear? Sheer destructive power. \n\nZabrak weapons, especially Hogra/Kalta\u2019s stuff, deal more damage than any of their competitors in most cases, and their descriptions emphasize their power - and the ruthlessness of their owners. (\"The Zabrak killed many pirates who were attempting to seize shipments of these weapons and then sold them on the black market anyway. It's not a matter of where they end up, but of who gets paid.\") It presents a rough image of the Zabrak as these very violent mercenaries that don\u2019t take shit from anyone. This isn\u2019t terribly accurate to depictions of Zabrak in other sources - but it sure as hell sounds like the Iridorians, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a coincidence. \n\nAdditionally, if our Iridorian Merc really was meant to be an Iridonian Zabrak, that would explain his unique appearance - Zabraks have a distinct appearance, unlike the near-human Echani, so when they decided to reuse a model for him they had to go with one that was sufficiently ambiguous. \n\nAs I see it, the game\u2019s writers likely just had a misinformed picture of what the Zabraks as a species were like (perhaps based on Darth Maul), and the Iridorian mercenary was just a product of this."

                "body": "Hey guys, some of you have seen my post in October that I'm officially no longer inflamed and my colon is healing. Short update: right now, everything is awesome. Had the tiniest bit of blood after the holidays, but ate well and lots of greens after that and it went back to normal.\n\n\nSo, to the issue at hand:\nI always had problems with the colonoscopy prep - everytime I almost (sometimes not so almost) vomit and can't cleanse my colon good enough, because I can't drink enough of that devils nectar.\nSo I did stuff differently this time and let me tell you, it changed everything!\nSo for you people having to do your prep:\n\nNormally in Austria you do 3 litres of prep in the evening and again 3 litres at about 6 to 7 a.m.\nFirst of all I told my docs that I cannot drink 3 litres of prep and water in the morning (had to learn it the hard way) so we decided to move my appointment to the first possible the following day so I only had to drink prep from 4pm to the evening. The last prep has to be drank at about 8 to 9ish (depending, on how early you go to bed). The colonoscopy would be at about 7 a.m. Instead of 9 or 10.\n\n\nTo the drinking itself: I used the thickest straw I could find (the big black ones you get with cocktails) and tried to not let the prep touch my tongue. Also I drank as fast as possible, always 1/4 of a litre (one cup) and immediately apple juice after until the taste was gone. \n\n\nThat way I could drink the whole 6 litres prep in an evening and only drink water after that.\n\n\nWhy applejuice? Because cranberry or something else with enough taste to get the taste of the prep to fade would color your colon, which can lead to wrong diagnosis. I use the \"fresh\" applejuice (don't know what it's called in English, in German it's called naturtr\u00fcb) since it tends to have even less color.\n\n\nFor 6 litres of prep I use at least 1 1/2 litres of applejuice (when the taste is gone I only drink water)\nI always buy 3 litres since it's safe and last time I could donate one litre to a woman, who had her prep the day after and it was her first.\n\n\nDon't know if you guys are all experts at prepping but I would have loved to have a guide four years ago, when I vomited all out."

The clear skin lasted for about 2 months, but now my skin is cover in acne once again. I haven\u2019t really changed my routine, and I started school again which may be a factor, but my skin was originally fine at the start of the year. My guess would maybe be a product i am using, but that doubtful. Another idea may be stress, which i have had a lot of lately. My routine is still the same, just with some different products. I\u2019m planning on booking an appointment with a dermatologist to see if they have an idea what i can do to clear my skin again.

Additionally, a quick search on google revealed to me that guidelines were created in order to encourage limitations on suicide news reporting. However, according to a 2018 study, newspapers tend to follow loosely or barely such guidelines ([link here](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-6014-4)).\n\nScientific evidence supports the idea that news coverage of suicides can lead to more people taking their lives.\n\nIn this way, I question if the news coverage of suicides is that common in Korea? And is it usual to report on common people suicides frequently, as well? On the contrary, do you think these type of stories are in fact not covered that much in SK?\n\nThank you so much for your attention\n\n\nFeel free to drop in the comments suicide prevention hotlines in Sk and other parts of the world."

It is super heart warming and wholesome, since the two share a great connection and friendship, a wholesome bromance if you will. I just watched and it made me feel much better after a rough end of day. Let me know what you think about it!\nPeace!"

I am always scared that I'd overwhelm my loved ones, since it's already bad enough as it is.\n\nBut here it goes:\n\nI don't really recall how old I was. But it has to have been between the ages of 3 and 5, because I took swimming classes, just before I entered primary school (age 5-6).\n\nIt was a sunny day and I was lying on top of one of those plastic crocodiles. The memory is still so clear in my mind, as if it happened yesterday. Everything. From the sensation of the sun on my back, that caused me to change positions. To the cold of the water. The surprise. That quickly melted into utter panic, as I realized that I wasn't able to get out by myself. I wasn't wearing any water wings, because the adults supposedly thought that the crocodile would be enough protection. Or maybe I insisted that it would be fine. That's one detail I don't remember. Either way, it wasn't. The pool had an artificial current and it caused the crocodile, which I used to try and pull myself out of the water, to consistently float above my head. I couldn't breathe. Ever time I looked up, all I could see was the water surface, the crocodile on top and the sun shining through it. I was losing air. I was panicking. I could feel myself dying. My attempts got weaker and weaker. I didn't want to give up. But the burning sensation in my lungs was getting worse. In my mind I was screaming for help. For my Mum. For my Dad. Both of which, weren't even present, since I was at my friend's place and her Dad was somewhere in the back of the garden. I remembered that too. I thought I was lost. No one was going to help me. I was going to die. I don't know how I knew. I feel like it's an instinct we are all born with. Even without people telling us. No matter how old we are. We just know we have to get ourselves out of danger. But I couldn't. I was weak. I was helpless. I was alone. I was utterly mortified. My vision was blurring until it eventually gave out.\n\nSuddenly light. I had to blink a couple of times, before I could make out the shapes in front of me. I could see the face of my friend's Dad. And her. Both looking down at me in worry. I coughed up some water and then managed to sit up. Still weak. But alive. I don't know how long I was out for. I don't remember if I had to be revived, or if I came to, after he pulled me out. I don't know how much time passed, before my friend reached her Dad and told him about it. I can only assume what happened, since I never told my parents. I don't know if her Dad did. Either way, no one ever brought it up again. And I was too scared too, because I didn't want my parents to forbid me from visiting my best friend again. So I kept my mouth shut. I suffered in silence. For so many years. Again, I have since told some people. But never like this. The overwhelming dread that came with it. The feeling of hopelessness. It's still there. At the back of my head. Every time I get a particularly bad cold and feel like I can't breath. It brings me back to that time. It makes me feel like I am dying all over again. It's hard to talk about it. I don't wanna upset anyone. I don't want them to know just how badly this has been affecting me. But today I just felt like I had to put it out there. Even if no one will read it. I feel like just writing it out and posting it with the chance of someone reading through it all, will provide me with some form of relief."

Growing up, she always made me walk on eggshells, was emotionally abusive and favored my brother.\n\nMy mental health suffered severely under her mistreatment, which lead to me eventually going very low contact with her.\n\nHowever I never found it in my heart to tell her the reason. I simply was too scared that she wouldn't listen or try to blame me for her mistakes. It didn't help, that she would make passive-aggressive remarks over me distancing myself from her. She never really asked me why. \n\nRecently I have made some improvements and it inspired me to talk to her again. I wanted closure for myself and potentially repair our relationship \n\nI didn't want to demonize her. I realized that I wronged some people due to my own mental issues (pretty sure I have OCD.I have a history of being controlling, when my intrusive thoughts would overwhelm me and I saw it as the only way to protect my loved ones. However I always felt bad about it and I wanna change. I also apologized to a lot of people since.) and as such, felt like I could find it in my heart to forgive her. After all she too was a human, who made mistakes. I just wanted her to own up to hers and potentially apologize/change for the better. \n\nI introduced this conversation as an exchange of ideas. At first that seemed to work for us. However over time, I noticed that the wounds were too deep. That I needed her to listen to everything first. But I didn't know where to start. She made me feel like I had to justify myself to her. Like I wasn't actually opening up, but rather explaining it to her, in hopes of her \"accepting\" my feelings. I couldn't completely trust her with them. \n\nI told her as much and she blamed me for going back on the initial proposal. Also how I too had to accept responsibility (tbf, she mostly talked about my behavior towards her as an adult). How I asked her to be understanding/respectful, but I wasn't providing the same service to her.\n\nI feel like she might be right and I could have made a better effort at it. But I also feel like I am providing a service, since it should not be my responsibility to initiate this heart-to-heart in the first place. I also find it hard to be respectful towards her rn, while we haven't been able to work through our past issues (most of which started in my early childhood). I told her, that I needed for her to make an effort to make me feel like I didn't have to justify myself to her, before I could talk to her again. But maybe I should have made a better effort at trusting her again. For now. Since I don't actually want to lose her either. So was I too harsh? Or did she need the wake-up call?"

You cannot re-entangle the same pair of particles while being far apart. \n\nSo basically, entanglement only happens in pairs, locally, and then can be distanced without breaking entanglement. And then once you observe it for the first time, it breaks down. Now it's useless. Also, the outcomes are random hence even the first interaction cannot be used. \n\nI'm thinking can we make some use of entanglement by prior decision making? Like suppose two people make a pact that a certain outcome would mean they do one thing, else the other. \nLike suppose they decide who will kill themselves based upon the result. Is this possible?\n\n Like suppose, for example, they decide life and death on the outcome of a spin measurement. Spin up means die and spin down means live. If A's particle is up then they die and hence B lives and vice versa.\n\nI think not, because it is still FTL communication, and apparently shouldn't be possible.\n\nMaybe this can be remedied by the fact that there is not just one set of directions like up and down, just that they will be opposites. i.e. you can't determine what is up and what is down beforehand. So this will cause misunderstanding and communication will fail. Like it might cause both of them to die, if both think that what they've measured is up, or down.",

                "body": "For the past month, I've listened to Will Toledo's work, including Nervous Young Men. Here is my ranking from WORST TO BEST. (Prepare for the occasional Scott the Woz reference)\n\n21.) 2: 4/10\n\nIt's really not that good. A lot of Will's most uninteresting or just plain annoying work. This blows!\n\n20.) 1: 6/10\n\nIt's definitely better than 2 but, again, I just find this record quite unengaging other than Kid War. Just didn't do much for me.\n\n19.) Making a Door Less Open: 6/10\n\nThis is the most 6/10 record to ever 6/10 it's so all over the place. This simultaneously has some of their BEST work (Martin, Deadlines (Thoughtful), Life Worth Missing to some extent) and some real \"hahahaha, wait Toledo, you're actually releasing this?\" tracks (Hymn (Remix), Famous). But, in the end, a lot of the songs just kind of end up...existing for me. Even in-your-face tracks like Hollywood are just kind of...there.\n\n18.) The Loudness War: 7/10\n\nAgain, not to much to say. It definitely reeks of \"I failed my driver's test and now I'm sad.\" Though, this album does have some interesting experiments on it. \n\n17.) Boxing Day: 7/10\n\nBasically the same thoughts as The Loudness War. \n\n16.) Teens of Style: 7/10\n\nThis is a compilation of tracks largely from MBIKMB and Monomania with the occasional track from 3. The renditions here are fine but just worse when compared to their predecessors (The Drum is so mediocre here when it's so great on the OG). They're not horrendously bad or anything. They're actually pretty good but they're just kind of a letdown when compared to the original versions.\n\n15.) The Bell Jar: 7/10\n\nThis one's just fun as hell. Not something I go back to often but it is enjoyable when I do.\n\n14.) Little Pieces of Paper With No Written On Them: 7/10\n\nLook, it's not that bad, guys. It's really fun and weird as shit and super all over the place but, god is it fun as hell. I CAN'T TALK WITH MY EYES SHUT is also one of Will's best tracks and should've been on MBIKMB. YOU COULD'VE PUT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE TRACKLIST, WILL, IT'S NOT THAT HARD! \n\n13.) Monomania: 7/10\n\nThis will be my most controversial ranking. I'm sorry that I don't love this album. It's good. It's very, very good. I just don't love it. Los Barrachos and Souls (YEAH I SAID IT) really aren't that great. The first four tracks are great, though very spiteful, indie rock tracks with a danceable twist. Anchorite is...it's a song. Okay...this album is the antithesis of Twin Fantasy. Whatever good will sent towards Cate in TF is fucking destroyed here. It's hateful and slimy. There are even a couple parts of this album that could be construed as transphobic, what with a section of Anchorite literally being called DEATH OF A LADY-MAN. WILL. STOP IT. RIGHT NOW. Mind you, Anchorite is a beautiful track but it's just...hard to listen to. You know it is based on the fact that I put more ellipses here than James Joyce writing Penelope in Ulysses. This album is good but I can't go back to it often.\n\n12.) Starving While Living: 8/10\n\nThis is more or less an epilogue to Monomania as far as I'm aware. It takes the self-loathing note it left off on and fucking RUNS WITH IT. From the stilted It's Only Sex to psychedelic newer rendition of Oh! Starving. It's also pretty hard to listen to at times but it's got more interesting instrumental experimentation here than it's predecessor so it nudges it up.\n\n11.) Nervous Young MEN: 8/10\n\nTHIS IS FOR THE SELF-TITLED PROJECT OF WILL'S YESTERYEARS. This album's fun. It's personal and weird. It has Bignose on it. \n...\n\n10.) Katzenjammer: 8/10\n\nThis album is so fucking fun. It's quirky and awesome and awkward. I just have a lot of fun. I listened to this while deflating an air mattress and that's the most fun I've ever had deflating an air mattress. It also has Chlorine on it which is...*chef's kiss*\n\n9.) Nervous Young Man: 8/10\n\nOh boy, the 130 minute lo-fi extravaganza of Nervous Young Man. It features a few tracks from Will's older project, hence the name. It's just a really nice lo-fi rock album, simple as that. Goes on for too long though. It's also a little folksy for my taste. The last half of the record also kind of falters, in my opinion (possibly due to listener fatigue). Despite this, it has some of Will's best tracks. From the 15+ minute ballads of Boxing Day and The Gun Song to the indietronic sadness of Afterglow and I Wanna Sweat to the rip-roaring rock tunes of Jerks (which I will forever defend) and We Can't Afford (Your Depression Anymore) to just pure depression in Don't Remind Me and Big Jacket, this album has it ALL.\n\n8.) 4: 9/10\n\nThis album grew on me a lot. It's got some real beauty to it like on Dickless Heart and Around and more darkly funny sadness on The Ghost of Bob Saget and Not \"Kidding\" Around. It's just some nice psych, man.\n\n7.) 3: 9/10\n\nThis album is the epitome of going to the beach, diving into the frigid waters, and letting all your worries wash away. They're still there, mind you. Just a little farther back. There are numerous parts of this album that are straight up euphoric. Namely Foreign Song and Beach Funeral. Those songs legit make me feel all of my emotions in perfect fucking harmony. Just some GREAT psych, man.\n\n6.) Teens of Denial: 9/10\n\nJust some fun rock tunes about being sad and doing drugs my girls, bros, and non-binary hoes. \n\n5.) Twin Fantasy (Mirror-to-Mirror): 9/10\n\nThis is definitely an album. It's got a beautiful range from prog-rock of biblical proportions to They Might Be Giants and galvanism. A modern way of the rock opera. However, it is hampered by the production. It couldn't quite match it's ambitions. I sure do hope Will might rerecord it one day...\n\n4.) My Back is Killing Me Baby: 10/10\n\nOh boy, this album is something. This has some of Will's most interesting songwriting, catchiest hooks, and cool-as-fuck instrumentation. This is truly where he came into his own. I CAN TALK WITH MY EYES SHUT should've been on here though.\n\n3.) Disjecta Membra: 10/10\n\nThis might be interesting to see for some of you. This album is the B-Sides for Nervous Young Man. You can only really find rips of it from YouTube. But, it's simply leagues better than NYM. It's so much more sonically interesting with weird ass experiments and some of Will's more heartbreaking lyrics (see Sinner, which I'm listening to as I type this). It also has Pain Star. We'll get to Pain Star.\n\n2.) How to Leave Town: 10/10\n\nThis is not an EP, Will. This is a masterpiece. The ambitious song structures, the beautiful and strange instrumentation, the phantasmal (and all too relatable for me) lyrics. It's all here. In truth, if any other band had released this, if our timeline had altered slightly, this would be Number 1. But this is Car Seat Headrest. And this is our timeline.\n\n1.) Twin Fantasy (Face-to-face): 10/10\n\nThis is one of my favorite albums of all time. Almost every track is perfect (Nervous Young Inhumans is phenomenal but I find that the spoken word drags a teensy bit). We've got melodrama on My Boy, progressive rock with punk energy on Beach Life-in-Death, folk about substance abuse on Stop Smoking, heartbreaking indie rock beauty on Sober to Death, danceable monologues on Nervous Young Inhumans, heartbreaking dance-rock on Bodys, rip-roaring indie on Cute Thing, pure unadulterated sadness and substance abuse in the form of the psychedelic High to Death, progressive indie rock of biblical proportions on Famous Prophets and it's inclusion of the beautiful glitchy Pain Star, and accepting balladry on Those Boys. All of it's beauty, now with a budget. Has anyone else noticed the symmetry of the album? Just another aspect of it's genius. But, all of this, is carried by Will's excellent, heartbreaking, now matured songwriting. It's practically perfect. Though, it's such a virgin album. How am I going to get a boyfriend now?! Might as well cancel it out, right? Let's see...where can I find Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast?\n\nThank you for sticking with me for this. What did you think? Agree? Disagree? I'm eager to hear your opinions and even your own personal ranking!"

You can also post your own personal rankings in the comments. I'd be interested to see what others think. Now, let's get started.\n\nWorst: Hear the Wind Sing\n\nNot horrible, just really boring. It was also his debut so you gotta give him some slack. 5/10.\n\n13th: Norwegian Wood\n\nThis lacks a lot of what I enjoy in Murakami. I understand that this was many people's gateway to Murakami but it just doesn't do much for me. Just a, for the most part, typical romance. 6/10.\n\n12th: Hard-boiled Wonderland and the End of the World\n\nI am going to get a lot of flack for this one. This is definitely one of Murakami's more highly-regarded works. I just got nothing out of this. The \"Hard-boiled Wonderland\" side was decent but seemed like a relatively typical cyberpunk story. I really didn't like the \"End of the World\" segments. It was so strange that I found myself dumbfounded (mind you, my 2 favorite films of all time are END OF EVANGELION AND INLAND EMPIRE). Not my  thing. 6/10.\n\n11th: Pinball, 1973\n\nI felt as though this was when Murakami started developing his signature surreal style. This is a funny little surreal romp. Like a lot of his shorter novels (Hear the Wind Sing, Pinball, After Dark, Sputnik Sweetheart, Colorless Tsukuru, South of the Border) I finished it in one sitting. Enjoyable if rough. 7/10.\n\n10th: South of the Border, West of the Sun\n\nThis is what I expected Norwegian Wood to be. I felt more attached to the characters. I felt like it was a better constructed novel than Norwegian Wood. 7/10.\n\n9th: Sputnik Sweetheart\n\nThis and South of the Border are relatively interchangeable in place for me. The romance that occurs here is more interesting and, though a tad confusing, I thought the time travel aspect added a bit of spice to what would just be a typical romance novel. Bonus points for decent LGBTQ representation. 7/10.\n\n8th: Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage\n\nA real nice mix of mystery and bildungsroman, this novel was quite the read. It might not have much of Murakami's trademark surrealism but it makes up for that with an interesting air of mystery and good characters.\n\n7th: Killing Commendatore\n\nA really good novel but it's just Wind-up Bird with less of its amazing aspects. It does have interesting commentary on the creative process which is helpful for me as an aspiring author. 8/10.\n\n6th: Dance Dance Dance\n\nNow we're getting into the real good stuff. This is a funny, breathtaking, and beautifully surreal novel. A real fun novel to read. You can tell how much fun Murakami had while writing this. He literally put himself in the novel! 10/10.\n\n5th: A Wild Sheep Chase\n\nThis is where Murakami hit his stride. It has basically all of his trademarks: mystery, surrealism, horror, dry witty comedy, a character that's basically Murakami himself, and much more. 10/10.\n\n4th: 1Q84\n\nI feel like Murakami has gotten hornier as he's gotten older. Despite that, this is still an utterly breathtaking novel with a lot of amazing stuff. Pacing is a bit all over the place though. Strange, terrifying, funny, honestly borders on uncanny, and really beautiful. 10/10.\n\n3rd: The Wind-up Bird Chronicle\n\nHoly shit. 10/10.\n\n2nd: After Dark\n\nThis is a HIDDEN GEM. I don't see anyone take about this! I finished this in the span of 4 hours on a late winter night and was utterly gobsmacked at the beauty of this novel. Never has a single night in the city been so perfectly portrayed. The characters are amazing. It has a really nice mix of realism and surrealism. Not everything is explained but it doesn't need to be in order to just \"get\" it. 10/10. 3rd favorite novel of all time.\n\n1st: Kafka on the Shore\n\nThis was my first Murakami. It has a very special place in my heart. It has a lot of Murakami's trademark aspects but it's also very different from his typical fare. This book feels like waking up and feeling the body heat of your lover next to you in bed. This book is indescribably beautiful. 10/10. 2nd favorite novel of all time.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you agree or disagree? What is your personal ranking?"

Because it is.\n\nIt being a free experience does not mean it makes sense to get rid of Red War. They didn't have to do any extra work to just leave it alone. It actually took infinitely more work to get rid of it and add a new one, even if very short and not remotely engaging, in its place. Removing something that was already in place because the game is free now and you want to lock everything fun behind a paywall makes zero sense.\n\nI did not make a blood pact with you where I swore on my mother's grave and promised to never touch the game again. I said I would probably not play again, because if removing paid content is a theme with the game now, that doesn't really make me want to invest time into it. Which is true.\n\nAnd yes, I absolutely still stand by that what I experienced was dogshit. That campaign was fucking terrible. It can't even really be called a campaign. It wasn't even voice acted. I'm not changing my argument at all, because that fact is a byproduct of the DCV being fucking stupid. Every argument I have made either relates to the DCV being dumb, or the current base experience of the game without expansions being really unengaging with absolutely nothing in place to make someone want to keep playing. Both of these things are true.\n\nMe personally, I don't play video games because I like improved loot systems. Y1 D2's content alone makes it leagues better in my mind than the absolute void of no content for new players that exists now. There was an entire real and long campaign in the old base game, not in the new one. That is all that has to be said. You can list out all of the QoL improvements and achievements you would like, the base game is still worse now due to the removal of several locations and the actual story of the video game.\n\nAlso Jesus Christ man, you meticulously breaking down every word I say and quoting every line of every comment I make while responding with bullet-pointed lists is the most nerd emoji Reddit atheist shit I have ever seen someone do in my entire life.",

Uninstalled sometime shortly after, but recently decided to download it on Steam and start fresh to see what's changed and if I can get back into it.\n\nPretty early on I realized the start of the game was different. I remembered finding a ship and going to the old D1 tower, then the Cabal attack and you spend some time at the Farm on Earth for a while.   \n\n\nAfter looking it up I saw that they had vaulted the old content, and while I found that disappointing, I was eager to find out what new campaign there was instead. After all, I had already experienced the Red War back in the day, so I wasn't really missing anything, even if I wanted to start from the beginning again.   \n\n\nWell fast forward a few hours, I now can't find another quest to do. From the looks of it, all there is to do at this point is multiplayer stuff, or endlessly wander around in like 2 different locations accomplishing nothing.\n\nAm I missing where the next quest is in the campaign, or did they literally just completely gut it of content so there is nothing to do anymore? I'm actually confused. If their reason for vaulting the old content was to make room for new content so the game wasn't 400 GB, \\*where is the new content?\\*  \n\n\nThere used to at least be something to \\*do\\* when you were done with the main questline. You could explore Io, Nessus, Titan, Mars, Mercury, etc. There were side quests littering every corner of the game.  \n\n\nDid they really just... get rid of all of it? I can't even see why people would still be playing this game in that case. They just took it all out? Seriously? I remember playing for HUNDREDS of hours before Curse of Osiris even dropped, there was \\*so\\* much shit to do in the base game. Is it genuinely gone? If it is, I can't believe I'm actually saying this for the first time in my life but... I miss Activision. At least there was a video game to be played while they were working on it. Does Bungie just not see the importance in core content? Are weekly bounties the only reason to play the video game now?  \n\n\nGrinding for gear, doing patrols, doing raids, these things were there to add life into the game and give you things to do after beating the actual game. Continuously improving your character is fun, sure... but it's not everything. Like... why would I play now, exactly? I could just go play a different looter-shooter or loot-based ARPG that still has an actual game at its core instead. Diablo 3 or Borderlands are looking like significantly more attractive options right now.\n\nI could just be missing something, and there is actually a reason to play the game, but I can't seem to find the next quest I'm supposed to be doing. I did like three lame-ass fetch quests and a Vanguard strike, and now... nothing? This game used to have an incredibly awesome campaign that kept you playing, where you visited a ton of different planets and discovered the Vex, Cabal, Taken, etc. and those moments were really cool. It felt like you were constantly finding new stuff, new gear, new abilities. \n\nNow you just... purchase all your abilities at the tower? You don't get to help make humanity's new base on the new tower, and help humanity get back on its feet? They got rid of that really cool segment where you would get close to the traveler and attune to the Light to get your other subclasses? The part where you dive into the Hive's nests on Titan? You don't grow attached to the speaker anymore, see him die, take revenge? What the hell?  \n\n\nI'm really just confused. It seems like they took a good game, and removed absolutely everything good from it. Like... am I supposed to want to keep playing now? Because I don't. There's nothing to actually do, from the looks of it."

Since stumbling across this subreddit a few weeks ago, I've gathered lots of valuable info that has been a complete game changer. I started taking some of the recommended supplements (Berberine, myo-inositol, turmeric, fish oil, vitamin D, zinc, iron, etc.), eating a low-glycemic, anti-inflammatory diet, trying harder to exercise (yoga, weight training, long walks), and here is what I've noticed.\n\n1. Taking supplements to boost my insulin sensitivity has also helped with my metabolism and sugar cravings. I think that eating healthier overall and loosely following CICO has helped also, but I've lost about 6 lbs in three weeks without killing myself with exercise or an extremely restrictive diet. And I'm still eating a decent amount of CARBS! (Healthy, low glycemic carbs like wheat bread and brown rice, but still.) However, I rarely have those crazy sugar/chocolate cravings at night that I'd have prior to starting my supplements.\n2. My skin and hair is noticeably less greasy. I had a feeling that it was related to my changes and asked a help website, HealthyPCOS (@HealthyPCOS on Insta), and they let me know that excess testosterone and androgen production can increase sebum in your face and hair. I thought my oily scalp was a hereditary thing, but it's starting to look like it could have also been PCOS related. I can now go about three days without washing my hair where as before, I'd basically have to wash every day. :(\n3. I actually have energy to workout now. Before, I'd be exhausted at the end of the day and the thought of doing exercise seemed impossible. I'm still working towards being consistent with my routine, but now it doesn't seem so daunting and I feel more motivated to work out.\n4. My period came back after not having it for several months! **This is huge**. As I get closer to 30, and starting to think about a baby in the future, worries about infertility have been really bothering me. My periods have been irregular since my mid 20s, so I'm hoping that by continuing this routine I can establish a more consistent menstrual cycle.\n\nSo, small victories as they are, reflecting back on it has made me really happy and optimistic for the future. What are some wins that you've had with treating your PCOS?"

Sure it does much less damage, but you also have free advantage for the entire adventuring day *and* keep your Concentration slot free for other things (Hold Monster and Banishing Smite do come to mind).\n\nOn the other hand, gaining advantage on your attacks at 17+ level is not that difficult, and Blade of Disaster + Elven Accuracy sounds like disgusting amounts of extra DPR.\n\nI understand that Foresight and Crown of Stars are both meant to be used over several fights or probably even the entire adventuring day for the former, whereas Shadow of Moil and Blade of Disaster both fall into the \"fuck this one encounter in particular\" category, but since Warlocks only get a single lvl 9 cast, you have to pick one or the other for every case.\n\nSo on one hand I'm thinking that Foresight is a way more consistent and flexible choice for your one 9th level cast per day. It's reliable, good across the board and lasts basically for the entire day. On the other hand, though, I'm also thinking that having advantage for 8 hours straight is not absolutely necessary. Shadow of Moil already does a pretty fine job of granting free advantage for an entire encounter, when it's needed, so the 9th level cast could perhaps make a more important difference used on a huge, temporary boost in DPR.\n\nBut I really can't decide whether it's better (and more fun!) to just have a mild god-mode for 8 hours or be able to break the DPR charts for 1 minute.

Some things catch on fire and there's the occasional scorch mark, but the power of Firebending is mostly conveyed via collateral damage and dialogue. We never really see it doing anything in combat because it's always dodged or blocked, UNLESS it's an accident, to show us how much it should be feared.\n\nBut really, why should it?\n\nFirebending in the show was never allowed the sheer displays of power that are possible with the other three forms- comet-powered Firebending by maybe the most powerful Firebender in the world is MAYBE on par with casual bending from masters of the other elements.\n\nFriends were telling me that, if these limitations to Fire had not been in place, in a hypothetical, more gritty-realistic scenario, Firebending could be brutal. Even in the show it can slice through solid rock and evaporate bodies of water... at least when plot armor for Team Avatar doesn't suddenly kick in. So in reality it *should* be able to bulldoze everything else.\n\nHowever, if you also lift the PG-13 limitations for the other elements as well, they... actually kinda outclass it again, in terms of damage. Earthbending can pretty much instantly bury, crush or impale someone and its attacks in the show seem nearly impossible to dodge unless you can fly, and it also has the best defense hands down. Air can also instakill via asphyxiation and has insane AoE- an IRL full-throttle air blast could create shockwaves able to kill, daze and deafen an entire neighborhood. Waterbending can kinda do everything since it can kinda simulate every other element, including blasts, shields, throwing huge solid chunks or even the simple ice daggers they throw around in the show (always strictly for intimidation), which in reality would be lethal.\n\nSo I'm a little skeptical about Firebending's proclaimed lethal supremacy when the other three elements (particularly Earth, but honestly also Water) can literally brute-force slap you into the ground with raw damage *just as easily* while also being the more defensive, utilitarian elements.\n\nLavabending has a similar threat level to Fire and Earth's utility, and it quickly became one of the most terrifyingly destructive bendings in the show once it started appearing on-screen more actively, simply because it was allowed to do actual damage. Guess it's harder to handwave away the risk of falling into magma than getting sprayed with fire.\n\nStill, I'm kinda impressed at how the element we have come to associate with raw destruction is so pitifully ineffective at it."

They're getting quite strong, and they've 4 casters of different classes in the party, so they have *plenty* of powerful tools to work with. And I'm honestly reaching that point where I'm wondering if it's about time I stopped giving them a more or less obvious way out.\n\nIf the current arc of the story goes as expected, they'll end up stranded in an underground system of caves, inhabited by an Illithid colony. And I'm kinda scared of what this means for them - Illithid are notoriously intelligent and you can't ever surprise them. They'll know the players are coming, and they'll do their very best to neutralize them in the most wicked and efficient ways possible. They'll try to catch them off-guard, attack them in waves, overwhelm them, stun them, confuse them, mind control them, turn them against each other, employ disgusting tactics including Mindwitnesses and Intellect Devourers.\n\nFor the first time in this campaign (and our history as D&D players, myself included), the enemies are both smart enough *and* evil enough to relentlessly go after the weakest link. Unfortunately, the only frontline fighter of the party has dumped Intelligence, Wisdom AND Charisma in favor of physical attributes. He's dumb as a rock. So if I play the Illithid as they *should* be played, he's basically all but doomed (unless the others find some way that I can't think of to prevent this).\n\nOn top of all that, there's just no way to recover from the Illithid methods of killing at level 8- Revivify does nothing if your brain was removed. Even a single successful Feeblemind against them would frustrate them to no end (\"what do you mean I'm gonna be like this AT LEAST for 30 days!?!?!!?!?\"), let alone any \"unfair\" casualties (\"unfair\" being anything that doesn't just slap them with raw damage until either it dies or they do).\n\nObviously I won't overinflate CRs beyond what's appropriate or anything like that. I WANT them to survive and win, after all. But I also don't want to keep tailoring each encounter to their strengths forever, they're adventurers well into Tier 2. If I am to be truly impartial and fair to my NPCs without dumbing them down, I'm obliged to actively seek to destroy them, starting with the painfully obvious dense motherfucker.\n\nShould I just go for it and let them know true pain, or declaw the threat a bit and avoid frustration? Ultimately I want them to have fun, and losing is never fun. Especially a couple of them will probably be quite upset at the things I plan to do to them. On the other hand, it's not right for me to hold their hand till they're level 20, and never let them face anything that can truly horrify them and hit them where it hurts most. How would you approach this?\n\nApologies for the long post, appreciate any and all input :)"

I'm SUPER hyped, but even though I've RP'd tons of characters as a DM, it's been so long since I had my own PC and I'm anxious to get him right. :D\n\nI will be playing a Hexblade Warlock who's romantically involved with his patron, a demon lord of the Abyss. The character's alignment is neutral-neutral evilish (party is entirely Neutral, save for one Good and one Evil player, so it's not a problem). Despite his grey morality, his personality is very naturally amicable and bright, and overall he's very pleasant to be around. He's sociable and cooperative as long as his personal agenda isn't jeopardized, so pretty much the opposite from the \"dark, brooding rogue\" trope that will mysteriously sulk in the corner, waiting for someone to pester him enough for him to begrudgingly reveal his tragic backstory.\n\nHowever, despite the guy being possibly the most well-adjusted of the bunch, he still *completely* lacks a moral compass, and I want his main schtick to be this contrast between his temperate personality and his absence of any sort of conscience. I want him to cross the line between horror and relatability, twice. I want him to make his Neutral acquaintances willfully ignore the warning signs about him because he's just such a magnificent bastard, until he proves that he's actually *truly* fucked up in spite of his manners- but his jovial personality actually isn't an act, so he retains his relatable factor.\n\nWhat I want to avoid is creating an \"[obliviously evil](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil)\" character who doesn't *understand* he's causing harm. He's not insane nor ignorant, he's actually very pragmatic about what he does. On the other hand, I don't want him to end up with an obnoxious, Harley Quinn-like [psychopathically cheerful](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherSmile) attitude a la \"tee hee killing is kool xddd\". For Jojo fans, I imagine him a bit like a more sociable Kira Yoshikage- a polite, good-humored person who'd be a poster child for a productive member of society if it wasn't for his occasional tendency to murder people with his demonic arsenal as a tribute to his lover patron.\n\nBasically he's a variant of the [Token Evil Teammate](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate), where he's not destructive enough for the party to be *seriously* pissed at him (they're neutrals after all), but he's also not innocent enough for the party to think him as more or less incapable of truly being a threat.\n\nI want him to be a fun and mostly productive, but also a bit scary, (temporary) addition to the party. How should I go about playing him so that he doesn't stumble too close to the unwanted tropes of \"unironically edgy\", \"adorably ineffectual villain\" and \"irredeemably evil\"?"

Sure, the target takes 4d10 damage every turn if it keeps failing saves, but for a 4th level slot I can literally just pick Blight and do 8d8 instantly for a single save, or, hell, upcast Hold Person to 4th level and *PARALYZE* 3 enemies with just a single save, allowing my entire team to whoop their asses.\n\nPK seems like such a cool spell thematically, I really want to pick it on this Warlock I'm making, but no matter how much I stretch its thematic coolness I just cannot justify spending a 4th level slot on a save-every-turn Concentration spell that gives TWO initial saves to the target to do just 4d10 damage, and then they get to save again on their next round or it ends completely.\n\nEven fucking Hunger of Hadar, a 3rd level spell that doesn't scale with upcasting, does 4d6 (or 2d6 if they passed the save) to all creatures in the AoE *every turn*, *doesn't* end on a success (so a creature making a save doesn't mean it's safe) AND the area is difficult terrain, completely dark, cannot be lit by *any* means, and creatures inside it are blinded. In other words, it's a *much* more competent option for my Concentration, and it's one slot level lower.\n\nWhat is even the point of picking Phantasmal Killer, if I'm not allowed to homebrew buff it?"

Can *Major Image* (or *Silent Image*, tho obviously to a lesser extent) be used to create an entire scene? I know it says \"**a** creature, object or other phenomenon\" but what exactly does that *mean*? Is it literally ONE creature or object? Can I use it to create a room with furniture inside it, for example? Can I create a captain with a parrot on her shoulder? What about a swarm of mice? Then what about a band of soldiers? Where do you draw the line, and why?\n2. Can *Silent* or *Major Image* be used to create the illusion of depth where there is none? For example, can I create an opening on a flat wall that, when others look at it, gives the illusion of a huge throne room behind it? Obviously there's no illusion of an actual full size throne room going on (I specifically used an example of something way too big to imitate with such spells), but I'm also talking about something a bit better than a forced perspective photorealistic illusory image with no parallax.\n3. Furthermore, can Illusion spells \"overwrite\" solid matter? For example, can I use *Minor Illusion* to create a pothole in the ground, or will the surface of the ground poke through the hologram, hiding the illusion of the hole entirely as it sits buried below the surface? Of course, I'm aware that this is a slippery slope to the age-old question \"can I use Major Illusion to give my entire party invisibility by imitating empty space\", but subtractive illusions *should* be a thing, right?

I saw that it has the major 7 leading tone so it would make it harmonic minor, but it seems to feel a bit weirder than a regular minor song. I don\u2019t see any other chromatic alterations that are frequent so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s another mode. It seems to use a restricted set of notes though. Any thoughts?"

As we say in California, I'll bet you couldn't pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won't go away. A zit on the butt of society. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.\n\nYou are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you. You are a bloody nardless newbie twit protohominid chromosomally aberrant caricature of a coprophagic cloacal parasitic pond scum and I wish you would go away.\n\nYou're a putrescence mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.\n\nYou are a bleating fool, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.\n\nI will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. Because off your face the rabbit population actually decreased. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?\n\nIf you aren't an idiot, you made a world-class effort at simulating one.\n\nYou snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.\n\nYou are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.\n\nYou are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meatslapper.\n\nOn a good day you're a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.\n\nI cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.\n\nMaybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us \"normal\" people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are \"challenged\" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.\n\nP.S.: You are hypocritical, greedy, violent, malevolent, vengeful, cowardly, deadly, mendacious, meretricious, loathsome, despicable, belligerent, opportunistic, barratrous, contemptible, criminal, fascistic, bigoted, racist, sexist, avaricious, tasteless, idiotic, brain-damaged, imbecilic, insane, arrogant, deceitful, demented, lame, self-righteous, byzantine, conspiratorial, satanic, fraudulent, libelous, bilious, splenetic, spastic, ignorant, clueless, illegitimate, harmful, destructive, dumb, evasive, double-talking, devious, revisionist, narrow, manipulative, paternalistic, fundamentalist, dogmatic, idolatrous, unethical, cultic, diseased, suppressive, controlling, restrictive, malignant, deceptive, dim, crazy, weird, dystopic, stifling, uncaring, plantigrade, grim, unsympathetic, jargon-spouting, censorious, secretive, aggressive, mind-numbing, arassive, poisonous, flagrant, self-destructive, abusive, socially-retarded, puerile, clueless, and generally Not Good."

It\u2019s on the window sills, the bed frame, the fan, the leaves of my hanging plants, shoes I bought a week ago neatly tucked away in the closet. Every surface is covered in hair. And there\u2019s normal dust too\u2014a lot of it. Way, way more than any other room in the house and I don\u2019t have a clue why.\n\nI already have an air purifier. It\u2019s rated for way larger than this room. I try to brush/deshed my cat regularly but he really hates it for some reason and so he basically has to be pinned down by someone else. With that in mind, he needs to be brushed more often than he is.\n\nBut is there anything else I can do to help with this problem of the dust and fur collection on everything? Is there something else that could be making it worse in this specific room? I\u2019m so confused bc I go to other people\u2019s homes and I *know* they don\u2019t clean often but it\u2019s still nowhere near as filthy as mine even when I *do* clean often. \n\nAny advice is welcome!!!

The reviews are excellent. Very open to any other suggestions, though--especially if they're cheaper lol. I'm looking for 5 gallon, completely clear, something nice and simple and pretty. I'm going to put it on my dresser as a display piece type thing, and it'll cover part of the mirror, so that's why. With that, I want the filter on the side, but if it's just the tank without a filter then I can put a purchased one on the side...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy bigger question is what heater for this guy? I want something small, but I'm having a hard time finding ones with good, reliable reviews. A heater is the last place I want to play guessing games and accidentally fry my fish. I'm frankly just having a hard time finding 25W in general. Can I buy 50W for something so small? I don't need much of an increase.. we don't keep my house cold. I don't know how it works."

I'd also like some things to watch with my Dad as I'd love to share my passion with both of them. \n\nI asked my Dad what kind of movies he likes and he gave these examples:\n\n1. Historical fiction or \"based-on-a-true-story\" films, he likes when you can learn more about the details of certain time periods or real events that happened. He gave the examples of Titanic, Dunkirk, Glory Road, Invincible, or the original Midway. \n\n2. Romantic comedies or any \"feel-good\" movies that work out in the end, he likes movies that leave him feeling good and can be an \"escape\" from the negativity of the real world. He gave the examples of Casablanca (his all-time favorite), Sleepless in Seattle, Rocky, My Best Friend's Wedding, It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, and When Harry Met Sally. \n\n3. Suspense thrillers that give him a \"sensational feeling.\" He prefers them to be \"believable\" like Psycho or Silence of the Lambs over something like Godzilla, which he thinks is too unrealistic to be thrilling. He also listed the Mission: Impossible and James Bond series, Die Hard, Sleeping with the Enemy, and The Sting as movies with suspense he enjoyed. \n\n4. Slapstick or comedies with relatable humor about everyday things. He loves The Naked Gun, Airplane!, the Johnny English movies, Planes Trains & Automobiles, and Charlie Chaplin's The Champion to give you an idea. \n\n5. He also mentioned that he DOESNT like unrealistic action movies like the recent superhero films where \"they have all these crazy powers and it just devolves to two dudes punching each other.\" He's fine with sci-fi or fantasy as long as it retains some level of realism/believability, and he mentioned Star Wars and Harry Potter as things he likes in that realm. \n\nI had a few ideas of things we could watch together such as Barry Lyndon, Alien, Chaplin's Modern Times, or even some of Kurosawa's period films. But I'd love to hear your thoughts on what we might enjoy together!"

As far as I remember I've been doing this.\n\nThe stories are often related to current events that happened to me, but can take place at any time (I'd say early 20th century to mid 21th century when it's my 'own', can have any date when it's a book). Whenever I'm reading a book, I spend more time imagining myself in the story or adding new characters to it, then I spend actually reading it. It's the same with tv shows and movies.\n\nThere's usually a main character, a character I focus on more. This character is most often female and a few years older than me (as I get older the main characters get older too), but this is pretty much the only thing I have in common with my imaginary main character. It can also be an older and/or improved version of myself, and can have different age and/or gender.\n\nThe themes of my daydreams have changed drastically throughout the years. They always change with my interests. Looking back on storielines I had years ago, the characters got much better, more diverse and more realistic (idk if this makes sence, they got more realistic even in fantasy and sci-fi worlds, I mean their relationships and personalities). Another change is that as a kid I used to daydream a lot about my future, and the main characters were more similar to me. Now I'm daydreaming about being completely different people, and I have future stories but mostly not related to me, and I have paralel timelines, mostly in this universe.\n\nThe stories affect my emotions, too. I often smile cry or laugh because of something happening in my daydreams.\n\nI've always felt a little off abou these, I've never told anyone. For example when someone (family) asks me what I was thinking about ('cause not doing anything for an hour is a little strange), I answer \"I don't know\".\n\nDoes this sound like mdd to you? If it does, should I do something about it? Should I tell anyone?\n\nI'll go to bed soon, I'll go throught the comments in the morning, if I get any.\n\nIf something is wrong or does not make sense pls tell me. (It is midnight, my brain might not function properly.)\n\nOh, and I'm 15/f, if that matters."

But something happens whenever I express sexual interest in someone or someone expresses that form of interest in me - I start shaking. I don\u2019t know how to react. I don\u2019t know what to say, I\u2019ve never had the experience and I feel entirely out of touch with my sexuality. But it\u2019s still there. I still have a very sexual side to myself that I seriously long to express!\n\nI think the reason this feels so uncomfortable is cause male sexuality is constantly understood as something dirty and something to be ashamed of. I was just reading an article earlier this morning that talked about how so many public sex columnists are women since it just seems like \u201cdirty locker room talk\u201d for a man to talk about his sexual desires.\n\nI think it\u2019s also still based off this idea that all men just want to \u201cdominate\u201d women. And being a guy who spends most of his time as a token straight in queer friend groups, I can say with confidence that this is just outright false. People, including men, are so much more complex then we frame them to be.\n\nTo me, what I hope is that men can view sexuality not in terms of hierarchies but in terms of different desires. What roles do we want to play? What really turns us on - but like, what \u201creally\u201d does? When removing all preconceived ideas of being a man, and all the pseudo-biological nonsense of what we want, what still lies underneath? We need to stop overcompensating our sexual shame by trying so hard to be \u201cworthy\u201d through earning money, getting swoll, or whatever else were told to do.\n\nThere\u2019s still so many parameters I haven\u2019t addressed, but I think it would be really cool if we could just learn to confidently articulate the things we may be more embarrassed to admit. Like, for example, I still know very little about my sexuality, but I kind of feel like I\u2019d prefer to play a more submissive role. For that sort of thing, I feel like I need to learn to be sexually confident enough to articulate that without shame.",

I go back and forth myself between identifying as Demi or not, but I think for myself, I just have to have emotional connection to be able to enjoy sexual connection. I still feel sexual attraction fairly early on, but if there\u2019s no emotional connection, flirting just feels painful to me.\n\nSo she\u2019s told me she\u2019s Demi and I think shes a lot more on the spectrum then me. During the time we were officially dating, they always told me that they were mostly attracted to me in an intellectual way. Like in a way that she just wants to pick my brain about everything and have really deep conversations. We kissed once, but right after that she revealed she was Demi and wasn\u2019t sure if she felt physical attraction. Then we went out for drinks one night where she revealed to me that she always falls in love with her best friends and that\u2019s always ended up causing a lot of trouble for her. In a conversation later that month, she told me that she just needs a solid foundation of friendship with any important connection she has, following up \u201cjust trust me on this one.\u201d Since then, we haven\u2019t been officially dating but we somehow always end up being one on one and talking for hours.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve definitely come to the point where I\u2019m sure I\u2019m sexually attracted to her, and I can\u2019t deny that I really want to be more than just friends.  But it just feels so weird because part of me feels like I\u2019d be really disappointed if we end up just being friends. There\u2019s a part of me that feels worried that our friendship will be insincere because I want to be physically intimate. As if I\u2019m waiting for her to catch up to me, and that just doesn\u2019t feel right. I almost feel like I gotta avoid becoming too attached to them, but it\u2019s so hard not to when all she wants to do is show me music and ask me deep questions late at night.\n\nI guess I just could use more input from other demisexual people on this situation. What do you need the most from your emotional connections? How can I make sure I\u2019m being sincere with them? How can I make sure I\u2019m looking out for myself?"

I accidentally walked on stage in between songs and knew the best thing to do would be to join the chorus in the next song. After that, I left and saw him later. I apologized and he told me that I made his show fantastic. Then I found my friends and family and we went to the venue for our own show, but our seats were facing directly away from the stage."

Every episode feels so fulfilling to watch. It starts getting pretty deep towards the end of book 1 especially. The character development makes this show very likeable, and just witnessing what everyone is going through has me locked in. Frankly, I didn't think an adolescent show would captivate me this much. I definitely have to finish it and give it some time to digest, but I'd be lying if I said this isn't one of the best shows I've ever seen. I really only started watching it because I was trying to find where the \"blue spirit\" skin in Smite was from. When I saw a clip of him, I thought I'd give it a watch. I almost wish the show was longer, having 15 episodes left to watch now."

She is able to do the job she was hired for, that's why she's having him do a single task for her, not take over her whole job. As her pregnancy continues, she may have to drop different tasks and pick up other ones while she's pregnant (which is necessary for the survival of the species and should not be seen as an individual choosing to create a problem for everyone else) but pregnancy doesn't make you helpless and incapable of doing anything. If she's still working 100% of the time she's being paid, I don't see why that's a problem. You say you never burdened anyone else because of your pregnancy, implying that having someone else do a single daily task is a tremendous burden, but you also say your idea of maternity leave would include the entire pregnancy, where she would be paid the entire time while not working at all. In this situation, this guy would probably have to pick up her whole job until they find a replacement, and it would be a burden to all her coworkers. Additionally, instead of picking up 100% of her paycheck for working 100% of her hours, she would be receiving that paycheck while working 0%, and he'd still have to clean up otter shit. You make it sound like she's maliciously forcing him to do her job while she sits back and complains and she's literally just having him do one single task. It would probably be worse for her to have to clean up after the otters. My mom worked at a donut shop while pregnant and when opening up a container of peanuts threw up and passed out, which was very unproductive of her, I do not doubt that otter droppings, notorious for their stench, could do the same.",

I'm not saying that all FDS posters are college educated with great careers, but whenever they mention their jobs they're usually college educated, business owners or in high paying careers so they just expect to date men on the same level as them. Being a broke college student is normal for 20 year olds.\n\nA HVM is a man who is not a misogynist, does not watch porn (due to the sexual abuse behind the scenes, the impact of porn addiction on people's minds and relationships, etc (I can elaborate if you need)), is employed like most adults should be (or in college, just as long as he's pursuing his career and not relying on you to financially support him), values and respects his partner and reciprocates his partner's efforts in the relationship, can cook and clean and doesn't expect his partner to do all the work around the house, respects his partner's boundaries, has basic hygiene, cares about his partner's pleasure in bed as much as his own... I stole that from a post called 'FDS does not have high standards,' or something like that. It's kind of sad how low the bar is... but anyway, I don't see anything in your comment that disqualifies you.\n\nI am not saying that FDS is perfect though. The positive side is that it encourages women to have standards, addresses some of the issues women have in dating, and provides ways to avoid men who don't meet your standards. It also challenges the idea that women should stay with men who bring no value to their life.\n\nThe negative side is that there's too much criticism of men who don't deserve it. Obviously there's going to be some bitterness on a sub like FDS. Most women have been hurt by at least one man before, used for sex, or emotionally/sexually abused, but it's one thing to vent about those men and its another to harshly judge every man you see and rant about people who are just existing. No one should be labeled low value if they haven't even done anything. Like, my best friend is a single mom, if she were a man they'd call her low value just for existing, regardless of whether she was even dating or not. I think FDS is good if you can think critically and sort the useful stuff out from the rest. If there was an FDS-like sub that didn't tolerate the transphobia, homophobia, and straight up hatred of men (it's a dating sub... how can you hate on all men when you're looking to date them...) then I would join in a heartbeat.\n\nI'm not sure how the last part is a problem though. Of course it focuses on female pleasure, it's a female dating strategy. It's for women to find men who actually give a damn about them and therefore enhance their life. It shouldn't be unrealistic to expect your partner to bring value to your life... I don't see how it could create a power imbalance, it doesn't tell women to manipulate men or force them into a subservient position, according to FDS if someone you're dating shows red flags then you should just leave them and move on. No mind games, no trying to force them to care about you, just moving on.",

Maybe the sub has such a low quality because it is too small, so we have to consume every garbage produced here, which would never make it to hot if it had more people. But even then, when you post trash like that YOU COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THE COMMUNITY, which devalue the few good posts (that is not even one of them), so please stop.\n\nSecond - school doesn't get nearly enough hate. The final drop that triggered that post was an ACAB (all cops are bastards) meme. I seriously don't get people who hate the policemen for no reason. They prevent crimes like murder and robbery, and even if some of them are corrupt, the benefit from the outweighs the harm by a lot. Especially if you are a teen and have trouble with the police, then THE PROBLEM IS definitely YOU.\n\nTEACHERS on the other hand - few of them are decent people (talking from experience). Not to mention how THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE NEVER USES ANYTHING THEY LEARNED IN SCHOOL. THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN USE THAT KNOWLEDGE IS IF YOU CONTINUE YOUR EDUCATION IN UNIVERSITY, AND EVEN THEN YOU ONLY NEED ONE OR TWO SUBJECTS. However that doesn't stop a teacher from writing you a low grade, effectively gatekeeping the good universities for you, on a subject you understand nothing about, where you had to JUST MEMORIZE THE MATERIAL WHICH YOU ARE ANYWAY GOING TO FORGET IN 3 DAYS.\n\nBecause let's face it - nobody can specialise in all 15 subjects. And if you don't have the enough level of understanding on a certain subject, you are forced to simply mechanically memorize the information. \n\nOh, and of course, NOBODY ASKED YOU if you agree on going to school. They kept you in a room, tied to a desk all of the time for 6 hours a day, forced to do literally nothing. A 12 years prison sentence none of us deserved.\n\nAnd now school nutters will say it was justified, because school brought all the progress and everything good in that world. Maybe education brought everything we have, but certainly not school. THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM STEALS THE CREDIT FROM SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE, when it contributed nothing.\n\nAnd I can't wait for the moment there will be no school anymore. Maybe it will be after 200, 300, 500 years, but I can't wait for the day that world will burn."

They decided to go with the candidate who didn\u2019t have a master\u2019s but had a little bit of internship experience in the field somewhere else (literally 3 months; mind you that my master\u2019s took nearly 1.5 years). \nThat kind of crushed my confidence a bit. I mean, if the university that taught me what I know didn\u2019t choose me, why would anyone else? But, fair enough, the other person had experience, I didn\u2019t.\nSo, now, six months later, I have finally gathered the guts to try to move on from my current job again (not in an ID field). What would you suggest I could do to gain some feasible experience? Most jobs I see online have hundreds of applicants and require quite a bit of experience; all I have is the master\u2019s and a portfolio. Is there any entry level job in the ID field that carries a different title and doesn\u2019t require 3+ years of experience? I just want something solid (meaning, it will allow me to pay my bills), and that will get my feet wet in the field. \n\nThanks in advance for any guidance you guys may give me!"

Not that I want to play down the advice, but humor can be disarming and myself and my INTP brethren have build up their defenses for a long time (and I think you know some people like that too).\n\nFor example: instead of geting a job that goes nowhere, it's some money making while AFK, or instead of hustle, it's grinding for a Item or achievment, etc.\n\nMemes can be like rhymes (I haven't put any water in acid yet), but I want to go past simplified and generic. Sure, starting like that, but my vision would be an interactive flow. \n\nYou choose which cards you have been dealt and then look what you want to achieve. If we take my flowchart draft as an example: you're at the small bizniz step but don't know how. You could open up a new li9nked flowchart with advices specific to a small business, resources etc.\n\nBut it is mostly to learn and compile different ways of Life. Goals and paths you have in mind, hardships you've faced or fears and workarounds.\n\nMy Idea or wish would be to have a variety of people, those who have lost their way and those who want to follow a path or know where it leads.\n\nThe goals should be varied from people that want or have more wealth than some countries, to those that don't want to work anymore and are happy with silent and minimalistic.\n\nIf you want to live on the moon and do drugs or offgrid and prep for the zombie apocalypse. I'm interested, how do you want to achieve that, what are your backup ideas, do have an All In mindset or rather take it slow and save, but steady, or don't care if it goes forward or backward.\n\n  \n\\----\n\n  \nIf you like that Idea, here is the  [flowchart](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/155gCotOZj_xIepW4Bs1flZY3KEvIa7xj?usp=sharing), I made them with [diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net).  If they have some time to ripen, take them, change them, share them, right now it is not worth much.\n\nI would compile and discuss Ideas on Discord, and then implement them until everyone is happy. I don't know if it is possible to let multiple people work on one file and which service. \n\nI just hacked that chart together, if someone has ideas or knows how to make it better, that would be great. Need to read upon proper flowchart etiquette, but making them presentable is a problem... that can wait, and I need definitely help with it. \n\nThis would be the [Discord](https://discord.gg/vfJwJDmw), just for flowchart discussions, if you have something to change, to add, to disagree with etc. I don't want to replace this subs discord.\n\nThis would be my first public discord too, so help and patience is appreciated.\n\nA lot that I have to learn, but no one is going to do it for me. If I did something wrong, then I hope you can alert me."

Personally I run far away from anything 2% spandex because, after wearing it for like an hour, it stretches out and sags and looks super unflattering and it offers no support whatsoever. Try pants with 1% spandex at the most, but my original recommendation was to try 100% cotton denim. It will take a little getting used to, because it doesn\u2019t conform as much to your body, which is what you want because it supports you and doesn\u2019t let every little bump just \u201chang out\u201d. I personally like Levi\u2019s, they\u2019re pretty tried-and-true universally. Of course every body is different and you should try out a variety of brands and see what works for you.",

I wasn\u2019t too crazy about it but it\u2019s growing on me\u2026 idk.\n\nPros: I like that it sounds regal and dignified. I would rather give a boy a mature sounding name that he will grow into, rather than a boyish name that will be weird on a grown man.\nI also like that it\u2019s a classic name but not too popular like all the Liams and Benjamins. \n\nCons: it\u2019s just so hard to imagine calling a little baby/toddler a name like Byron! Maybe I could call him a nickname, like Bo. \nWhich is the other problem\u2026 kids might make fun of him and call him By or bisexual or something to that effect. \ud83d\ude44\nAlso our last name starts with M so initials would be BM \ud83d\ude02 I don\u2019t really associate anything bad with this but my parent\u2019s generation does.\nAlso afraid that he will have to constantly correct people that his name isn\u2019t \u201cBrian\u201d."

This is a kind of compound post of questions for others in this thread who have experience with pregnancy/having children.\n\nFirst, my husband and I are trying to get pregnant for the first time and of course I have another layer of extra concern because I have UC. I was diagnosed at age 20 and I\u2019m now 31. I don\u2019t take regular meds because they don\u2019t work for me, but when I get flare ups I will take prednisone and that works. When I have flare ups, I consistently lose a lot of weight from lack of nutrients. So I\u2019m afraid of not absorbing enough nutrients from my food to nourish the baby.\n\nSecond, a more scientific query, hah. So I\u2019ve heard that pregnancy can be worse with autoimmune disease, or can even trigger an autoimmune disease for the first time. BUT I\u2019ve also seen studies and this [interesting article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/06/women-autoimmune-diseases-pregnancy/591901/) that suggest that women who have more pregnancies are less likely to develop autoimmune diseases because pregnancy triggers a natural \u201cswitch\u201d that tells the body to not attack the baby or placenta, basically making the immune system not on such high alert, which in turn keeps it from attacking its own body also. It makes me wonder if my disease would be less severe if I had starting having babies earlier in life.\n\nMy questions: how did your body handle the pregnancy? Did you have any issues with your baby getting enough nutrients? Did you notice a change in your disease over time after pregnancy or multiple pregnancies?"

The game is technically in a disastrous state. The list goes on from official accessory (plus gadgets) not working properly all the way to the battle league. In my opinion Niantic is only milking the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, which manifests in hilarious prices for items that involve minimal effort to provide and held back Pok\u00e9mon to keep their players engaged. I think that\u2018s not right and we, as the players, should do something about it. What are your thoughts on this?"

It's entirely possible that you simply aren't looking in the right place, and simply expanding your horizons will help you learn what you enjoy, possibly find new interests. There are many challenges that can help with this if you don't know where to start. Reading a book from every country (or at least a few from every continent) is a popular way of reading outside of what you're used to. I also recommend [genre bingos](https://i.imgur.com/ESCaJ9Y.png), where you read books from 24 different genres every year (anything from absurdism, essays, theatre, romance, literary fiction, mysteries, etc., you can make your own). You can combine both in one: genre bingo where every book has to be from a different country.\n\n- Make a list of your all-time favourites and recent dislikes. Then, consider why you liked the books you did, what do they all have in common, and what things bothered you about the others. This will give you a set of guidelines to follow when looking for a new book.",

I get the \"you don't look autistic\" every time, without fail, but I can understand why. I can cope with things on a day to day basis and would only come off as somewhat weird, if that, in social situations. Most people don't know or care enough about autism to be actively rude about it.\n\nHowever, I've been unable to hold down a job for more than a year or two, and I dropped out of university. For me, the biggest problem has probably been selective mutism. There are situations where I'm unable to speak, and in a culture where participation in class and the workplace is encouraged / required, it has affected my grades and got me in trouble before. There have been times in a meeting where my boss just points to me and says \"Speak! Say something!\".

So not really an own innovation ... and still, these hot takes don't do the games justice. \n\nSanta Monica and FromSoftware have pushed their formulas and IPs so far and innovated so much, it's insane compared to other franchises.\n\nI do have my favourite and it's absolutely going to be super close in every category between those two except for narrative I guess.\n\nBut Jesus, some folks just talk shit about one of both and elevate the other into the sky, it's unbelievable. Just relax and remind yourself that both games are masterpieces in their own rights and can't be compared directly 1:1 since they offer vastly different things to the player.\n\nAt the end of the day it's going to be decided by the judges and it's anyone's guess what the GOTY 2022 will be just as it was with Ghost of Tsushima and TLOU Part II in 2020 (imo).",

I'm not too sure since I haven't played ER yet, just got some glimpses of stuff.\n\nMeanwhile tombs in the Tomb Raider games felt more like optional dungeons not hiding from but also not guiding players to them.\n\nMy point being: if we were to criticise tombs for being optional and missable then why is the same mechanic celebrated in other games (even more missable imo) for making the players explore more? Is it about how rewarding it feels to explore in each game? I honestly don't know but it could be.\n\nI think it doesn't hurt the game to make the player explore a bit but within reason of course.",

                "body": "Just like the title says my grandpa died today and I was at university when I looked at my phone for a change and read my mum's messages that he had died.\n\nI want to puke. I feel bad. I still hide the fact behind rationalisation since it would take time to accept it and I have to function right now. I'm on my way home and waiting for a bus and a lot of drunkards and idiots make it hard to be alone with my thoughts.\n\nThe story: He went to the hospital to get his gallstones washed ( I don't know how you say this, they wanted to get water into his gall to treat his stones since they hurt pretty bad and were big).\nNow this treatment basically only involved a 'cable' to get it there and pump some water in. They fucked up, damaged his gall and don't ask me how, he caught a lung infection and nobody could answer how. They only ever said he had high inflammation values and that they were pessimistic his heart could take it (2 heart attacks in late 90s, early 00s).\n\nSo it got worse and he was drugged so much he could barely speak and didn't recognize my grandma. They were both 73 and married since 18. She went home crying and could not sleep or eat anything. That's around the time last Monday / Tuesday that someone in my family decided it was a good idea to finally tell me, my grandma was basically dying in the hospital.\n\nIt got worse, they put him into intensive care. Nothing helped, they decided to operate and cut out his gall. It went well, the gall was out and brutally damaged. I understood it like this: part of it was due to the stones, the other part was the previous surgery attempt.\n\nThe doctors however had to put him to sleep using medication or rather put him into an artificial coma, I'm not sure. I was told mixed things but he was sleeping and alive in order to not feel the pain of the infection and the water in his lungs. \nThe water got in when he was unwell from the infection, had to puke a lot and some of it got into his lungs.\nThat's what the doctors said. My mum is pretty sure they fucked up and got water in his lungs during the first treatment. I don't know which is true, I don't care at this point, I cared about the water in his lungs.\n\nHis inflammatory values went down a bit but the doctors were pessimistic. According to them his heart would be the deciding factor. I tried to keep optimistic since thinking about him really dying made me want to break down. My grandma was not so optimistic. Life had left her, metaphorically speaking. My aunt could neither sleep nor eat. My mother was working almost all the time (as a  cleaning woman in this hospital) and visited him whenever it was possible. I don't know about my uncle but he visited grandpa, too. They are all his children.\n\nNow he had his consciousness once shortly before he was operated on his gull and he called my grandma and my aunt by himself and talked with them. After that they never woke him up even after they planned to once.\n\nIt just happened so fast. The hospital didn't call that his blood pressure had fallen and he was dying. It was by coincidence that my grandma noticed that since she went on her regular visit. My family called my uncle, aunt and mum together to be there for him. My mum keeps telling me grandpa heard everything and that he could understand them and that he reacted in some ways. She also said he understood what was happening and waited for my family to arrive and be with him there and he held on until they were with him and everyone was able to go in and be with him for a bit since they weren't all allowed because of the pandemic and rising numbers.\n\nInstead of helping or leaving my family be, the doctors rationalised the situation with statements such as \"Such things happen.\" \"Anybody dies.\" \"You could go out there and be hit by a bus or a truck.\" They proceeded to pack his stuff, put everything else away that my family brought and get the machines bit by bit while everyone was present. The doctor was \"on a schedule and had to hurry\".\n\nMy family and especially grandma was horrified. They basically were getting him off the machines while he was still breathing and even crying and my grandma had to wipe off his tears. Didn't stop the doctors... \"He's already dead, the machine is doing the breathing, the patient is already dead.\"\n\nThey said they didn't understand what caused his death but they could do an autopsy. They told my grandma that basically instantly after they got him off. \"His other organs were alright. He would have lived another number of years\". She was furious and if you ask me, rightly so.\n\nI talked with my mother so far, I'm dreading calling my grandma and aunt (she's staying with my aunt and is scared of going home now) and writing to / calling my uncle and my cousins.\n\nI haven't realized any of it yet. I know it now and I can work with it but my heart doesn't know yet. And if I try to accept it a little bit, I almost immediately start to cry. So I don't know what comes next now... I wasn't even in my home town and planned to visit my grandparents again and more frequently after they were vaccinated and me too. I feared I could infect them with COVID so I didn't visit them for the better part of 2 years.\nI got to see grandpa a few last times the last time I was at home in September / October.\nNobody thought anything would happen and everything would be routine... So I guess that's that...\n\n\nFor comparison / extra information: \n\n5 people (rather young) died in the same time range because of that same infect.\n\nI had a surgery once there (one of multiple) and they got me infected during surgery. Took almost a month and a university clinic to battle that infection. Our hospital \"could do nothing\"\n\nMum's colleagues jokingly say for years that if you wanna die (faster) you go to our hospital.\n\nTL;DR: Grandpa went to hospital to get his gall stones washed. Caught a lung infection during hospital stay / surgery. Had some water in his lungs. Got surgery and his gull was removed. They put him into a coma and for him off the machines today while I was in the lab at university.\n\nPlease don't award or like too much, but rather leave your honest opinions or useful information in the comments. I don't want Karma or anything, I need people's takes and the feeling of someone being out there right now.\n\nI told my gf about it and am going to go into the details since I am at home now but otherwise I have almost nobody I told this or want to burden them with something this heavy."

Maybe it's because the new season doesn't premiere until mid-September and the creators have more in store for us down the road.\n\nBut, the single trailer to such a huge and impact full series seems weird to me. Given the events taking place in the United States, you'd think we would be getting more details and also some political statements from the cast and crew. It would be the perfect time for them to say something."

He is no longer on an imaginary pedestal and it's now weird for me to think that he was ever on one.\n\nWhen he texts, I'm barely bothered to respond anymore in the way I did before. I respond in my own time.\n\nHe's a great person in my life who I value and who values me. He's a friend who sees and accepts me, which I think is all I ever wanted him to be.\n\n*How I got over it:*\n\n- I spoke to him more, got to know eachother more. I became a valued person in his life. He respects who I am.\n- Met more people/had new social experiences. First step here is the most important. Accept your limerence and push yourself into the first steps of having new social experiences, meeting new people (I don't mean romantically, just in general).\n\nI understand that it's very easy to isolate yourself from meeting new people when you're in limerence, but it's something you have to do. Do it through the limerence. It will be difficult at first and you might feel depressed because you think it's pointless. Accept these feelings but do it anyway. And don't stop.\n\nThink of it like this: you may as well feel like crap while moving forward rather than feel like crap while staying exactly where you are.\n\n(might add to this later)"

I do want to make money but not like this, I don't want to suffer for 6-7 years studying maths and physics. I'm 100% sure if I did I'll be depressed for those years or maybe even after that doing the same monotonous job.\n\nI was also thinking of doing MBA after my arts degree because that way I can study passionately for 4 years and then for 2 years I can work hard and get a well paying job after MBA but after my research I found out that there are really low chances of getting into a good college and a having a well paying job if you're going to do MBA after taking arts and doing BA.\n\nPeople of reddit, PLEASE HELP ME OTHERWISE MY HEAD WILL EXPLODE.

That way the player is satisfied, and our little lizard buddy gets his satisfaction too. \nIs there any way to permanently polymorph an animal companion other than True Polymorph? True Polymorph also has rules against increasing a target's CR (which I can ignore for this single exception I suppose). If the party progresses far enough, I'd like to \"upgrade\" the bearded dragon into a dragonet around level six, and into a young dragon around level fifteen. Any suggestions welcome."

Because repetitive practice ensures you hit those 2-4 free throws you may get in a game.\n\nIn static clicking, you move your crosshair from a point where there's no target, to a point where there is a target and you click. This is done multiple times in scenarios like ww4ts (consider this the 100-200 practice free throws). In most tac fps, time to kill is very low, so you have to make your shots count (2-4 free throws). The repetitive practice you've done will help you out in this scenario.\n\nHope this helps out and clears it up a bit for you :)",

                "body": "Hello all,\n\nOver two years ago, I created this account to document all the commissions I've gotten for various fandoms and ships. After two years, I can say I'm done... with this account.\u00a0\n\nOnce I hit 200K karma (or close to that), I will be deleting this account and remaking my Reddit.\n\nYou might ask why (~~or not, but I'm telling you anyway~~), and here are my reasons:\n\n1. My username is bad. When I first made this account, I just used the first two videogames I thought of (and was playing at the time), Genshin Impact and Final Fantasy 7. However, I realize now that this has made my username look less like a mashup of the two games and more of a mashup of \"Genshin Fantasy\", which is not what I was going for. It leads people to making false assumptions about me that I can't change. Reddit doesn't allow for username changes, so I want this account to go as a result.\n2. With how old this account is and with how some subreddits don't archive their old content, sometimes (~~many times, actually~~), I get comments on year-old posts/comments of mine fighting with me about stuff I don\u2019t care about anymore. Sometimes it's political issues, sometimes it's fandoms I'm no longer interested in, but regardless, I get multiple of these comments a week and it annoys the hell out of me. I usually ignore them but sometimes they just don't get the message and keep spamming me. Deleting this account removes all that.\n3. I have too many followers. Crazy, right? Reddit isn't a site about followers, but I have nearly 70 followers and that's too many people for me. I block and block, but I still get spam bots and so on following me. No thanks.\n4. Having NSFW/non-NSFW on one account makes people use this as a \"Gotcha!\" against me. For whatever reason, people insult me for posting NSFW art. Not sure why. I'm just gonna delete this account and separate NSFW/non-NSFW accounts in the future. \n\n\u00a0If you read this far, congrats! See you on the other side, whenever/wherever that may be."

Anyway ...\n\nI can\u2019t really find conclusive literature on the topic of reprisal killings (i.e. if our soldier dies, we kill of your 5/10/100 civilians).\n\nHowever, the only thing I did note was that in every instance where reprisals were actively enforced policy, the enforcers eventually lost. The Japanese and Nazis for example.\n\n\nBut even then, efficacy varied significantly. Reprisals in Yugoslavia involved 100 civilians for every 1 soldiers, yet Yugoslavian resistance was incredibly active and effective.\n\nMeanwhile, reprisals were less heavy-handed in France, yet the French Resistance was less active. In Manchuria, reprisals were described as decently effective in securing economically important areas until the end of the war.\n\nOn the one hand, you could argue reprisals work because people want to preserve their own lives. On the other hand, you could also argue that civilians will be angered by this policy. And of course it also ties into criminology and the effectiveness of deterrance in general.\n\nI would also assume that the further back you go in history, the more effective reprisals are, since the benefit of local fear outweighs the risk of public outrage in other regions.\n\nSo, any thoughts? Was there an effective (if extremely brutal) reasoning behind this, or were the occupiers just self-sabotaging?"

We've seen crypto help people in other dire situations (Venezuela, Argentina, Turkey etc). I remember reading about DAOs spontaneously forming to figure out how to flip animal NFTs for profits, so IMO this is the least ridiculous thing one could ask about. \n\n**What are some methods/projects that help people in the region in some way?** DAOs, anonymous donations, specific dev teams' initiatives etc.\n\nIf this thread gets any responses, I'll try to compile/point out obvious rug pulls etc. I'm not going to restrict it to purely the Ukrainian side, since ordinary Russians will be affected to a lesser extent as well, especially with sanctions.

He's having to fight 3 High Elven armies to get it, and has managed to neutralise 2 of those armies before crashing. So he'll forever be chilling at Dragon Gate, crumping Tyrion for the Sword of Khaine for eternity. I guess if anything, Taurox would consider this a win.\n\nWH3 apparently is harder to run, so RIP."

Then I realised: Here you have a newly elected public official who has never made life-or-death decisions being responsible for making countless such decisions across their term. They might have breakfast, read briefings, go on their morning jog, visit schools, have lunch with heads of states and authorise airstrikes somewhere in between, all while keeping a public image and maintaining a tight schedule. Voting for something as a representative is presumably very different from personally authorising a raid/invasion/airstrike. I'm curious given the different personalities that have been President, what the normal response was to this, and whether it had any lasting effects on them the way it does with soldiers, whose issues with PTSD are generally quite well-known. Is there counselling for Presidents who struggle with the guilt?"

Come to think of it, the whole situation was really wild.\n\nYou had literally millions of fighting-age men dying en masse for their country at the urging/lying of fanatical authoritarian regimes, which then ceased paying after being conquered. I assume whatever currencies their families were paid (if at all) became worthless by the end of the war.

As of Runes I'd run Electrocute/Sorcery, most likely, but overall it depends on the matchup you're against and how it would play out. As of the current state I would say it is *sliiiiiiightly* better than Kennen top lane, because it's ~~aids~~ to be against most top laners nowadays (Cause of second wind, doran's shield, and having literary 80% of the champions heal/shield out of some other sources while Kennen not being the best champion in the Early game).",

There is nothing more comforting than knowing that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the way I experience attraction. I am beyond glad to hear about communities that consist of aromantics, asexuals, a-specs, anyone in between, and supporters. \n\nI\u2019m confident with this temporary \u201clabel.\u201d It\u2019s really odd how people in my life are unsettled *for* me. It shows more about them than me. For example, I told my mom (who knows I\u2019m ace) how I haven\u2019t been attracted to anyone in a long time. I stated how I was fine with it. For context: my parents haven\u2019t had the best relationship, so I have a negative association with relationships. My adult siblings have mostly healthy marriages, but I\u2019m mostly around my parents. It may or may not be a factor of my aro/ace orientation. Who knows. \n\nAnyway, my mom said something along the lines of \u201cseriously? I think that\u2019s going to set you far apart from others. What do you think?\u201d It bothers me when she assumes that I don\u2019t think or consider these choices for myself. It bothers me even more when she says \u201cwhat do you think,\u201d because she\u2019s not asking what I truly believe, she\u2019s challenging my thoughts. It\u2019s just\u2026 frustrating. It\u2019s like \u201cplease just be happy for me, mom. I\u2019m happy with who I am. Isn\u2019t that enough? Isn\u2019t that what you want?\u201d I go through this every time I tell her something new about my orientation. It was like that when I told her I might be bi. When I told her I was ace, she said I\u2019d change my mind. At least when I told her I thought I was demi-sexual (and explained it) she somewhat accepted it. It\u2019s upsetting how some people always want me to open up and say new things about myself, but they get upset when I say things they weren\u2019t looking to hear. I\u2019ve stopped coming out to people who claim they are supportive of lgbtq+ but aren\u2019t accepting of the whole community. It\u2019s not worth the heartache. \n\n*sigh* :(\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sorry for the rant. Maybe some of you can relate. Accepting yourself is a tough process, but it makes a wonderful difference. In case anyone hasn\u2019t told you this today, I will: \u201cI accept you for who you are, and I believe in you just as much.\u201d"

That suppressed the symptoms so well I doubted even having the allergy anymore.\n\nI stopped allegra within three weeks, continued with a lower dose of ceterizine and around week 6, my dermat got me taking it on alternate nights. I barely developed any rashes on the days I didn't take it. Until my fool self went and got drunk on a night I didn't have to take the medicine. And since alcohols contain histamines, it was unbearable as hell. Like first day rashes all over again. So I'd recommend making note of histamine rich foods and staying a whole zipcode away from them. \n\nPresently, it's week 12 and I can now comfortably go every 3-4 days without taking ceterizine.",

I'm excited for you to pass it tomorrow. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nHere are some pointers for today's post:\n\n>> The book is 'the blade itself\" (I'm reading it in English to \"practice\") the first part of the trilogy.\n\nFirst, in English, according to both the modern Chicago and MLA style manuals, names of books (along with films, journals, and websites) are to be italicized.  Also, the first letter of each significant word should be capitalized.\n\nSecond, splitting this into multiple sentences would be ideal.  For example:\n\n- The book is called *The Blade Itself*.  It's the first book in a trilogy, and I'm reading it in English to help me practice.\n\n>> **I've** had this book on my to-read list first a long time,\n\n>> I didn't pick **it** up until yesterday.\n\n>> The majority of the reviews are really positive**,** so **my** expectations are high.\n\nAlternate, more natural: so I have high expectations.\n\nEither way, it's more natural to call them \"your expectations\" or to say that you \"have high expectations.\"\n\n>> At this point, (it seems to have potential, but only time will tell whether it can live up to the hype.)\n\nDon't forget the comma after an introductory phrase!\n\n\"Hype\" = extravagant or intensive publicity or promotion (i.e., raving about something)\n\n>> (Another book I read, which didn't meet that mark, was *Assasin's Apprentice* by Robin Hobb).\n\nGrammatically, books are written \"by\" people.  \"From\" sounds like you received a physical copy from Robin Hobb.\n\nStylistically, I strengthened the transition into the new sentence so that it emphasizes the connection between the two thoughts.  Also, I used a colloquial phrase of \"meeting the mark,\" which is another phrase meaning to meet expectations.\n\n>> It wasn't bad (per se)**,** but (it didn't live up to my expectations after so many people were raving about it).\n\nThis should be a separate sentence, so I separated it here.\n\n\"Per se\" = in and of itself.  You don't need to use it here, but it emphasizes your point and sounds very natural.\n\nDon't forget the comma after an introductory phrase!\n\nI made a few stylistic changes in this sentence too.",
