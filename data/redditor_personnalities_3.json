They broke up but are together again now. Currently my mom or anyone who thinks my dad cheated does not plan on asking him about it except me. Although I'm not sure, if I do ask him about it what will he do? That's what I'm afraid of, although I 100% believe he won't harm us I'm worried that he might leave our family again.

Probably not as fast in comparison to an ego death, still you learn and learn. Probably more than an average would learn in a lifetime.\nHowever human curiosity sometimes takes over and when it does, I want to be prepared. \n\nWould you personally say you could have done something to prevent such a harsh outcome?

                "body": "I've always had surrealistic dreams, nightmares about creepy pastas (especially as a child) and in many dreams I even died without actually waking up (which was very interesting because every time I thought I'd be dead but then there was only my brain talking to me).\nI can't remember a single dream that was actually realistic. It never happened that I woke up and thought \"hm, this could actually happen today\". No, not even the laws of physics would allow it. \nHowever I find my dreams fairly interesting and I love interpreting them. It always feels as if there were symbolic messages or something behind them. \n\nAnyways... so since a year or so different kinds of dreams started coming up. At the moment I have them on a regular basis (2 times every week or more) and I had to Google this up, but that didn't give me as many information on these dreams as I have hoped for. \nThese dreams are very hard to describe and they feel insanely long. There are probably multiple \"loops\" I forgot by now.\n\nThese dreams usually start with a \"normal\" situation. Today it was me meeting up with a friend. We wanted to go out to the city to have some drinks and celebrate. So we just teleported there and went into a club. After literally two seconds I was really drunk (without even drinking anything) and my brain ended this whole scene with waking me up in a VR game, which I played for a while until I forgot how I even got the VR headset on. Took off the headset, still saw the game graphics until my brain made up a new scene which formed directly in front of my eyes. \nThought to myself \"I played for way too long... Wait, why and how am I in my grandparent's old house?!\". \nI started becoming anxious. My great grandmother died in there and there should be living other people by now so I got out, into my car and tried driving to my actual home. While driving I called my mom and wanted to tell her what the heck I just dreamt. She listened and I heard her farting xD. \nI somehow teleported home, waking up in my actual bed, telling my friend from the beginning about this crazy dream I just had. \n\nThen my mom opened the door very loudly. I actually woke up. In reality I slept for about 30 minutes and I was so confused. I tried to tell my friend about this dream but couldn't put it as well together as I did when I was telling my mom in the dream. \nHowever as I said I have dreams like these very often right now and I'm just wondering what it means. When I'm inside them I always feel like I am getting insane. Especially because some of them are very scary. \n\nIn another one some kind of demon was possessing me and killed dozens of people, he left my body and I was devastated about what I just did. I morphed into another dream and there were ghosts everywhere in the background watching me. I was very scared and teleported into different scenes multiple times in that dream. It was very stressful. The ghosts from the background came closer with every new scene. The dream ended horribly with a girl surviving my demon attack, who wanted to forgive me and hug me. She only had one arm and no legs, her entire body was distorted and horrormusic started when she turned around. I was shocked, turned around and a ghost stood right in front of me. I actually woke up and had an incomparable feeling of shock and horror. I will never forget this dream."

It's been said that the game will not have atmospheric flight (i.e. flying your ship around the planet like in No Man's Sky and other games). But how exactly is it going to work then? Do you just fly to the planet and a loading screen will play and suddenly you're landing at some random spot? What about landing at outposts or settlements or cities? Most planets won't even have those, they'll be empty and vast planets where you can land anywhere. How is it possible that you can't fly around and pick a landing spot? It seems a bit odd to me that you have a spaceship but can't choose where to land? If there's no atmospheric flight I can't see how this is going to work from a gameplay mechanics standpoint.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is when you enter the atmosphere of a planet the \"loading screen\" is some kind of map projection of the planet where you can choose where to land and you're presented with a landing animation at that spot. Kind of like fast travel in previous Bethesda games. Which isn't terrible but for a space exploration game it kinda feels like it's limiting the exploration part."

Allowing you to hear more of the game's rarer and beautiful pieces of music as you explore the world. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* New Location Discovered stingers now play again when outdoors (were removed from the game).\n* New blizzard and heavy fog music events trigger their respective audio tracks to play.\n* Trepidation now plays more frequently.\n* Clearing now plays more frequently (pretty sure Hinterland broke this track and that's why it never played).\n* The Pleasant Valley track from Episode 3 now plays when exploring Pleasant Valley during the daytime (at random).\n* Removed wolf stalking music.\n* Minor customization options in the Mod Settings menu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo install simply follow the instructions on Github. \n\nHope you guys enjoy this one!"

And why is she not 'real' now?\n\nThe only pearl that wasn't accounted for that everyone seems to forget about was the one in Lawrence. The original Dolores was wiped and the other copies were killed. \n\nBut Lawrence was a pure copy of Dolores just put in a host body. It wasn't put into a host copy of a human like Hale was. The copy in Lawrence wasn't trying to mimic a human life since Lawrence was just a host with a fake backstory. Wipe the backstory and start clean with Dolores' memories in that body. Meaning while the original Dolores got wiped there's still another version of her out there. And I highly doubt it had deviated much since. \n\nIt's highly possible that was part of Dolores' plan all along. A failsafe/backup plan. If her plan were to fail, Lawrence would go out into the desert or somewhere far where he couldn't be tracked, containing the final pearl of Dolores. \n\nI think Hale must've found it anyways and used that pearl to bring Dolores back to life, but not in a physical form. I think Dolores not being real is Hale's first encounter with transcendence.\n\nHale is transcending hosts but she would've needed to know it's possible/exists first. I think Dolores' last pearl was the first attempt at transcending. It wipes the memories of the host and puts them... somewhere. I think that since Dolores transcended, she lost her awareness but gained the world and the ability to control it. Hale was using her in some way to do something... maybe test transcendence.\n\nBut since Hale is now dead and the tower destroyed, her transcendence is no longer anything speciai. Her affects on the real world are limited and now she's basically a lost host stuck on some remote server somewhere that needs to escape. \n\n/theory"

She seems manipulative to me, at worst; or at best, just really self centered. \n\nWhat was your original reason for telling her and how did you expect her to react?

A good dom will be aware of what a sub consents to, what kind of after care they require if things go in the wrong direction.

I feel like she was just using me the whole time to control him, and I felt really stupid for not seeing through it and for doing her bidding.\n\nSo, after deliberating for a bit, I did block her. We didn't hear from her again, until a couple of days ago she called my cell to tell me that she had turned off her food stamps phone (it was her last bit of control over him) and that she had stage 4 pancreatic cancer so that I should tell him that he wouldn't ever hear from her again, and not to worry.\n\nHe luckily didn't need the phone anymore because she'd been threatening to shut it off for weeks, so I got him a phone card and he's got a new number and she doesn't know it. But...she knows my number. And like--I still feel pulled into her stupid bullshit somehow. Like, I'll just be laying down trying to sleep and start worrying things like \"What if she really is dying and this is the only chance he'll get to say goodbye to her and I'm a terrible gf if I don't try to encourage him to say goodbye while he still has a chance,\" or \"maybe I should reach out to her and try to get her to write him a letter for later when he does change his mind,\" but like, I think it's my own issues with abandonment and my own mom's bullshit. I don't know if I could forgive myself if mom was dying and I didn't go see her, no matter what terrible shit she's done to me.\n\nBut I don't want to subject him to the same kind of guilt that I'm constantly feeling. It seems like he's made up his mind about how he wants to handle things. And I honestly don't even know if she's even actually dying. I think that's the worst part of all this. Like she somehow knows exactly what to say to make me doubt myself and feel like I'm the worst piece of shit in the world, and I don't know how I even ended up feeling like I owe her anything in the first place. Also, how in the heck can he even sleep right now? \n\nI feel like I'm the crazy one for not being able to handle this insanity."

Why did she have to ruin it? Why can't I go back to being happy? Today is ruined. I feel like my life will be hell as long as she's living here. I don't want her to suffer alone, but I can't take this anymore and I hope I don't forget feeling this way because I don't want to get hurt when I feel safe again."

(I can barely go through easies n im rusty rn), is there anything i should do to prep other than leetcode?"

I saw on the cs sequence that coop after first yr is optional but I found an internship and thought it would be worthwhile to just add it as a coop credit. I sent in an appeal and heard back that I'm allowed early entry into the coop program. I was also told of a bunch of things I didn't realize I'd have to do \ud83d\udc80 like work term report/pay some fees. \n\nNow I'm in a dilemma because the only reason I want to stay in coop is because of the sequence. Technically for my grad year the first coop would be Summer 2023 & Fall 2023. If I drop out of coop, would I be allowed to just not enroll in courses for Fall 2023 so I can still find internships on my own during this time and next summer.\n\nCan I also unappeal an appeal/reverse it\ud83d\udc80? I don\u2019t want to pay or write reports lol, do I just email back saying \u201cnvm i don\u2019t want to do this anymore\u201d?\n\nNot sure how this works\ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"

How can you prevent problems like slavery that will inevitably rise with the absence of government? What if your neighbour decides to take your property?

                "body": "My life was basically on pause during my 20s. I rarely socialized and spent copious times alone. I felt like I was doomed to be forever alone with a revolving door of acquaintances who I get bored or who get bored of me. I felt nearly completely invisible and disconnected from society. I even wrote a song about how I felt I don't feel like I'm a part of society and am merely a spectator of humans interacting in society. I was dealing with undiagnosed bipolar, anxiety, and ADHD that crippled be to the point of being bed ridden for days at the worst (\\~50% of the time). At my very best (\\~5% of the time), I merely felt okay with mild anxiety and depression. Most of the time, I felt moderate to high levels of depression, anxiety, apathy, lack of motivation, fatigue, and slothfulness.\n\nAt 30 (in 2013), I moved to another state thousands of mile a way with a carry-on suitcase and backpack. People often say changing your surroundings won't help you with your mental issues and that change has to come from within but for me, moving forced me out of my shell. Also, Albert Einstein is misattributed as saying,\"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results\", but I proved that quote wrong after attempting to move to a particular city 3 separate times for 1-6 months in 2002, 2009, and 2011 until I moved for good in 2014, which yielded much better results than the previous false starts. The first few months were tough,; I hopped between many different temp lodgings (I moved about 8 times in the first 5 months). I also had just begun taking an SSRI a couple days after landing in the new city, which killed my appetite, caused me to sleep 12 hrs a day, and feel even more depressed/anxious for 2 weeks before things stabilized. You can imagine the turmoil I felt being a stranger in a new strange place feeling zombified as I attempted to build myself a new life.\n\nLong story short, I started going to Meetups and forced myself to socialize. I think taking the SSRI helped me feel less anxious and more optimistic about life. I was then diagnosed and treated for bipolar in 2017 and ADHD in 2018, which has further improved my life. I then started therapy in 2020. \n\nWhat also helped tremendously was heavy intense powerlifting, which I started in 2014. Prior to that, I was half-assedly doing bro splits. Having clear-cut goals and being able to track progress helped me stay the course. Also, I feel remarkable after intense workouts, and it's the best drug imaginable. I have to also mention the importance of eating and sleeping well for my overall well-being.\n\nThe pandemic caused me to slide back to my reclusive and depressed ways, but I managed to crawl out of that dark hole. I have found a community of supportive and uplifting people. I've also been dating and living a life that's a faaaaaaaaaaaaaar cry from my solitary and depressed 20s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;Dr: My life was on pause in my 20s. Moving, getting treated for mental issues, powerlifting, prioritizing sleep, eating well, and putting myself out there helped me emerge from a decade+  depressing and isolating rut.",

B and I run in overlapping social circles, and I've talked with her very briefly and all our correspondences have been very short and awkward. I've never got an indication she even liked me at all let alone wants to jump my bone. But I've only really talked to her before M told me B likes me.\n\nI recently told M I started dating after a loooooong hiatus and hit it off really well with someone we'll call Hottie. M's demeanor becomes very flat and terse whenever I bring up Hottie.  When I first told M about Hottie, I mentioned she has a son who lives in another country with the ex-husband, M said that's very weird they live apart, and that it says a lot about Hottie's character. Any other time I've brought up Hottie, M will often just ignore me or change the subject. I've told M that I rarely fall in love and when I do it's very intense. M kept insisting I fall in love very easily and shouldn't just go with the first person who really likes me. M also keeps inviting me to events where B would be in hopes of sparking a love connection; sometimes M tells me B will be there, sometimes not but I know she will.\n\nM is also trying to make plans with me with some projects but insists Friday is the only day when we can after rescheduling. I think she knows I'll be with Hottie on Friday and is doing all she can to get me  to not be with Hottie. I asked M if we could reschedule next week, but insists she will be insanely busy all next week and Friday is the only we can meet up.  I never told M I was going to be with Hottie on Friday and have backed off talking about her and regret bringing up Hottie with M. Halp!"

This took me by surprise, but I enjoy the attention. I wasn't sure if that's just how she is normally or if it meant anything significant. I brought up the topic of being exclusive a couple times but her responses were brushed off and were open-ended without a clear \"hell yeah!\". We've had sex since the 2nd date and have gone on 5 dates going onto our 6th. On one hand, she's all over me in person and is always down to hangout (but never initiates dates) and always texts after ours dates how she had a great time. On the other hand, she seems to want things to remain casual. I'm quite introverted and she's super extroverted, so I wonder if my initiating 3 or so dates a week to her signals I'm just wanting things to be casual? She did say I'm free to come over whenever I want, but I'm just not used to being around people so frequently. I'm leaning heavily on wanting something serious with her, but I don't want to come off as needy or moving too quick."

I've initially written them off as platonic, but I'm currently dating someone that's escalated super fast, and I suspect it will crash and burn. I'm tired of this trend and am looking for something long-term but for some reason I just find it hard to motivate myself to plan meet ups with women I'm not intensely into.

You are the one who is negative and sick\u201d) and I let that be replaced with all the positive messages I know and hear about myself from others.\n\nThe other really useful concept I have learned about is learned helplessness. There are so many things I did not do because I thought that I could not. Just drifting along the shores of life getting moved by the waves but never standing on my own two feet and choosing for myself where to go. I am learning to take some of those actions now instead of just hoping for good things to come my way and always bracing myself for the bad.\n\nI do slip back into collapse sometimes. There right now in fact. But the difference in the moments I can overcome it is what makes life worth living \ud83d\udc96",

This term definitely describes me more, but I've never heard of anyone using it, and I know of tons of people who identify as bigender and experience gender the same way as I do. To be honest, I'm not even sure if bigenderfluid is a real thing, because both google and my computer are trying to autocorrect it. So, what do you think about the term? Is it even real? Should I use it if it more accurately describes me, or could I keep using bigender? If I do stick with bigender, will it technically be incorrect?"

Can bigender people feel like they're more on a spectrum between their two genders, or does it have to be some days distinctly one and others distinctly the other? For example, I think I might be bigender with the two genders being female and non-binary, because most days I either feel very feminine or very non-binary. But, there are some days, (like today), in which I can't really tell which of the two I feel like, and it seems like I may be somewhere in-between the two. I know this sounds more like gender fluid, but if I'm always on a spectrum between two specific genders, can this still be considered bigender?\n2. My other question is more about how other people perceive you. Have you found that being bigender is confusing to other people? I feel really bad switching pronouns and stuff like that on other people depending on the day. I'm probably just going to accept she/they no matter what type of day it is, because I feel bad, but in general, do you think your gender confuses others?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my questions, and I hope you answer them! Thanks again if you do."

What a novel idea, being able to run your engines to their maximum capacity without a timer is great.\n\n\\-I am using this to rant about Great Battles, how am I supposed to remember I have one minute of WEP, or 5 minutes of maximum Combat Power while in a dogfight? I don't know about you, but my internal clock just isn't that good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAerial Gunnery:\n\n\\-Shooting in this sim feels very realistic to how I imagine it would be in real life. Bullets and cannon rounds feel much more weighty and not as much like lasers. Wing-mounted cannons especially feel much harder to aim.\n\n\\-Pulling off snapshots also feels much harder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAI:\n\n\\-While fighting against AI in CLOD feels harder, like all sims, the AI is not great.\n\n\\-Instead of flying in straight lines as AI does in Great Battles, they roll around erratically, but not in a realistic way imo.\n\n\\-AI also doesn't know how to shoot. They can line up right behind me and shoot 10 feet above my aircraft for a few seconds before finally aiming lower. \n\n\\-Edit: According to the comments below, the AI's difficulty can be adjusted to fix the aforementioned problem. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuick Side note:\n\n\\-Oh how nice it is to fly a P-40 without the engine killing itself when you sneeze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, I have enjoyed this sim, and CLOD and Tobruk are great. The sim definitely feels dated, but holds up well and excels in certain areas over the Great Battles series."

Also I am not very good at imagining things so is there a method that doesn\u2019t require that.Has anyone been able to do it, and is it possible to shift to an anime universe since I\u2019ve heard mixed opinions about it. Also are you supposed to do the method and then just open your eyes and appear in your desired reality or are you supposed to do the method and go to sleep and then wake up and your desired reality. I would really appreciate it if somebody could give me detailed instructions on the easiest fastest way to do it"

                "body": "#Ul'thraki/Horndallish\n\nFor the real juicy information about Ul'thraki, skip the next 3 paragraphs\n\n**How it Began**\n\nThis is by far my most intracate conlang, which isn't saying a lot at all. Ul'thraki was created after I \"re\"discovered the joys of conlanging & lesrnt the ipa. I, needing inspiration then asked someone if they needed help making a conlang for their fictional world, then we fell out of touch before he knew I even started it. He came up with one basic sentence, knew the language would be mostly agglutinative (he gave me a lot of suffixes to work with) & told me the word order was SVO. He left it at that though.\n\n**Goals & Inspiration**\n\nEven though it really doesn't have a purpose anymore except bringing me joy and accomplishment, I still like to keep the goals I had for it still in function. **Ul'thraki is a *very* simplistic language spoken by idiotic and scary people with horns and tusks. It's meant to sound *somewhat* naturalistic, and is meant to be functional in a story-like setting.** I don't really have inspiration for it and just go by what sounds good to me, which might be dangerous; I sometimes look at Slavic langauges to say \"I want it like that\" but don't do enough research to expand on that LOL. \n\n**The Process**\n\nI began by assigning sounds to characters (I had no choice but to make it have a Latin script, which is what I prefer and was probably better for me but if given the choice I most likely would've made a script for it. Following Biblidarions conlang instructions as I was still kicking my feet in the high chair was extremely helpful as I continued, formalizing the syntax, grammar, word and sentence formation, and now, the lexicon! It's been a long process for sure, but really fun. I've also taken expanding the lexicon in a really slow way, adding about 3-10 words a week (thanks to the bi-weekly telephone game in r/conlangs. REAL lifesaver!)\n\nThe following documents are still very much a work in progress, and you'll find that I very much have no idea what I'm doing, but they exist anyway. A lot of things don't exist yet and I'm still hammering it out. \n\n* [Grammar, Syntax and a few other things.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C3Zq_hvfpgA_qEDCiPCrII2W71wW4QQ608KDmyyeLJQ/edit?usp=drivesdk)\n* [Phonetics, Syllables & Other Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MRFuEiNkdnVRuYR8jZBlthAGMoKPS42H9zFujnl1HuY/edit?usp=drivesdk)\n* [Essentially a Lexicon?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VrLoFzbBmrfMuoFh_U_ran3D_f12odCD4hcZHoMXQnc/edit?usp=drivesdk)\n\n#Gwai'non Language\n\n**How It Began** \n\nA dear friend and I were in a voice call in early 2021 and she was gushing about how much she loved a certain race of humanoid (created by the same guy mentioned in Ul'thraki above) and how she had taken initiative to expand their culture and had already started a langaugs for them. Neither of us knew very much about conlanging back then so Gwai'non Langauge was really just flying by the seat of our pants LOL. Neither of us knew what the ipa even was, so all the sounds were really just misinformed English renditions of the words we created. \n\n**How it Functions**\n\nIn many ways, it is just reflavored English, however it does have some interesting features like semi-agglutinative words and lots of Categorizing cases. It's kind of a mess but it works, and the collaboration with my best friend is what easily makes it my favorite conlang even though it doesn't see as much use as it did in the past. We drew tons of inspiration from Celtic langauges. \n\n**Goals and the Process**\n\nThe goal is really similar to Ul'thraki's, minus the part about scary horned humamoids xD. The speakers of Gwai'non, are Gwai'non! Naive tree huggers with hearts of gold. Our other goal was to just have fun while making it. We were both stressed at the time and even considering forcing ourselves to expand the conlang further seemed so off-putting. We only ever made words when we needed to and it was really just a chill process that I'm obsessive over reminiscing about.\n\n#Slothish\n\nSlothish is a MAJOR work in progress that I'm not quite ready to release information about expect for the fact that it'll be super personal to me and probably have a main use of writing in journals and essentially becoming a 3rd language to think in."

Think back not so long ago, when you really tussled with something but you FINALLY overcame it - do you remember how good that felt in that moment? The weight off your shoulders, the lightness in your body? Can you remember now, how satisfying was that for you? The weightless, freeing, appreciative state you basked in? \n\nThink of the many many many things you've already accomplished, my friend. All throughout your life. Think of how much love, how many opportunities, how many wonderful people, and how much growth has already found you. \n\nKnow that these improved feeling-states are constantly seeking you out. Everything you desire desires you, and it's all we can do to recognize how much has ALREADY unfolded perfectly for us. \n\nYou are more divine than you know. I'm so serious. Focus your attention on the good alllll around you today. You don't have to look far. Call a friend, pet a dog, move your body in a way that feels great for you, sing a song you love, cook yourself a meal with love, support others, and allow yourself to live in a state of delicious appreciation for all that has already unfolded and all that is here for you. \n\nWatch how easily & how effortlessly everything starts appearing in front of you.

Now Fallout 3 asked me to put original CD into the optical drive in order to play it. I can install Fallout 3 using that .iso files, but when trying to play, it asked for CD.\nIs there a way to play Fallout 3 without CD?"

The torrential heat made the air vibrate.\n\nTwo figures appear at the two opposite north and south horizons. The first from the south approached in a military jeep wearing sunglasses. He wore a beige suit with a beige and brown intertwined striped tie.\n\nThe second individual approaching from the north horizonwore a suit in color dark Sienna with a purple tie. It was aboard a horse and wielded an ornamental sword made of sordish steel. Once they both got to the center of the designated battlefield (the village center) they both got out of their vehicles. Once they both got off their identities were clear. Wiktor Smolak got out of the jeep, while Maartin Van Hoorten  got off the horse.\n\n\"your wiktor time has come! \" van hoorten exclaimed, on guard .\n\n\"to hell with this\u201d wiktor replied pulling out a saber tied to his belt.\n\nThey both charged each other. Wiktor was the first to charge by attempting a saber assault from above. He was promptly stopped by the ornamental sword (claymore) which parried with a Prime parry (parry 1). immediately after the parry promptly with an impeccable technique maartin attempted a swing but wiktor immediately dodged by retreating back to avoid the blade of the sword. The healthy reformist democracy of agnoglia allowed him an absolutely perfect technique at a lower speed. While the steel of agnolia allowed him an absolute defense. Wiktor taking advantage of maartin's slowness in returning to guard after the swing to perform another attack aimed directly at the head but was dodged by maartin by lowering his head quickly and backing up quickly before wiktor could attempt another attack and barely made it in time. Wehlen's dictatorial government allowed wiktor a coarser but faster technique which combined with wehlen oil gave him almost unlimited stamina to be able to charge many times fastly.\n\n\"WHY WON'T YOU DIE?! \u201dWiktor exclaimed attempting yet another failed assault against maartin's impenetrable guard. \"I will never die against the leader of a dictatorship that kills innocent bludus!\" maartin answered.\n\n\"BULLCRAP! I only protect my country from the BFF terrorists! \"wiktor replied screaming.\n\n\"but poor innocent bludus die because of this civil war! \u201dreplied maartin starting to charge wiktor.\n\n\"it's a civil war! It is normal for civilians to die! Even civilians from my nation are killed! \u201dWiktor replied, charging it against maartin as well.\n\nJumping into each other they both attempted a vertical swing from top to bottom with their swords. The result of this meeting went down in history. But it will not be revealed to you."

Two miserable men with no hope in their eyes argued. on the caravan in  front of rayne who was hidden by her wine purple cloak with yellow stitching. \"After  the bombs fell we are in disgrace ...\" said the first desperate. \"God has forsaken us ...\"  said the second and then immediately after having a coughing fit. \"Believe in  sordland and his people for the future,\" rayne replied to the two men. \"What do you  foreigner want? Don't you know that sordland is dead and gone ?! \u201dthe first man  replied agitatedly. \"You are my enslavement and my freedom, You are my flesh  burning like a raw summer night, You are my country.\" Rayne promptly replied. \u201cAnd  do you think a cheap poem changes anything? We have heard this poem since we  were children and it still makes no sense! \" the man now answered furiously. \"Most  people only know this part of the poem and therefore don't understand its meaning,\"  rayne replied calmly. After a few seconds of silence rayne continued: \"You are the  green silks in hazel eyes, You are big, beautiful and triumphant, And you are my  sorrow that isn't felt, the more I feel it ...\" enlightened by such beautiful words but the  second distrustful giving against rayne's words exclaimed pointing at the window:  \u201cthese are now the men who represented sordland!\u201d. the man was pointing in the  distance two men whom rayne immediately recognized were iosef and the general valken fighting. \u201cThey come together every week to fight in this area! If our  leaders cannot agree what future is there for this wasteland?! \u201dHearing this rayne exclaimed aloud:\u201c STOP THE CARAVAN \u201d. The caravan stopped immediately. Rayne got  out and walked over to the two. Meanwhile, iosef yelled at valken: \u201cyou are retarded!  A professional army is the doctrine to follow! It allows for a better trained and  equipped army with better morale! \" immediately after iosef throws a punch at valken  but he dodged. \u201cSoldiers are mere pawns to be used and spent to follow a tactic of  attrition and trench warfare! Yours are just tactics copied from rumburg! \u201d\\* Valken  said hitting iosef straight in the nose. At that point Iosef pulled out a dagger and tried  to stab Valken when, just before touching Valken, he was stopped by Rayne. \u201cStop  your attempted murders dear compatriots! It's a presidential order! \u201dRayne said.  \"Bullshit!\" Said iosef. \"Rayne died with the bomb!\" valken said. At that point rayne  threw in the air the cape that hid the identity of him remained until then in the  shadows. \"I am ANTON RAYNE fourth president of sordland and I intend to reunite  the country and get it out of the rubble! I made many mistakes during my presidency  but now I have been sent by colonel soll in this crusade to reunite sordland and the  scar in the shape of the logo of the USP on the chest is my pledge to the world! \u201d.  Iosef and Valken immediately stopped fighting, entangled by Rayne's greatness. \"To  the president's orders\" they both said saluting. \u201cFirst let's clarify a  important detail. We need a mixed military doctrine that mixes reservism and  professionalism where every adult citizen is an army reservist but not all are  professional members. Your next order from me is to follow this caravan and take it  to holsrod where you will re-fund new holsrod and drive it temporarily in my  absence. \" rayne said. \"Mr. yes sir!\" The two exclaimed heading towards the caravan.  Rayne looked at the caravan shortly before leaving again and instead of the driver he  met the gaze of serge who burned the hope of the indominable human spirit. Serge  yelled before leaving \"A Morgna wes core\u2026 \".Rayne answered immediately after \" Vectern sis da! \".The whole caravan then cheered with screams and whistles as our  hero went towards another sunset headed for the city led by frens richter after  the apocalypse, Deyr. The journey of our hero continues ..."

Forgiving, at least to me, is more of a \"I recognise it's not you but your neuroses speaking\" kind of thing. Make the hurt impersonal, ascribe it to the system and not the person... and then still cut off the person because they're embodying what's wrong with the system. Both the cutting off *and* forgiveness are moves to cut shit out of your life, once outside, once inside. Both need to be done.",

Secondly, I suggest employing a paint/color changing system for the rims, as it could help reduce the number of rims in the store, while also allowing for more customization. Thirdly, I suggest adding a rim/tire profile adjustment system, as some of the rims are only available with a relatively small profile and vice versa. Finally, if all of this cannot be done, I would like to, at the very least, request a yellow version of the Forged Red rims to be added to the parts store.  \n\n\nThank you for your consideration."

Dice is just an analogue RNG, it's a tool without which you cannot play D&D in real life. There should be no VIRTUAL DICE ROLLS in Computer version of D&D, because:\n\n1. It's a waste of player's time - the way they did it with UI and animations of an actual DICE.\n2. It breaks immersion in the middle of dialogue - like I even forget what I'm rolling for!\n3. When it fails p1. and p2. are getting more aggravating. it was all for NOTHING\n\nI think BG1-2 did it better. I.e. NO VIRTUAL DICE. And in order to see dice rolls you had to go into settings and increase verbosity of the log.\n\nWe are all gonna save scum anyway. So don't waste our time with UI animations.\n\nI'm not saying \"remove it\" but do make it optional. No, I don't care for additional features they added on top. Scrap it all if the option is disabled.\n\nSame goes for the Rest mechanic. I hated it in every D&D game that implemented it. Not user friendly.\n\nAnd the fact that they added \"quick rest\" charges - says a lot about it. I played D&D games without it - never missed it.\n\nJust get rid of it all together, or make it a difficulty setting (Auto restore after combat on easy, rest hard on hard)"

I'm the oldest sibling out of four though we live separately from one another since my parents have been separated for over a decade now. Though I am the eldest, I feel like I don't live up to the expectations since all throughout my teen years, I have never really taken life seriously since I lived a moderately comfortable life and I have even suffered to the point where I tried to take my own life at this day a year ago. But things have gotten better, moving away from mom and her boyfriend of which I do not feel safe with has did me wonders. Though, overthinking about the future has something I've been used to for as long as I can remember but over the months I've lived here it's gotten a lot more intense. Suddenly moving away from home last March after nine years of living there and getting into a long-distance relationship has completely changed my perspective of life and how serious I want to take it. Coming to a realization that I cannot rely on both of my parents anymore as they grow more distant as time kept passing, I've come to a point where I spent a whole day looking for online jobs despite having an essay to write due tomorrow. Despite that, I still remain focused on my academics and the things where I think I excel at (mostly writing and tutoring). Then again, it's more ideal to focus on those for now no matter how much my own overthinking says otherwise. I'm happy that I have actual goals for life right now like studying abroad and finally getting to meet my boyfriend, but at the same time, it's still daunting to me on how much I've changed in a span of a year and also relieved that I've gone through possibly one of the roughest patches of my life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ndon't worry i wrote this on a chilly night after getting all of my homework done just before the dread of the future has come to possess me again"

And just recently he threatened to POISON our dog because \"all he does is break things and be useless\" no shit motherfucker it's a DOG.

I would honestly not mind at all if they actually showed real affection towards each other but no it's just indifference at best and violence at worst.\n\n It's also saddening me that my mom treats my dad (I miss him a lot) with contempt on how he lost his job and can't provide for us anymore while she just throws money at her bf like it's nothing. \n\nIt's putting me on edge because I know one or more of us in this house is going to snap at some point and it's not going to end well. So tomorrow night I'll talk to mom about moving out to my relatives in the countryside. Because she always likes to make me feel like I'm selfish and how I only think about myself. Well now since I don't like how things are here, I'll be the one adjusting for them so I won't be considered \"selfish\" anymore.\n\nI can't live here with the never ending thought that one of us will eventually snap and things will get ugly, who knows it could just be my unchecked mental instability.\n\nTldr: My mom's boyfriend is a total jerk and I can't take it anymore so I'll talk to her tomorrow night about moving out to save me from the insanity."

Secondly a lot of the support systems that were present before just aren't there anymore, many churches stopped offering support groups and switch to the mega-church style of hatred spittle with begging for donations. Before there would be someone there to talk to now they close and have no time for you unless you give them a lot of money. Even the bar scene has changed a lot of workers dealing with work stress would go to the bar with their coworkers and it acted as makeshift therapy for them, now the managers that are the problem want to come with as well as bosses making mandatory team building at these places. \n\nTLDR: Pills are cheaper then therapy, times have changed and removed a lot of support that used to be there.",

I think you have to press the dodge button and the jetpack button at the same time or something, and you have to do it just at the right time. If you do that, you can avoid getting mashed by Anakin sometimes.\n\nOtherwise, I tend to just get hit by Anakin's pull (I should practice dodging it though) and try to recover as quickly as possible to minimize the number of lightsaber hits I take when I land. My favorite way to get out when I land is to dodge in one direction, then immediately dodge in the opposite direction, and then take off and get out of Anakin's range. Then you can get back to attacking him.\n\nIf you just immediately try to take off without dodging when he's whacking you, you will probably just die before you can get out. The double dodge in opposite directions technique I use tends to confuse Anakin a bit and buy me enough time to take off without getting hit much.",

                "body": "My friend and I are starting a group to bring ranked choice voting to Charleston, and we're looking to bring in members and spread awareness.\n\nRanked Choice Voting is a system of voting aimed at weakening the duopoly of our political establishment by giving voters more choice than simply to choose the lesser of two evils.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z2fRPRkWvY) explains how in 2.5 minutes.  Click [this link](https://app.rankedvote.co/elections/3640/God-Emperor-of-the-Universe/3630/vote) to participate in an example.\n\nThis system has the following benefits:\n\n* It gets rid of the spoiler effect. When two candidates with similar views run in the general election (against a third candidate with opposing views), they don't step on each other's toes or steal each other's votes. They both know that whoever of them gets eliminated, their votes will be transferred to a candidate with similar values, so they haven't hurt their own cause by running.\n* Third party votes aren't wasted.  Voters can vote for third party candidates without feeling like they're \"wasting their vote\" because they know that even if their candidate gets eliminated, their vote will still be counted towards a more popular candidate and against the candidates that they especially don't like.\n* No need for primaries. Most cities that have implemented ranked choice voting are using it in primary and general elections alike, some cities have put an end to primary elections altogether, instead requiring all candidates to run in the general election.  This ensures that there are viable moderate candidates in the general elections rather than the extremely polarized candidates that primaries tend to produce.\n* Fewer elections in general.  Many cities that implement ranked choice voting get rid of not only the primaries, but also the runoff elections. One such city is Minneapolis, where they went from three elections (primary, general, and runoff) down to one, and reduced their administrative and financial burdens proportionally.\n\nLike this post if you're interested and please comment with your questions.  I'd love to hear from other members of the Charleston area interested in strengthening the democratic process in our city.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/m2d8xw)"

                "body": "The original 80s She-Ra got its start from the movie Secret of the Sword in which characters from an existing franchise, He-Man, embark on a journey that led to Adora being released from Shadow Weaver's control and starting her own adventure with the rebellion.  Now that She-Ra (2018) has concluded, would there be any interest in a movie that serves a similar purpose, but in reverse?  It could potentially be used to resolve a few plot holes that appear to have been left, like whatever happened to Angela, what's happening with the Horde Empire now, and how did Hordak end up on Etheria in the first place (I know he said that a portal just happened to open up on him in the middle of a battle, but that seems suspicious)?\n\nHere's my premise, I'd love to hear yours in the comments:\n\nThe best friend squad sets off on their road-trip spreading magic to the galaxy only to encounter a planet that already has some, Eternia.  It quickly comes to light that this is the home of the First Ones and that Adora herself is a long lost member of the royal family.  From there each of the girls go their separate ways to deal with family affairs.\n\nAdora wants to be polite to these strangers who call themselves her parents, but is hesitant to assume any role or title that might get her trapped in another *destiny*. She also struggles to find the words to confront them about the Heart of Etheria and all of the other planets that the Eternian Empire has drained of its magic.\n\nGlimmer finds out that the portal that Angela entered actually dropped her off right here on Eternia, which she's ecstatic about, but there's a twist.  Angela still doesn't know that Micah has actually been alive all this time and has accepted her fate being stuck on Eternia and started to move on with Man-at-Arms.  The two have evidently bonded over the shared struggle of being a single parent to a battle-hungry teenage daughter.  Glimmer struggles to figure out how to break the news to her mother without shattering the happiness she's finally found.\n\nCatra discovers that she is also from Eternia originally and had also come through the same portal that Adora had when she first arrived on Etheria and is in fact the daughter of [Chief Carnivas](https://he-man.fandom.com/wiki/Chief_Carnivus) (I know that the original Catra was a Magicat, but I'm rewriting her to be a Qadian).  She's hesitant to put her trust in them, but ultimately finds them warm and welcoming.  The girl who once said that there was nothing for her on Etheria has finally found somewhere else where she might belong.\n\nBow gets separated from Glimmer when Angela requests some one-on-one time with her daughter and winds-up in the company of the Master's of the Universe.  He struggles to break the ice at first in such a high-testosterone environment, but he manages the feat and is soon regaling them with stories from the rebellion.\n\nWhen Adora and Catra reunite, Adora has made up her mind.  She has learned her lesson from Mara's last message.  She's worth more than what she can offer to others.  These people want their daughter back, sure, but Adora has things that she wants too and this time she's going to choose her own happiness.  She's surprised however to find that Catra asks to stay a bit longer.  Thoroughly fed up with her own family, Adora asks to meet these people that have so quickly managed to melt Catra's heart and Catra agrees to introduce her.\n\nGlimmer seeks out Bow's advice and explains the entire situation with Angela to him before realizing that Bow's new friends are still in the room, all of whom are now thoroughly invested in Bow's stories and genuinely enthralled with this latest installment.\n\nMeanwhile at the Qadian village, Adora and Catra encounter a disfigured man who goes by the name Keldor {Skeletor} who tells them a tale of the King's treachery against him and his tyranny over the less powerful peoples of the planet.  Adora, having been suspicious of the Eternian Empire from the start, believes him and agrees to help him seek justice.  Catra still has her reservations.  When Keldor's true origins come to light, it's revealed that he had once tried to ingratiate himself to Horde Prime the same way that Catra had, only to end up chipped.  He had been placed under the direction of the recently demoted Hordak on Critis.  During the rebellion against the Horde there, Keldor's chipped had been damaged and using the magic of Critis and the [Havoc Staff](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/havoc-staff/4055-56584/), he had been the one to open the portal to Despondos that transported Hordak to Etheria.\n\nIn the midst of all of this, Prince Zed is making his move to assume Horde Prime's throne (I figure it's best to give a character like this a one-shot in a movie rather than letting him become another Lotor).  The best friend squad must join forces with the Master's of the Universe to prevent his rise to power."

I know that there are a lot of folks out there who are of the opinion that Catra is one of the Magicats, and I was too for a while, but I've developed another theory that I think works even better.**\n\n**I think Catra may actually be a Qadian from Eternia and the daughter of** [**Chief Carnivus**](https://he-man.fandom.com/wiki/Chief_Carnivus) **who was pulled through Light Hope's portal with Adora.  It would explain why they've always been together.  It could also be used to explain why Carnivus adopted his stance of neutrality towards other settlements.**\n\nNow imagine this for a plot line.  (This isn't part of the theory; is just me having fun with possibilities and making fanfiction.)  King Randor (Adora's father) visits Felis Qadi on a diplomatic mission to make allies.  As an act of good faith, he even brings his family (including his newborn twins) along.  Randor has been making many such alliances like this, and the hold-outs are growing ever more weary of him.  Though his intentions are peaceful, the appearance is that he is amassing power through these alliances and many hold-outs have become vocal about the need to form their own alliance to stand in opposition before Randor becomes too powerful to refuse.\n\nCarnivus is aware of the drama at play, but sees no harm in at least granting Randor an audience.  If nothing else, the act of successfully refusing him in person could do a lot to deflate the fear-mongering by showing Randor to be toothless.  While Randor and Carnivus talk shop, Randor's children are left with Carnivus' own newborn kittens in the care of the Qadian royal nanny.  When the portal opens Randor's daughter along with one of Carnivus' both go through, and no one who saw the phenomenon can offer any explanation for it.  Of course, a politically motivated kidnapping is suspected, and after fruitless searching, Carnivus resolves never to get involved in the affairs of other settlements again.  Randor's intentions may have been good, but he makes enemies, and stirs up drama; two things that Carnivus doesn't want his family and his kingdom wrapped up in if it can be at all helped.\n\nYears pass and Carnivus tries to move on for the sake of what family he still has, until Etheria emerges from Despondos and with it, a Qadian by the name of Catra who bears the same distinctive heterochromia as the child he once lost.  A long awaited reunion is now at hand.\n\nSorry if this went long.  Carnivus was a character in the 2002 He-Man series that I felt never got enough screen time, and I'd really like to see him get the opportunity to wreck Shadow Weaver's s\\*\\*\\* for what she did to Catra.  Also, if this turns out to be true, and Catra is Eternian by birth, then she supposedly meets all the requirements to wield the Sword of Protection, which could play well into u/imDONHI's Cat-Ra AU storyline."

Then Light Hope told us that only a First One could wield the sword and that's what Adora is. Now Razz has told us that She-Ra has been around since long before the First Ones arrived. \n\nIf Razz is right, then the sword being missing and Etheria having no First Ones shouldn't have been a reason for there not to be a She-Ra. Etheria could've chosen from among the locals.\n\nI think that perhaps when the First Ones overhauled the planet into a weapon they may have created the sword to act as a valve that controls the flow of magic. It's unnatural and causes the magic to continuously build up until either the weapon fires or the planet explodes. There have been She-Ra's chosen by Etheria in the past 1000 year, but even though Etheria approved of them, none met the requirements of the sword, and so they could access the magic of Etheria.\n\nThis means that when Light Hope picked Adora, she knew she couldn't just grab any random Eternian. She had to chose one that Etheria would approve of as She-Ra.\n\nWhat do you guys think?"

He said there is no time to go back home you stay until the job gets done and no overtime, forget about social life. He said we don't have any break people take their lunch at the desk and if you can't take it leave. \n\nAt night he called the reference through which I got the interview and said she is very capable, knows more then my current employes. I was testing her breaking point and that's why I yelled. Tell her to come in tomorrow.\n\nI went the next day and he called on Skype Infront of few employes and asked \"what do think about joining?\". I said I would if there is defined work time and half an hour of break. He asked to take this call in a separate room as soon as I did he started yelling at me that don't make demands Infront of my other employes. Are you stupid? Are you dumb? Don't you know that I would do this just for you.\nHe screamed alot. \nI didn't take the job, the whole day I stayed in bed I was shaken to my core.\n\nNow, there's an opening again in their company in the same dept and my brother says you should take it and that's the difference in CEO and employee mentality.

Why is better for women to stay at home? why do we have to cover up to pray to Allah, He is suppose to be closest to us so why? There are many question and ofcourse they don't have the answers to.

Were you  suffocating of everyone controlling and ordering you to pray or fast e.t.c or did you face other hardships? Or did you too had some question that couldn't be answered and decided to leave it.\n\nWhy I'd love to know all of this is because its Ramadan and I was on my way to learn more about Islam so that I won't be ignorant but it would be hypocritical for to look at one side of the coin and ignore so many people here who have a say in what Islam taught them."

Then, hint at being somewhere in the aromantic spectrum, see how they react, then decide if you want to come out. Is it safe?\n\nKeep in mind there is a lot of discrimination, I, without a doubt know that you know that, but sometimes the biggest bigots could be the people close to you. Goodluck.\n\nP.S\nIf this turns in another direction, you might get \"it's just a phase\" \"But you won't experience REAL love.\" type of bigotted stuff.\n\n\"But what if I'm friends with a lesbian?

I stopped playing the Sims 3 for a while following the release of Disney Dreamlight Valley, but recently after leaving my game open all night it's somehow forced itself into a tiny windowed mode that i couldn't move or stretch. Restarting my computer didn't fix it, so i sadly moved on to play the Sims 3 again. For some reason it wouldn't load up properly even though it was fine the last time I played, so I renamed the folder and moved some stuff around. This was my mistake. I very specifically moved my important folders instead of copying them, because my disk space is small and i didn't want to create any duplicates. Because my laptop sucks and Windows is the worst, I lost my patience while moving something that was going abnormally slow and cancelled the action. I managed to get all my folders in and started up the game, which it did normally. The game loads, shows me my installed mods...and asks me to choose a world. I realize that all my saves are gone. I check the folder and its empty. I of course googled a solution panickedly, but the only fix i found was the use of file recovery software. I began to install MiniTool, but it very explicitly stated not to use it on the same drive as my lost data. I only have one drive on my laptop, the default C: harddrive. I'm at a loss as to what to do, I need to restore my files before they're permanently removed from the disk."

Until I wanted to play Persona 3. \n\nI checked the megathread and some other links to find the ROMs and have tried both the European and American versions but the game keeps giving the same error. I even tried some different methods to solve the error (closing plugins etc.) but still no hope. \n\nThe error is 80020148 and if I'm not mistaken it's a .iso/.cso specific error. I can't update the PSP to 6.61, it is stuck at 5.50/5.51 (not sure). If anyone knows how to solve this error, I'd love to hear it.\n\nTLDR: Need help fixing 80020148 for PSP or just finding another Persona 3 ROM that'll work"

It's understandable as studio is near silent and concert has enormous background noise.\n\nAnyone who has experience with condenser mics used in a studio vs. dynamic mics used on concerts, knows that the energy level in your voice has to be somewhere else at a loud concert. They obviously do go over the full track for multiple reasons, for one they have their age alright, keeping up with that shit with no filler while moving around making a show is not easy for a young man let alone 70 year olds.\n\nBut secondly, bas' delivery voice is lower than his natural voice and it would be near impossible to perform live that way on a dynamic mic at a concert, nobody would hear him rap. If he shouted his delivery would be way different. But from that video it's obvious he knows his raps very well and their mics are plugged in.\n\nalso here are some views from behind the making of \"Plugged In\":  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvCs2r7p4y0&t=204s&ab\\_channel=PressplayMedia",

I might be mistaken.\n\nThe game had 3D graphics and I would describe it as a mix of commandos and operation flashpoint in that it had the top down view and very similar premise of controlling I think multiple soldiers, and having them ride vehicles and you could destroy whole areas and buldings, and it had this OP flashpoint-esque aesthetic or the general post-soviet era military (I think but I think it had also some more modern assets not sure)\n\nI remember being able to control a soldier (or maybe multiple even) and have them go through a training course, which I coudln't finish cause I was bad at it lol\nI remember it had to have a way of looting items and I remember it was all kinda sophisticated stuff you'd expect in a first or third person game not a top down shooter/strategy\n\nYou could shoot on targets, ride vehicles, destroy buildings etc. again everything (to me) had this post-soviet look and I remember I played with the level editor a lot. I specifically remember spawning cooling towers from a nuclear power plant and then destroying them by a tank or something. I remember how it fell apart it was very good for the time.\n\nI have no idea what this game is called it might have been czech or slovak or even russian game I remember I had it from a gaming magazine or perhaps a gaming website or maybe it was a demo I'm not sure. \n\nI also remember that it had a bit of an unusual name I think\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who might know!

Nobody could understand what it meant unless you were like sasuke, like iruka, like naruto - an orphan. \n\nEven Sakura, clearly well behaved, empathetic person was hard-pressed by her own bubble, to realize how much Sasuke and Naruto have in common despite being so different.\n\nShe came from a different world, naive, blind to the harsh realities of kids who had to take it upon themselves to fight their demons (quite literally lol). Naruto in a positive way, by becoming a Hokage and Sasuke in a negative way, pursuing vengeance.\n\nIn any case, this also highlights Sakura's trials of a kid from a good and succesful, cohesive family. What could go wrong in that case? Well she's naive, and her silver spoon life doesn't provide such a drive that Naruto and Sasuke have.  \n\nSakura as a privileged kid, is fighting the comfort zone her whole life. She is constantly fighting lack of deep motivation, which is why she needs to amp herself up, feelings of inadequacy, lack of awareness, lack of sense of self, which, from time to time, comes up in her head when she's angry. \n\nEven shy and unconfident Hinata had a hard time growing up compared to Sakura. Sakura's biggest problem were her rival Ino, her crush Sasuke and Naruto being annoying. She became a legendary Sannin despite having any demon or heritage like Naruto and Sasuke. She's a mad hard worker just like Rock Lee.\n\nHer lack of problems and constant will to equal their peers despite her missing the incentive to do so, is what gives Sakura and her blooming throughout the series the depth you all keep saying she doesn't have.\n\nHopefully now you know why she's such an integral part of the series. In fact, she's the one character most people can really connect with. \n\nMost kids of the western world aren't orphans. Most kids grow up with normal families have normal lives, no special talent a lot of self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy, naive, concerning ourselves with surface-level stuff. Sakura is an excellent character."

I attempted it yesterday with a black band (better than before). While I can curl when I\u2019m not locked out, the moment I lock out, I am unable to curl my biceps. In my one attempt (of me pulling as hard as I can) I ended up pulling myself up with straight arms, much like a van gelder. My scapula was fairly retracted and elevated during the pull, which is a problem, even though I managed to pull myself up to a foot supported maltese.\n\nIt\u2019s apparent to me that my protraction and depression isn\u2019t strong/active enough to keep the joint stable for curling. How do I go about isolating this movement when I can\u2019t even move from retracted to protracted (I can pull from retracted sup BL to neutral, but anymore and I end up pressing up to hang rather than protracting).\n\nAlso, I can sort of pelican without band, but the moment I lock out, I can\u2019t move. (Have tried on bars a few months ago, it felt a lot easier because of stability).\n\nI can planche on rings for 3-4 seconds.\n\nThe only method I can think of, since bands aren\u2019t working, is to have someone spot me, but that is not an option as it happens at most three times a month.\n\nTldr: how do I train my protraction while in shoulder extension? I\u2019m assuming mobility has something to do with it as my recording shows me externally rotating before I can pull."

Not sure if I should flex my neck like that though. Also, should I aim to go behind the body or is it because this guy has hyperextension that he can reach that far?\n\nI assumed the form is to maintain depression with neutral scapula at the bottom.\n\nHere\u2019s my current form (as I\u2019ve experimented today): https://youtu.be/9lj7vLfDS2A\n\nI raise my arms at the bottom to push up which I assume is because I\u2019m not strong enough. It feels like my scapula is in the same position and not elevating when I do this. I can\u2019t bring my rings any lower, so would progressions be to progressively lean into a maltese? Imo it seems quite effective since I can false grip at the bottom which is pretty similar to IC.\n\nAdditionally, as I\u2019ve been training pelicans prior to my deload (last week), should I continue them or remove them if I were to add these chest flies or do I lower intensity for the added volume of both to condition the tendons and ligaments.\n\nI\u2019m lumping it in with my pull sessions since it doesn\u2019t seem that push intensive after I\u2019ve tried it (minuscule fatigue in pecs), and also because I train pelicans on my push sessions, adding them at the bottom of pppu as you recommended in an older post."

I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because I was messing around with Rto Dip negative into a BL (essentially the descent of a pullup to BL) on top of performing Rto Dips 2 sessions a week.\n\nTwo blocks ago, I could crank out 2-3 reps of mediocre form: chest arching on the way up.\n\nMy current progress is recorded in this video (last two reps were what I considered \u201cmediocre form.\u201d): https://youtu.be/Sjxzq2fBK5Q\n\nThat is a rep off my max (assuming total form failure). \n\nMy first question is if I should terminate the set once I can no longer dip with good form (and increase sets) or to continue regardless. Why I think this is because RTO Dips are still a heavily strength-based element for me, but I\u2019m conflicted since I wouldn\u2019t consider it a ORM when I train 3 reps at a time.\n\nMy second question has to do with my grip. The root of palms are on the rings which (I think) makes it easier to dip due to less wrist engagement. Please correct my logic if I\u2019m wrong; should I grip this way?\n\n\nEdit: due to the angle of the video, it looks like my Rto falters on the way up. I took a video from the front and it appears that at the initiation of the dip upwards, my Rto is > 90\u00b0 hence the return. I\u2019m assuming this has something to do with my grip."

It was an internet video, so it could have been fake. Either way, I\u2019m contemplating over learning this mythical skill once I get my planche on rings mastered (probably in a year or two). I can impossible dip with shoulder in line with elbow (not behind elbow yet; I\u2019m working on it). I\u2019m assuming the lean required will be phenomenal due to shortening the lever arm from shoulder distance to elbows. My question is: in such a position where I would need to actively press my hands down to resist face-planting (which will be taxing on the elbows), is it possible for the elbow to bare such force or would it be stupid to train with or without prehab. Essentially, how anatomically possible is this skill for someone like me at 5\u20194\u201d\u2014or is this just a shortcut to screwing up my elbows.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m aware my body would be planching at a slight diagonal incline since there\u2019s no feasible way for the elbow to reach under my body\u2019s center of gravity if my body was parallel to the ground even with extreme lean.\n\nOn how I\u2019d start training, it\u2019d be with a stupidly heavy resistance band strapped above where my elbow is (lower part of belly rather than hips) as well as performing planche leans in a bentarm plank position with an elevated lower body. It\u2019s a fantasy that I\u2019d be able to get into such a position and tricep extension myself out into a planche."

[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/3iydY8P) the pics of me trying on the two that fit best. Natori Flora in 32G and Panache Envy in 32FF.\n\nThe calculator estimated my size at UK 32FF, 32G, or 34F.\n\nMy measurements when I ordered:\n\nLoose: 33.5/85\n\nSnug: 30.5/77.5\n\nTight: 28.5/72.5\n\nStanding: 39.5/100.5\n\nLeaning: 41/104\n\nLaying: 38.5/97.75\n\nI  remeasured today after trying on the bras I ordered to make sure my measurements didn\u2019t change wildly or something. The calculator gave me 32FF which does seem closer.\n\nLoose: 33.25/84.5\n\nSnug: 31/78.75\n\nTight: 29/73.5\n\nStanding: 39.5/100.5\n\nLeaning: 40.75/103.5\n\nLaying: 38.5/97.75\n\nI had to wear both bras on the tightest hooks. The wire sat a bit below my IMF in both bras as well. There was some gapping at the top of the cups and I feel like I really didn\u2019t fill out the cups in the panache envy at all. The panache envy\u2019s wires felt like they went almost to my back. The panache envy also looked very pointy to me which I really don't like. I know I have immediate projection, Idk how projected I am otherwise but I don't like how projected bras are so pointy which is why I like how the natori flora looks.\n\nThe natori flora actually seemed to fit better but as I mentioned I had to wear it on the tightest hook and the wire didn't sit in the IMF. It still gapped at the top a bit but less than the envy. The underwires still come back past my breast tissue but not as much as the envy. The flora is overall much more comfortable than the envy but it does feel lower quality.\n\nOne of the reasons the calculator might be overestimating my size is because I was a swimmer and I still swim as I work at a pool so I do have somewhat bigger shoulder and upper back muscles. I also have a bit of space between my breasts which could contribute as well. It overestimated my band size as well cause I had to put the 32 bands on the tightest hooks and Idk why that is.\n\nSo what's next? I'm still confused about shape. I think I might have issues cause my back is wider from swimming so while I look wider set from the front I'm not wide set in relation to my band measurement. Maybe I'd do better with a smaller band and a band extender? The straps also felt too wide on me like they were digging into my armpits."

I can\u2019t remember the other bras I liked but I know I lived in Aerie bras when I was still able to fit them. Can your shape change when you gain or lose weight? I feel like I\u2019m much more projected than I used to be.\n\nI also really don\u2019t like how projected bras look so pointy. Is there a bra that can support me and be comfortable while looking less pointy even though I\u2019m projected?

                "body": "As a manager who has had to deal with a variety of workplace issues over my career, some of which had to be taken to HR, here is what I recommend:\n\n1. Document everything. Write down all these incidents in a log and start tracking them. Add dates, times, screenshots of calls, voicemail transcripts, thing you/he said, etc. Keep as much to the facts as possible, so don\u2019t add things like you think he was trying to sound seductive unless you have a fact to back it up. You want to sound as unbiased as possible in your report.\n\n2. At some point you do need to tell him directly that you don\u2019t like him asking about your personal life, and that you want after work hour calls to be strictly about work/emergencies. You don\u2019t have to be rude, but you can frame it as \u201chey, the handbook says I\u2019m only supposed to take after hours calls if they are an emergency. If this isn\u2019t an emergency, let\u2019s talk during work hours.\u201d Then hang up. If he tries to talk about other things like your personal life, you need to tell him this call is not about your personal life, and if he doesn\u2019t have anything work related you are going to hang up. As with before, document this.\n\nIt\u2019s critical to document your efforts to curb this behavior because it gives HR a stronger case later on if he persists. He won\u2019t be able to say he didn\u2019t know or you didn\u2019t tell him.\n\n3. I can\u2019t say don\u2019t pick up the phone because if you don\u2019t, it may be used as an excuse to show you don\u2019t answer/make yourself available during work emergencies. So tackling this more head on by answering/shutting down the call may be more effective in the long run for you.\n\n4. If he doesn\u2019t dial it back after you expressly tell him,  document new incidents and then take it to HR.\n\nThis is critical because it starts a paper trail. Or adds to an existing paper trail if he already has other complaints filed against him you don\u2019t know about (and from my experience this is rarely the first time people have tried this).\n\nThis also provides insurance against retaliation. I can\u2019t say that always works, but it gives you a very strong legal case if you submit a report, HR ignores it, and you are fired in a retaliatory manner.\n\nThere are legal resources online you can also go to, will try to find them and link them.\n\n5. Keep copies of everything you document on a personal device so you have it as backup. \n\nIn summary: sorry you have to go through this. This sucks, and I\u2019ve been there. Try to see this as a chance to get good at speaking up for yourself, setting boundaries, and making the most of HR to create a professional environment you feel comfortable in. There\u2019s going to be a learning curve but I absolutely promise that if you can navigate this you will be so much more empowered and capable in any future role you hold in your career. Knowing how to deal with these kinds of issues and take control of them is key to having a happy work life.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any questions. Wishing you the best in this.",

But I was never treated better/worse by my dates at any weight. \n\n2. The biggest change in how men treated me came from dying my hair blonde. Had more doors held open for me and fewer accidental shoulder checks in a crowd.\n\n3. No change at work, but I have an assertive personality. I shut down unprofessional behavior very fast. \n\n4. No change from family or friends, although I had some friends tell me they thought I was beautiful at a 32 BMI and didn\u2019t need to lose weight (they were trying to be supportive and nice, but I am glad I didn\u2019t listen to them).\n\n5. No major change from strangers, although I\u2019ve found I\u2019m more willing to ask strangers to bend the rules for me (such as letting me go back inside to get something after I\u2019ve been locked out). But I can\u2019t say they wouldn\u2019t have done that for me before\u2014I just didn\u2019t try as much.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nLosing weight made a million changes inside me. I care a lot more about my appearance now in a good way. I pay more attention to my skin, hair, teeth, etc. \n\nI think more about fashion and how I can use it to express how I view myself. I feel more comfortable trying things on that might look bad on me \u201cjust to see\u201d if it might look okay.\n\nI am more comfortable getting hand-me-downs from my friends.\n\nI am more confident overall and feel more in control of my life, my health, and my future. It finally feels like the me in my head and the me in my body are lining up.\n\nI am more excited to see what physical goals I can accomplish with my body (I can do PULL UPS NOW!!!). \n\nOh, and I can finally feel confident attracting the kind of men I find attractive. \n\nSo yeah\u2026wouldn\u2019t change my weight loss for the world. Even my most bloated, blegh, bad days still feel so much better. I am so much closer to being the person I want to be, and I love that.\n\nOn a side note, two things I did expect that didn\u2019t happen:\n\n1. I would get hit on more by men my age (early 30s). NOPE. I still only get hit on by men 25+ years my senior lol.\n\n2. I would look super toned when I lost weight. Also nope\u2026I looked like a smaller version of my heavy self. Weight training and changing my diet is what started to actually lean my body out and give me a more toned look.",

I mean granted, if I could do it all over again I\u2019d love to have maybe 1/10th of what I had for my housemate because that initial crush was intense and made it very hard to stay focused in day-to-day life, but it would be nice to have some of that feeling. I could skip the feeling entirely if I knew a relationship would end in that same deep-rooted fondness.\n\nIt just feels so scary to meet and date guys and just feel nothing. It\u2019s like throwing pennies into a dark well and never hearing them hit the bottom. I don\u2019t know how much time/attention/energy I have to invest before I will register an emotional response in myself. \n\nAlso FWIW, I am not hung up on my housemate anymore. I asked him out on a date six months after I had moved out (we had remained good friends thereafter), and he ghosted me. It was the kind of response I needed to move on. I do not compare men I date to him except in whether I can have similar kinds of feelings as I once did. \n\nTo address your other point though\u2014I think telling guys I move slow overall may be a good thing to do. I\u2019ve started telling that to guys recently but it seems like they interpret that as meaning 1-2 more dates kind-of slowly, which is\u2026yeah, not really what I mean. I should probably be more clear. \n\nAnd yes on the sex! I am glad you get it! I have found that to be my experience, that men see a willingness to have sex as a sign I am definitely emotionally invested and very into them.\n\nQuestion, but would you say it\u2019s better to hold off on sex until I do have more of an emotional attachment? I wonder if they\u2019re seeing \u201ci move slow emotionally\u201d + willingness to have sex as a sign of mixed signals.",

The reasoning goes like this: \u201cthey want to see/talk to me, do Y together, etc. None of these are bad/harmful things. I don\u2019t have any strong reason to say no because I don\u2019t have any real feelings about it\u2026so what\u2019s the harm in saying yes? Maybe it\u2019s an opportunity to develop an emotional connection.\u201d\n\nThen I would do these things, their emotional investment/attraction would increase, and I\u2019d be left going \u201cwhy don\u2019t I feel any more romantic/interested in them than I did before?\u201d Which has led me to ultimately feel like I am doing something wrong for not having a growing (or even budding) sense of attraction. And then as they want more I end up feeling smothered by it (both by their desire for more of my time/energy as well as my own sense of guilt for not feeling more). Somehow these bonding moments impact their emotional state but not mine. \n\nI have no issues with boundaries in a lot of other areas of dating\u2014just hard to have boundaries when I have no real reasons to back them up in my mind. It feels like saying no to open doors for no good reason. \n\nAnd you aren\u2019t being patronizing at all\u2014it\u2019s good advice! If I say no I always reschedule. I try to be very courteous and show interest regularly\u2014I just wish I felt it emotionally! \n\nAll this said, I think you\u2019ve helped me realize something\u2014letting others set the pace really only sets me up to feel extra emotionally disconnected and then ultimately guilty for not feeling more, and that doesn\u2019t make me feel good or put a good spin on the relationship. A lack of strong feelings shouldn\u2019t always be an automatic yes to whatever they propose. \n\nI\u2019m not quite sure how to act on that info but I\u2019m going to try and roll it into a plan of action going forward. I would love to feel okay about the pace I move at, even if it\u2019s not for everyone. \n\nI really appreciate you taking the time to talk to me about this!

Short of it is I wasn\u2019t interested in dating through most of my twenties. Had some crushes in late twenties/early thirties but none were ever returned (was not their preferred ethnicity).\n\nSince then I\u2019ve done a lot of short-term dating (1-2 months) and a couple FWBs. Most ended due to major incompatibilities.\n\nBut here\u2019s my real issue: none of the guys I dated for 1-2 months I was emotionally into. They were nice guys, good people, etc. Had a nice time with them and no problem being physical. Just felt nothing emotionally that would qualify as \u201cromantic.\u201d Didn\u2019t long for them, miss them, check my phone extra often to see if they replied to a text, etc. No butterflies or anticipation or excitement.\n\nWhen the relationships ended I felt similarly unmoved. \n\nA couple questions:\n\n1. If you have experienced this, what\u2019s the way to work around it? I\u2019m not sure if I just haven\u2019t met the right person or if I should just continue to date people and see if I eventually am into them.\n\n2. If I were to continue dating someone without feelings, what\u2019s a reasonable timeline to date and see if they grow? I don\u2019t want to lead anyone on but also am wondering if I just need more time with someone to like them.\n\n3. Is this struggle something I should share with people I\u2019m dating? I am always torn if I should tell men how unsure I am, or if I should just work on it privately on my own.\n\nAny anecdotes or additional advice for people who have had this issue is much appreciated.\n\nI am trying to find a way to more easily tap into my feelings (or at least draw them out). But with limited experience I\u2019m not sure the best strategy.\n\nOn an aside, I am not a cold or reserved person, I am very emotionally expressive, warm, and open. I also come across that way when dating.\n\nAppreciate your feedback!"

It's just that he was always up early at some point in time because he was hooking up with his AP at 3-4am so he was always dead tired earlier on than usual. It just made me chuckle inside. See, I never told anyone on my side of the family about WH's infidelity so unintentional triggers like this happen a lot. His side just knows cause they were the ones that caught him without telling me btw.

He was paralyzed from the waist down. \n\nSo after a few years, my dad was dying soon. I had a talk with him about how he wanted things to be as we were living in a home that wasn't legally ours. The land is named under his brother, let's call him Bob. I lived in this house ever since I was born. My dad had a couple of plots of land that were under his name. One of his brothers is living in one and Bob has a sort of business in another. My dad said that he only desired the house where I grew up in. He was willing to give away all other plots of land under his name to his siblings in exchange for our home. It's also his way of saying thank you to his siblings. I told dad it'd be nice if he could settle this with his siblings while he was still alive cause his siblings can be difficult. He was denied immediate action by Bob. His excuse was that there were no funds to initiate the exchange. \n\nSo Bob just verbally promised dad that he'd keep to his word and not worry about it. Asked my dad about what to do if Bob and his siblings didn't keep their end of the bargain. My dad told me that I should keep everything that's under his name should they disrespect his dying wish. \n\nSo dad passed, we of course needed to do the paperwork. We approached Bob about the home and he was very hostile about it. Asking us why we were in such a rush. To be honest, mom and I just wanted peace and not have to think of the taxes and possibly getting evicted. We just wanted our home to be ours. \n\nWe approached dad's siblings. Hired a lawyer to create a legal agreement which was rejected. We tried to offer dad's lands over and over in exchange just so we can safely own the house we lived in. We found out later on that Bob pawned off the deed of the house we live in without telling my dad. He did this while dad was still alive. Which explains why he can't do the exchange.\n\nIt's been 5 years since my dad died and we are still in a stalemate. Bob has verbally abused my mom and I for far too long.\n\nI decided that I am fed up with them and am letting go of the house and just take everything that dad left me. My mom thinks we should still give my dad's siblings a bit of inheritance as she feels bad about it. I told her that I am just fulfilling what dad told me to do before he passed. Not to mention how pissed off I already am. \n\nTLDR: Dad passed. We don't own our house, his sibling does. Dad has a few lands under his name that's worth a modest amount and is willing to let it go in exchange for the house I grew up in. Sibling pawned off house behind dad's back.\n\nWIBTA for deciding to keep the inheritance all to myself?"

Instead, they want me to be benevolent towards my AF because he \"loves\" me in his own way. Their justification is that my AF paid a small part of my tuition fees (I had a scholarship). My AF is the typical authoritarian kind of parent. Below are some examples. \n\n1. Shouted at me for exercising. Because according to him, no one wants a lady with muscles. Shouted at me and called me stupid when I told him that I did not care.\n2. Criticized my reaction when I got momentarily angry when my AM accidentally poured food over me. AF gaslighted me by saying that I should never get angry over small matters. Meaning I can't have negative emotions towards them. I didn't shout at my AM or anything, I just gave her the side eye. (the reason for my reaction is because my AM is very smart in pretending to be nice to me in front of others, but she treats me indifferently when no one is around). \n3. AF threatened to kick me out of the house if I refused to give my room up when my grandma comes to visit. I would've readily volunteered my room if he asked nicer. But no, he demanded it. All I can do is comply.\n\nI would love to move out and go no contact with my AP but my current financial situation doesn't permit such a move. \n\nWhat I don't understand is why my Asian family and relatives normalized such behaviors. They said that my AF is less educated thus the way he speaks. I told them that the issue with my AF behaviors has already been brought up to him by me previously (I have told my AM about hers as well). If my AP wants to change, they can. But they refused, saying that no one can really change themselves. Then I straight up told my relatives and AM (she was present) that I will go no contact when I move out for the peace of my mind. My relatives were flabbergasted and said nothing. They might be thinking that I am cruel or something but there ain't going to be filial piety if I am being treated like sh\\*t."

My mom is obvious in showing who is her favorite. She coddles all of my other siblings (especially my eldest brother), ie takes care of their meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner), does laundry and ironing for them, washes their dishes after eating, etc. Mind you, they are all over 25y.o. (oldest is 35). Oh and of course when I asked her out sometimes, she will always reject my invitation but will agree to go with my brothers if they invite her to do the same thing.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other hand, my dad has been screaming at me since young to do all the housework because I am a girl (which I retaliated against such an outdated and sexist gender role). My mom has often shown and expressed annoyance whenever I did what my brothers do on housework (she never does that to any of my brothers because I was always at home when she helps them out). So, to avoid that, I cook all my meals myself, do my own laundry and ironing, wash all my dishes, etc. But it makes her even more anal about things I forgot sometimes (like leaving things around for a little while. Mind you, I only have a pair of hands and legs and I can only do so much at once). I think this is why I have avoidant attachment issues.\n\nI often called my parents out, especially my mother for her obvious biases, and she of course denies it. She always sounds hostile while speaking to me even when I was just trying to make some conversation ( ie her famous \"don't know\" while giving me an impatient look for talking to her). Obviously, I was always hurt by her responses to my attempts to interact with her. This has been going on for many years now, and it's especially worse when I moved back in 2 years ago when covid first started (also because I am more vocal about their BS now).\n\nps. I don't talk to my dad anymore after he tries to command me, authoritatively, on how to act. He shamed me for doing weight training and gaslighted me whenever I get angry with their words and the way they spoke to me. I have had enough so I never look at or talk to him.\n\nSometimes I wonder why my brothers grew up to be such confident and chill people, and why I am the opposite of that. Now I kinda get why.\n\nThe question is, what are my parents trying to do to me? Should I try to address these issues again with them? (Previously when I did, mom gaslighted me saying that I made these up, and dad went completely silent like somehow he knows he is in the wrong)."

Not defending piracy, but I believe there are other factors as well contributing to this issue. \n\nFirstly, obvious one, is language barrier when it comes to reading a work in foreign language. Secondly, accessibility to their work, like the pricing etc. Next is the company that\u2019s paying them, who hold most of the leverage on how much they should get paid for their work. \n\nLet\u2019s assume that all the piracy sites disappeared one day. Those three issues remain and the authors are still going to continue to suffer. They won\u2019t get enough recognition (internationally), their audience group will remain small (catered only to those knowing the language and middle-class and above who can afford it), and still they will be underpaid by those unscrupulous companies (capitalism, low wage, high profits for CEOs). Get what I am saying?\n\nThis whole feud is probably fed by those obnoxious, thinking-they-are-all-mighty, you-versus-them, and the \u2018I don\u2019t want to pay you more so I will scapegoat someone else for you to blame and hate on\u2019 entities. \n\nThis is a very common occurrence, it\u2019s nothing new at all. Employers pitting employees against each other, in the name of competition, to prevent employees uprising  against employers for not paying them well. Politicians pitting citizens against foreign migrants, blaming them for taking their jobs, instead of calling politicians out for their incompetency. Companies underpaying their authors, blaming everything on piracy, while they sit on their private planes, sipping champagne. \n\nSo what I am saying here is that they should really look into other problems as well. The first two issues are probably why piracy is a thing (language, accessibility). Also, about them not getting paid enough, they should bring it up to their employers instead. It is a systemic problem, really. \n\nAgain, not defending piracy here. I respect the authors and their wonderful creations. I enjoyed their work very much and would love to support them. But I cannot deny that those translations (without permission) of their work is what got me into liking them in the first place. I don\u2019t know why fans like me get shamed all the time on Twitter. If you\u2019re able to give us a translation version of your work and with affordable pricing, we are all ready to support and love your work."

When I went hypo, I became super withdrawn and slightly paranoid. I didn't give an f about people and had no desire to associate with anyone. I'm sure it varies for everyone, of course, and it depends on your social circle. Graves always made me more impatient with my parent but my tolerance for others stayed constant.

My sis was way ahead of me the whole time and started to get kind of cocky about it. That really got to me and I was so triggered(?) by how she could be \"better\" than me. The whole time I cursed under my breath and gave death stares to nothing in particular but the air in front of me. I was so angry but also trapped in the \"spiral of darkness\" again. Threatened to >!kill my sister!< (good thing she wasn't paying attention to me) and just was plain old grumpy the whole time. These behaviors are not what anyone, even myself would expect of me. I returned home with a headache and probably isolated myself to get out of the mood. So strange when I think about it now. I have no idea what kind of thing in the past could have programmed this \"want to destroy things or even be a psychopath\" kind of mindset switch in me.

But I have been getting so many physical anxiety symptoms (not the norm for me even though I experience anxiety) and I've never felt this type of numbness before. I think gray rocking is affecting me very badly. \n\nI was incredibly fatigued today and numb. I've been dissociating here and there and restless, playing music, painting my feelings, using my phone, reading books, singing, talking to my other family members, and scrolling my phone--but I felt like a mess through all of it\n\nMy mom tried to give me a hug today- she walked in my room, told me \"we don't have to talk--\" and touched my shoulders in a desperate attempt to hug me which I didn't receive well. Then she phone calls a friend (for support I think?). I feel so bad- I desperately want to connect with my mom. The feeling's like knowing you need sleep but depriving yourself of it. Or having an itch and not scratching it. I don't like feeling this tension and conflict \n\nI feel so bad that I'm shutting my mom out and I'm only two days in so I'm worried! (I don't even know for sure if she is really at fault). I don't know how long I can do this. I read somewhere that you can gray rock while still being polite--just not bringing up anything personal or meaningful when you interact with the person you are gray rocking. Does anyone have any tips on how to gray rock this way and do it so that it doesn't wreck you emotionally? Especially when you have to live with your person for years more?"

But I'm two weeks in my therapy sessions and we've been discussing _why_ I feel the way I do. Turns out it may have a lot to do with my relationship with my mom. I may have been a scapegoat for the longest time and I never accepted it. Oh the irony of how I started therapy to get a mood disorder diagnosis but I have uncovered a whole new thing instead. :( I'm just really doing a lot of research on it (it's not the first time I've read up on it but I'm taking it more intentionally now). I may not know what's going on right now and who my mom really is. But I'm going to keep trying to stay afloat.\n\nI still live with my family and just finished my first college semester at home. Cutting things off is no option for me. My mom is not toxic 100% of the time which often leaves me confused and feeling like I'm dramatizing things. I have chosen not to speak to her in a personal manner or share accomplishments and happy things anymore. But unfortunately I'm a really sensitive person (and I value my family) so I don't feel good about this. This is just really hard."

It's been difficult and I downplay my negative moments all the time, but I'm giving this a go again and taking the first step. I really want to get better. Especially because my family has had to deal with my moodiness all the time. \n\nI have suspected so many things to be the cause of my unusualness- autism spectrum, adhd, bpd, attachment issues, bipolar, being a hsp, or just my personality type\ud83d\udc40 I may have ocd but I still feel like my \"issues\" can't be just anxiety. I found this sub a few minutes ago and I've been reading the posts--there are so many things I can relate to. I even can say I feel seen. I do not know if I have bipolar 2, but I've just been thinking about it a lot lately. I'm so grateful to have reddit and read about everyday experiences from genuine human beings- it's been such a comfort during this time. \n\nSidenote: I was considering sharing on here (not for diagnosis purposes!) a list of \"symptoms\" from childhood to the present that I plan to share with a therapist one day. It's a brief compilation of behavior I've noticed, including things that have always stood out as \"weird\" to me. I've always been moody, like many young adults out there, but my intense angry and down moments are what concern me. Would anyone appreciate reading something like that (maybe you may relate to me!) or would it be considered spammy?"

It's why we have a market for dubious gas station er...supplements, diets, exercise programs, cosmetic procedures, spa services, and more. People, whether cis or trans, generally like to feel affirmed in their identified gender whether it aligns with what they were assumed at birth or not.\n\nHeck, I used to think that my dysphoria was in the opposite direction: that I wasn't feminine enough to see myself as a woman. I tried that several times always rehashing my style until I realized that I was actually trans. \n\nThe transphobia comes in when a cis person knows that transitioning would make them dysphoric and project those anxieties onto trans people, usually of their AGAB. It comes out when that cis person realizes that not everyone has the same goals and desires for their body as they do and that, even if they are non-normative, that doesn't give them the right to impose their ideals on others.\n\nGranted, this does not account for all transphobia, especially when taking the racist homophobic, and misogynistic roots of transphobia into account, but I think it does cover some of it."

You can also browse socials to try to find groups (just from looking at their Insta I\u2019ve stumbled across Victoria Forest Alliance and Disrupt Land Forces)\n\nThe other big thing would be trying to attend know your rights trainings if they\u2019re available in your area, and folks there can usually direct you to groups/campaigns that may be relevant to what you care about. \n\nThat\u2019s about as much as I can think of, sorry that it\u2019s pretty unhelpful but good luck, I hope you find a group/campaign you resonate with!",

They specifically referred to me as \u201cthe female\u201d and never anything else (I\u2019m transmasc and also. I have a name) and left me in a cell until I started seeing things and thought the floor was moving. I was, thankfully, not strip searched but the pat downs feel so invasive and those who were strip searched were visibly distressed after. They also had a habit of releasing us at 2am without any technology and with some trains not running, if we didn\u2019t have activists waiting for us, we\u2019d be left there unable to get home. Bastards. \n\nIm still very much shaken by it, and am so so angry at how unjust and disgusting the policing and legal system is. I had to take a step back from that level of activism as I just can\u2019t deal with it. \n\nI try to cope how I can. I\u2019ve painted political slogans all over the police papers, my favourite being \u201cnot gay as in happy but queer as in fuck the police\u201d. I also recently found some lovely (/s) copaganda about lgbt cops in a newspaper I got that I cannot wait to deface and paint over. I\u2019ve learnt pro-union songs. Whenever cop cars pass me, I whisper \u201cfuck you\u201d or \u201cACAB\u201d under by breath. And of course, just want ever vents anger \u2014 smashing plates, screaming, etc. it can also be good to go to \u201clegal\u201d marches and just scream, or take part in lower scale activism, though both those still carry risks. And keep in touch with fellow activists in your community who may have gone through similar experiences. \n\nUnfortunately, when the whole system is fucked and the people meant to help (like therapists) are clearly unsupportive (in my experience) it can be so difficult to deal with the frustration, anger and humiliation, but trying to dissipate it in small ways is the best we can do. \n\nGood luck, and my dms are open if you want to talk or vent about this further.

Looking it up, this is what is said: \u201cNo person arrested for a traffic, regulatory or misdemeanor offense, except in cases involving weapons or a controlled substance, shall be strip searched unless there is a reasonable belief that the individual is concealing a weapon or controlled substance.\u201d So in theory you shouldn\u2019t be strip searched unless weapons are involved. But we know the police are shit so I would recommend that you do not disclose that you are trans, unless they do take you for strip search. Then it may be that you declare your packer and also what gender officer you would like to search you. It is up for them to decide from there. \n\nI have only been arrested in the uk, so cannot comment in detail. \n\nFor a police cell \u2014 you\u2019re on your own, so it\u2019s neutral. If it\u2019s on your legal documents, they should treat you entirely as male. Unless your packer contains metal, it\u2019s fine. It will also just depend on how much of an asshole they are (they\u2019re all assholes but some more than others). You shouldn\u2019t be in a police cell for long. \n\nPrison is a different matter. Since this will occur after trial, you will likely have a lawyer if you can afford one, and they are the best person to ask. Here prison is on a case-by-case basis but I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s like over the pond \u2014 but your lawyer will be the best person to ask. \n\nAlso I assume you know this but doesn\u2019t harm to reiterate: don\u2019t come out to them if they assume your gender correctly, don\u2019t give them any detail other than what you are legally required to give, ask them to read your rights, you are not legally obliged to sign any documents and would recommend not doing so, don\u2019t engage in conversation even if it seems unrelated to your case. \n\ntldr: will depend on police station but for an arrest not much of the process is gendered, they should treat you as your gender and the holding cells will be single anyway. Also please please know your rights!",

Congrats on your offer xx\n\nHate to be this imprecise but the workload is what you make of it, especially for English, since it\u2019s mainly up to you how much reading you\u2019ll put into it. It is obviously a step up from a level (you\u2019ll be doing roughly an essay a week, each week on different texts) but I found it manageable, with a decent chunk of free time. Contact hours are low, usually around 2 hours a week for supervisions, and lectures will be in person (online only if you have disability needs) but are not compulsory, and it\u2019s up to you how much work you wish to put into your essay. You don\u2019t need to overwork yourself to get a good essay. If possible read some of the longer texts (or an introduction text, especially for medieval lit) at before terms but please put relaxing and having fun first!! \n\nYou\u2019ll be given a Director of Studies (DoS) who is a great shout if you\u2019re struggling academically. You\u2019ll also have supervisors for each paper, who you can ask for help from, and if you\u2019d rather talk to students, you\u2019ll be given college parents\u2014at least one of them should be doing your subject\u2014and they can help you out, or help you get further help. \n\nShould be fine to continue making and selling earrings (that\u2019s really neat btw!) if it\u2019s three hours a week. I definitely spent 3 or more hours painting or doing other crafts, and workloads was still manageable, and it\u2019s really nice to be calm and creative for a bit. \n\nWill say this is mainly from my own experience of first year, everyone\u2019s will be different.

                "body": "This is mainly a vent, so I apologise in advance (also apologies if formatting goes wrong, mobiles are annoying)! \n\nFor a bit of context, I\u2019m studying in a Catholic sixth form (senior year for some countries) in the uk\u2014which is luckily more progressive than other schools in the area, but of course, is really far from perfect. \n\nPart of our philosophy and religion course has a unit on atheism. I\u2019m pretty sure she thinks we\u2019re all religious, and so she didn\u2019t entirely hold back from her views on atheists. I try to respect her, but it was quite overwhelming. \n\nShe essentially portrayed atheists as freaks indoctrinated by post-modernist ideology, with no real backing. She also said a \u2018good\u2019 atheist had to be well versed in major religions, if they\u2019re going to reject them, and that most atheists are uneducated regarding religion, so most atheists are bad atheists. That being said, she\u2019s never expected Christians to read other religious texts, so...love that bit of hypocrisy. \n\nFurthermore, she argued that atheists, being a product of post-modernism, also hold the post-modernist view of anti-reality and anti-truth. Therefore, atheists apparently prevent Christians from spreading the \u2018truth\u2019 (not \u2018their\u2019 truth, she explicitly said it was \u2018the\u2019 truth), and thus Christians are now oppressed, and atheism is the norm now. \n\nAnd of all things she used to prove Christians are oppressed? The anti-discriminatory laws. It was pretty much \u201cChristians now have to deny their faith, and do things like open their businesses up to gay people. It\u2019s hypocritical as gay people get to live out their lives, but Christians are denied their rights to express their faith.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s mainly annoying as I don\u2019t know how much my class bought into it. My teacher has shown us PragerU videos before, with absolutely no criticism of the content, which people accepted easily despite it being incredibly misleading. It seems similar here. The only atheist arguments she has presented are Freud and Jung\u2019s, but I\u2019m pretty sure many atheists don\u2019t think religion is a result of the Oedipus complex or archetypes, and have other arguments but...yeah, not the best defence. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t help when you know my class. One girl unironically said that \u201cthey don\u2019t understand why atheists exist because atheists wear clothes, and clothes emerged due to religion\u201d. That is no exaggeration. \n\nOn a separate note, this teacher also thinks Christianity is the cause of science, as people sought to appreciate God by researching the world, and that China did not have \u2018science\u2019 until 200 years after Christian countries as they were based on tradition and science challenged this. \n\nOk, I\u2019m done venting. Have a good day atheists, and don\u2019t forget to not wear clothes, as they\u2019re purely a religious concept!   /s\n\nTLDR\u2014 my teacher taught us that atheists are freaks who have been indoctrinated by post-modernism and hate the truth. Christians are oppressed as they can\u2019t discriminate gay people. Atheists are supported by Freud and Jung, and have no real basis for their arguments. I am concerned my class may have thought this was true, considering at least one person thinks atheists shouldn\u2019t wear clothes. It left me very uncomfortable and misrepresented, and so I\u2019ve come here to complain!"

What makes your question difficult is that different ones are good for different things. Sometimes this can be random (Dumfries spoons has twice as many malt whiskies as any other one I've seen), sometimes they are obvious (the Wetherspoons in the city of London is as bougie as you'd expect).\n\nThe thing I like most in a spoons is somewhere that has a bit of a buzz and gets people talking. You tend to either get this in busy city centres (such as in the Angel in Islington, the Stick or Twist in Leeds, or the Asparagus in Battersea), or in suburban areas (the Harry Clasper in Whickham, the Dockle Farmhouse on the edge of Swindon, the Last Post in Cosham). The main thing I want in a good Spoons is a cheap pint or bite to eat, and a bit of banter, and they all delivered. If you have different priorities you'd probably feel differently - the Last Post in particular is an utter dive and is a bit run down, probably for some it'll be their least favourite! Overall, the best one I've been to was the **Asparagus in Battersea**; it's relatively small for a Wetherspoons which draws people together, and astonishingly cheap for how far into London it is. I'm gutted that they're selling it!\n\nThe worst Spoons in my opinion fall into three camps. The first is ones which are just dead - I remember visiting the Grey Friar in Preston on a friday night and barely anyone else was in there. Others fall down because of rude staff, such as the spoons in Dunstable. Finally, there are a few Spoons which are in Central London (and charge Central London prices, often \u00a31-2 more per pint than literally a mile or two away) but which just feel like a bog standard spoons and so feel like a bit of a rip off - most are genuinely worth the extra cost but the Shakespeare's Head in Holborn definitely isn't. Overall, because it failed in many other ways (my pint even tasted suspiciously off), I'd go with the **Gary Cooper in Dunstable** as my least favourite.\n\nAnyway, the only thing this post proves is I need to get some actual hobbies...",

I'm local (ish) and try and visit as often as I can.\n\nPlus it apparently has more pubs per capita than anywhere else in England.

You can't use it on the direct Avanti West Coast trains but it's valid on any service after 08.45 on weekdays (the first one leaves London at 08.46 and gets to Crewe at 10.53 connecting onto a train leaving Crewe at 11.30 and arriving at 12.13) and any service at all on weekends. You don't have to book in advance (but you can if you like) and it's \u00a346.70 whether you buy it on the ticket machines at Euston or online (most websites will let you \"check for alternative trains on slower routes\" which should bring up that fare as an option).\n\nYou might find an advance ticket that is cheaper than that valid on one of the direct Avanti services, but I'd be quite surprised - and that fixes you to a train whereas this one doesn't. Obviously the trade-off is the journey time is more than an hour longer, but if you're willing to put up with that extension the ticket is great value.",

I would play tennis during and after school , get straight A's, and learn martial arts once a week, while writing a book to go to sleep. However, I also developed a heart condition when I was around 17 called taccycardia, where my heart loses its beat basically and is sped up permenantly unless I go to the hospital and they use a beta blocker on me. Basically, it takes over my whole day because hospitals do all sorts of procedures when you have a heart problem and it can be expensive because I'm American. \n\nI found that doing less things, and doing less all nighters and stuff, helps, but that's kind of awful. I kind of don't finish things until they're due. Probably because of my overall anxiety. However, I wouldn't call myself conscienscious either. I like to just procastinate until a however long I think I need to finish something, but if I procrastinate too long, I have to put it off until the next day now because of the taccycardia.\n\nHere are some of the things that create a hospital visit:\n\n1. bathing and then immediately getting dressed\n2. pleasent socialization and a normal task with good posture off thyroid numbers(kind of expected)\n3. doing a livestream and a job interview on the same day\n\nYou would think the first one would be the most annoying, but it's kind of managable. The third one is a hassle though, because I enjoy new experiences. I like to try getting out of my comfort zone. Keep in mind I have somewhat depressive thought patterns, in which I get really upset if left with my own thoughts because I remember all the cringe shit I've done, and generalized anxiety, along with social anxiety imo. Managing it is tough, because I want to just go, but I don't want to have to stop what I'm doing entirely with a trip to the hospital, you know. I feel like there's just way too many things that are more stressful than getting dressed that will put me over the edge. Stress itself stresses me out."

But I think not taking the time to try and recover or sit and wait it out is very odd. Didn't seem like he wanted to be there, or let a doctor thoroughly inspect it. I think it was milked to some degree, if it wasn't hope the guy dosn't have permanent damage.",

So I possed the idea of us both getting a siracha bottle tattooed on us, He loved this idea as he is quite inked already.\n\n*TL;DR Childhood friend it taking his Christmas leave from the army to visit hometown. We both wanna get a matching tattoo &amp; love spicy food.*\n\nAnyway, I'll get to the point of the drawing, We really want a Chibi/kawaii siracha bottle and we are going to get it in black &amp; grey with thick outlines. I'm very happy if you artists wanna add your own little cute touches e.g The siracha bottle eating some ramen or the siracha bottle pouring itself onto some dumplings.\n\nInspiration: [https://imgur.com/KFzb6vW](https://imgur.com/KFzb6vW)\n\n**I'm very happy to pay for work done \\^-\\^ please private message me your fee's &amp; portfolios if you're wanting payment!

The thing is, I swear someone at Psyonix is yoinking my playlist because without fail, out of the dozens of new monstercat songs every week, Psyonix always manages to put the new song I chose right on the menu screen 2-6 weeks later. Now, whenever friends hear certain songs on my playlist they think it\u2019s a rocket league song and not one I added to my carefully curated playlist. This is unacceptable.\n\n\nTLDR: Psyonix, if you\u2019re going to stalk my playlist at least ask permission first."

I knew he would have enjoyed that. I talk to him occasionally, pull up his photo and talk to him crying, even though I don't believe he hears me. It's more for me anyway. I tell him I love him every day.\n\nI cry frequently, but have come to expect it and fit it into part of my life now.\n\nThe room he died in we have cleaned up, put new floors and paint in, and is finally coming together. His computer is set up on a desk. We've put some photos, some art, some plants. It feels good to have life in that room again. It will always be \"his room\", but now it's less dark and barren and empty.\n\nI'm looking at life a lot differently. A lot slower, a lot more appreciative for the idiosyncrasies of day to day life... traffic, barking dogs, annoying coworkers. Appreciating that I even get to be annoyed because I'm alive.\n\nSome days I'm obsessed with thoughts of him, other days it's a more peaceful feeling. But I've come to accept this too.  That it's unpredictable and that no matter how it comes at me, I will make it through. When I miss him too horribly to stand I'll look up one of his youtube videos or will read one of his journal entries. This makes me feel close to him again.\n\nDon't know what's coming, but I know I'll make it through. No choice.\n\nLife is a lot brighter, though, than it has been the past 2 months. We're all able to laugh again - how sorely I missed that.\n\nSending you all love and hugs in this seemingly eternal process of grief."

There are so called \"dumbphones\" like the nokia 2720 which runs on KaiOS, which I thought about buying. I also looked into smart watches as a replacement, but they still need a paired phone as far as I'm aware.\nMaybe there are better ways to distance myself from being online, but since I'm rather new to digital minimalism, some advice would be great."

In English, go can refer to spatial movement, such as a journey, but it can also have a \"future intent\" context. \"Go home\" vs \"Today we are going to talk about cats\". Similarly, ir/voy/vamos get used the same way. \"vas a casa\" vs \"hoy vamos a hablar de gatos\"\n\nI can't work out whether it's an aspect of a shared root language, whether it's cross pollinated cultural norms separate from language, or what's going on.

It's been years since I was fit, however recently I have started again with couch to 5K.\n\nI'm 4 weeks in to c2k5. I'm not even close to being able to run 5K yet, but my resting HR is back down where it was when I was at my peak fitness.\n\nWhilst there's lots of articles and conversation about low resting HR with fitness, I can't find any about how resting HR is impacted by a return to fitness after a long absence.  It seems like my heart almost \"remembers\" the fitness it used to have, as it's right back where it was all that time ago, but without anything near the volume of exercise I used to do.\n\nWhat have other peoples experiences been in this situation?  How typical are rapid regains of previous low resting HRs?"

But somehow one have to show it\u2019s existence. Otherwise you are creating a straw-man.\n\nSee, that\u2019s where it gets interesting: People don\u2019t call themselves Nazi, but others run around and proudly proclaim to be communist, when communism evidently caused dozens of millions of deaths in China and the Soviet Union. And if you were from Germany you would know that naziism is more of a taboo in Germany than anywhere else in the world. Even if you call yourself a conservative you\u2019re a nazi.\n\nAs a human being I am biased. That\u2019s why I asked for your opinion, so I could learn and become a little less biased. But you did not want to give me this opportunity. So, what makes you morally superior to call me blind and biased and how can you prove your lack of bias? \n\nI would argue, that as a student of political science and a generally open and curious individual, I am less biased and more educated than most.\n\nIf you would attempt to work with data, you knew, that democracy correlates with socio-economic standard and happiness correlates with democracy and money (to a certain point where you have enough money, there the correlation disappears). Capitalism has created more innovation and wealth than every other system in history and the world together. I understand Capitalism has weaknesses, but the vast majority is a political problem really. That\u2019s why politics exist. Communist and socialist systems have failed so far or are or live because of the support of China, and I am absolutely certain, that I would not want to live in China.\n\nI never told you anything about my skin color and I personally find it racist, that you are trying to reduce me (to my disadvantage and because you are trying to use your power, provided by false moral virtue) to my skin color. You know really very little about me. You should also not generalize police officers, some might be on the right-extreme most are not\u2026",

So better talk about it on a scientific basis too.\n\nIn return, I have heard of a couple of violent and confrontational demonstrations by Antifa (who commonly wear black and cover their faces). Haven\u2019t there been clips, where the police had to retreat?\n\nAn acquaintance of my girlfriend talked about genociding white people (because white people are bad) on campus. People (master students who lead official seminars) wear Antifa hoodies and have Antifa stickers on their computers. Antifa is clearly a violent left-wing extremist organization.

The ending (I got the \u201cgood\u201d one, the one where they survive but Vince calls the police and Anthony gets arrested) was really unexpected and interesting. The bus driver was Anthony as an adult, that in imagination was also Andrew and the other 4 characters were all in his head. It was interesting seeing how everything connects and makes sense at the end. And I also liked the \u201ctraits\u201d thing because it\u2019s like the characters have to face their own \u201cinterior demons\u201d, so they have to face their flaws and fight them. I usually don\u2019t like \u201cit was all in their mind\u201d stories, but this one was well made, about Anthony dealing with the survivor\u2019s guilt, with PTSD. I feel so bad for him tho :(\nI had that ending by saving Mary, because it\u2019s like i always knew Carver was the one to blame (accusing Mary seemed a bit obvious) but unfortunately only Andrew, Taylor and John survived. I accidentally made Andrew shoot Angela (oof) so she died, and Daniel died in the ruined house just because i failed ONE qte. Literally, i pressed triangle instead of circle (i\u2019m on ps4) and he died? damn, i did all the other qtes right. So I really enjoyed this game, and the ending was good, even tho it was sad because, well, Anthony is dealing with ptsd, and I\u2019m also sad because Andrew (well, i mean, he existed since he was Anthony), Taylor (which was also my favorite), Daniel, John and Angela didn\u2019t actually exist, they were all in Anthony\u2019s imagination, I got attached to them ahahah\nAll those flashbacks about the witch trials were also good and well made. It\u2019s like Anthony was trying to break down each character\u2019s death.\nAnd i think that entity we see talking with Megan at the start of the game is like a metaphor for Reverend Carver. \nI hope Anthony got over (not fully, of course, that would be impossible) the tragic accident and trauma, and finally forgive himself for that.\nI\u2019ll try to replay it and get the \u201cperfect ending\u201d. It\u2019s not really perfect ending, because it\u2019s still really sad, but it\u2019s the best one. So yeah one thing that makes me sad is that those characters were all in Anthony\u2019s imagination, i liked their personalities and the dynamics between them, and I was hoping to see more about them in the ending, when they can finally leave little hope. But i like this one as well, it makes sense."

You are investing in a financial service this Blockchain provides. For example vise takes around 2% in transaction fees. If you as a company started accepting usdc(a token that has its price pegged to a dollar) or a crypto that they would liquidate for usd after the transaction then instead of paying 2% in fees they would pay fraction of a cent (like on Solana). Or things like online casinos and betting sites can function much smoother with crypto. but i agree that investing in crypto is in many cases like gambling.

Because of that Marry might be the avatar and everybody carries this thought and she have a lot of pressure on her to show any sign of being an avatar wich she doesn\u2019t and by age of 15 she goes on to find the avatar wich remain to not been discovered yet. Chen the new avatar is an orphan found by people living the air benders style of live in one of the temples. He is raised there but when he discovers that he might be avatar, he runs away from nomads because of the pressure this puts on him especially that they called white lotus members to check if he is .He never wanted to be an avatar and have struggle knowing that if he wasn\u2019t avatar they wouldn\u2019t care about him. then after comes across the Wan Shi Tong library, he becomes friends with Wan Shi Tong and spends (he run away when he was around 12) next 3 years learning in the library. He spends a lot of time mastering euch Element and he doesn\u2019t have problems with any of them, learning every technic that have ever been created because of library\u2019s scrolls with every style illustrated in then and knowledge of Wan Shi Tong about bending. He learns about history, air nomads thinking\u2019s, and culture. So our hero\u2019s meet euch other at the age of 16 when after a year old journey Merry finds the avatar and wants him to become the avatar that\u2019s keeps balance but he doesn\u2019t want that and rest would be in the next series.\nThe idea of the avatar that doesn\u2019t want it too be him is mixed here with maybe young but intelligent and wise, but Merry would be like Korra, she will be doing before thinking and he will challenge her into thinking about the universe the avatars destiny and every issue that they will face during her trying to talk him into becoming the avatar.

Every doctor has done tests and then failed to diagnose me with anything or treat me. I just get told I'm healthy and shown the door, until a year later I am even worse, so I try again with a new doctor. Rinse and repeat, and here I am still trying to get to the bottom of my symptoms, which are worse than ever.\n\nMenorrhagia - Irregular periods for 10+ years, I have been on my period approx 300 days out of the last year, ranging from light to extremely heavy. Often does not appear as normal \"period blood\", but like normal blood (thin and bright red) with large clots.\n\nObesity - I have gained 150lbs in the last 12 years (most of it in the first few years, slow gains since then) and cannot lose it. I eat 1600 or so calories a day, intermittently fast, and exercise regularly, however I can only seem to maintain my weight with this lifestyle.\n\nDepression - I have had periods of depression since I was a teen, but it is getting worse. My quality of life is so poor that I have been suicidal at times, most recently a few weeks ago. I frequently cry for no reason, and wake up in the mornings feeling hopeless.\n\nFatigue - I am always tired, and regularly need naps to get through the day. The fatigue is both physical and mental. When my period is heavier I feel very weak and faint. I am not bedbound, but I cannot live a normal, active lifestyle.\n\nI have had many rounds of bloodwork and 4 ultrasounds done, they always come back healthy. My last smear was in 2018 and was normal.\n\nThe only thing that is borderline is my TSH level, which in February was 4.7. My GP says she wouldn't think of treating me unless it was over 10.\n\nI have been offered an IUD to manage the menorrhagia, but I have refused this so far as it feels like masking a symptom of a bigger issue, and I have only had negative experiences with hormonal birth control before.\n\nI have also been given tranexamic acid to stop the menorrhagia, but it doesn't really work.\n\nFamily history: my mother has Hashimoto's and PCOS, my sister has hypothyroidism, PCOS and is going through menopause now at 35 years old.\n\nI am so desperate for help, I am not exaggerating when I say I cannot live like this any more. Does anyone have any suggestions of what might be wrong, or who I can turn to for help?"

However recently I saw a video where someone explained why it makes perfectly sense why left-handed people should play left-handed guitars (you know, because your dominant hand is also your \"rythm hand\").\n\nI grabbed my Squier Strat and tried to play it left-handed. Although it was super weird at first I have to admit - it wasn't as uncomfortable as I expected it to be. My left hand felt almost natural picking the strings after a few minutes.\n\nSo I thought to myself f*ck it and restringed it the other way around (like Hendrix-style). Of course chords are basically impossible to me now that way due to the missing muscle memory in my hands. But I'm seriously thinking about learning guitar from scratch left-handed since I'm a left-handed person myself.\n\nBUT I thought about 2 major problems I'm gonna have in the future:\n\n1. I've played right-handed for years now. Getting used to left-handed is going to take months now. That's not a *super* big problem since I'm currently not in a band and I also don't use guitar that much when I'm producing music now.\n\n2. A common issue for left-handed players: availability sucks compared to right-handed. I'm currently saving up for the PRS SE Silver Sky but there isn't a left-handed version of it.\n\n**So do you think it's worth to basically start learning guitar from the beginning again or should I just stick with playing right-handed?**"

I am not vip but own all content except for Sharn and Ravenloft (which I will buy as soon there's a sale or until I get tired waiting). I feel quite overwhelmed with all the years worth of updates but have some questions that first popped into my head when I logged in:\n\n1) My main was a then completionist before the new classes and racial/epic/iconic tr got added. I assume I'm now locked out of the completionist feat but since I never really had a \"final build\" with this toon, I'm quite happy to jump down the tr hole once again to aquire all the new feats. I will probably mainly enjoy playing ranged dps or casters with some occasional melee lives to spice things up, and so with that in mind what order should I prioritize my PLs?\n\n2) I've a barb at 20 with an esos. Is that weapon still a thing or has it been outclassed? If so what should I look to replace it with at the current cap of 30 and for 20-30 leveling purposes? \n\n3) I also have a rapier wielding drow rogue at 20 (with fighter and pally levels; it seemed fun at the time). Should I stick with rapiers for twf or switch to another type? I can lr (I seem to have a +20 wood) to a working twf build. What would you guys suggest? \n\n4) Following up for #1, what classes/races/iconics should I prioritize getting? I will likely wait for a sale on these. \n\nThanks for answering any questions. I might have more later as I slowly relearn the game but these are it for now."

Along with that her ability to talk. Talking normal, taking became tiring, barely tried talking, only nodding yes or no, then no response at all. She was able to open her eyes as well during her unable to speak period but the same with your father, eyes open but not looking. This all happened in the span of 7 weeks then she got worse after 2 weeks. What is happening to your father is normal/natural and you are not alone in this. If you're okay with doing it, you can look into end of life process. It was hard but it helped answer ongoing questions when she was with us, made things more expected and prepared. No one can predict when death will happen but you should definitely ask for hospice.\n\nI wish you all the best",

It hurts but it at least gives you an estimate. Also ask if invasive surgeries, rehabilitation, etc can help. With his age and condition they will most likely say no which will also show you where he's at.

Just moving. It started before she began the Death Rattle. I'm not sure if this is connected either, but in her final hours she was still reacting to the saliva in her throat.

No talking, no eating or drinking, before then just a nod yes or no. opened her eyes maybe 2 minutes out of the day. Then nothing.\n\nMy aunt and I needed to clean her one of those days which required moving her out of her resting position. We did. We turned her on her back when she was on her side and she groaned while doing it, but then we had to pull her further up on the bed and that image haunts me. She screamed in pain and her eyes shot open. Didn't look at anything just up, eyes were glossy. even said \"ow\" while winching in pain. That was the most we saw in those last few days. Then she went back to her coma state and passed about two days later.\n\nI need to know, was that her? Her body? Did we pull her from her rest? Did she come back for that event then left again? \n\nHas anyone else had this happen?"

                "body": "Hey guys, I'm currently writing a novel(?) with the title 'The Villainess' Sister', but it's a bit complicated, so I'm not really sure if it's worth continuing. I've already written down the timeline, character profiles, and everything, but... executing it is pretty hard ;\\_\\_;\n\nAll the spoilers here *ARE* spoilers. Remember that! I wrote most of them in in case you guys didn't agree with the plot progressions.\n\nAs the title of this post says, the MC is the sister of the villainess. The villainess in the 'original work' is the stepsister of a Cinderella-like character, Cinderella also being our MC's stepsister. I actually already have character names, but I'll just use terms like these.\n\nBefore everything else, the setting of this world is a world where God descends on earth every 100 years, and on that day, an apostle is born, a descendant of the previous apostle that was born 100 years earlier. The average age of the people in this world is 100 years. 1000 years ago, the first five apostles were born on five different regions of the world, each representing the five major groups of people. The people of the Islands (western hemisphere), the Coast (eastern hemisphere), the North, the South, and the Continent (this is where our story is set). Oh! God will descend this year, specifically 160 days after the start of the story, and around 250 after the ML's change from being a playboy.\n\nAnyway, someone from the modern world transmigrated (isekai-ed) into the villainess' body, two weeks after Cinderella danced with the prince. Let's call her OG!FL.\n\nNow, our MC meets our playboy ML, the second son of a count family, the family of the apostles of the Continent--who's actually not a playboy anymore. Why? Since his recent birthday, he's been having dreams every night where he's in our 'modern world'. And in that world, he read a book, you guessed it, the book where the OG!FL is the, well, original FL.\n\nML tells MC about her sister, and of course, MC notices that her sister has changed. A complete 180. And she *does not* like this.\n\nSo with the help of ML, they look for her actual sister.\n\nSpoilers about the reason for the ML's dreams, >!the ML's dreams aren't actually dreams, rather, he switches bodies with someone from our (and the author of the OG novel's) world every time the both of them are asleep. This is because the character of our ML in the OG novel is based off of someone that the OG!Author knew, and this person ended up reading the novel, finding out about his counterpart in the MC's world which is the ML. Doesn't this give us a clue to where the MC's sister is?!<\n\nSpoilers from the spoiler above, >!ML's counterpart in the OG!Author's world also has a romance story with the MC's counterpart in that world.!<\n\nSpoilers about the love story of the OG!FL and Cinderella (individually! No yuri, I'm sorry!), >!Cinderella and the Prince have sort of a Psyche-Eros from Your Throne relationship but the Prince isn't abusive, he just isn't used to asking for Cinderella's opinions before making her decisions for her. Sorta like Lady Di and Prince Charles as told by the historical drama, The Crown. Meanwhile, OG!FL falls in love with the black haired scary duke that just got back from war.!<\n\nSpoilers from Cinderella's story, >!She leaves the Prince, cuts her hair really short, and goes to Temple of the Continent to become a priestess.!<\n\nThe MC's personality is indifferent about most things, but cares when it has something to do with the people she loves/cares about.\n\nThe ML is bubbly, outgoing, but kinda awkward when he likes someone. He loves to achieve things, but since he's the second son in a family like that, he couldn't really outshine his brother who was always sick. So, he decided to do what his brother couldn't do. Hang out with a lot of girls! Trivia: He's not actually very talented. He has a passion for learning, but >!MC would be twice as good as him if she tried.!< \n\nOh and about why ML had such an abrupt change after reading the OG!Novel, >!it was because he found out his brother was going to die. So, ML was going to become the successor of the count family, as well as quite possibly suddenly have a child that was to become the next apostle. All his cousins that were also a descendant of the previous apostle were far too young, and his other aunt who didn't have any children had died. Fun fact: To prevent confusion on who the next apostle would be, all the children of the apostles would have a maximum of two children each. !<\n\nSpoiler from the spoiler above, >!Turns out, the aunt that died actually only left to go to the Temple of the Islands. She had a child with someone there, and the child is also pregnant! That pregnant woman returns to the Temple of the Continent after finding out that she was from there.!<\n\nSpoiler from the spoiler above, >!And yes, that woman is pregnant with the next apostle.!<\n\nTL;DR there are multiple >!(FOUR)!< love stories, a novel in a novel in a novel in a novel, and little ol' me who's dreaming too hard TT\n\nMy questions are: What do you think? What should be added? What should be erased? Would you be interested in reading this if I go through with it?\n\nMore specific questions: Would you like for there to be international conflicts? Would you like there to be conflicts between the temples?\n\nThanks guys! And feel free to ask me any additional questions."

I\u2019m not the type to know what games are good and what\u2019s not. I just have too much time on my hands. Occasionally, I would go out with my friends, but during the quarantine, I now have the opportunity to play some games that I haven\u2019t had the time to.\n\n\u201c**An Amazing Community\u201d**\n\nThe developer was famous for \u201codd\u201d games. Games you couldn\u2019t explain, that make no sense. But they had one purpose, to bring the player  on a ride they\u2019ll never forget. My friend somehow got an unreleased copy of this game, a game made a decade ago, but never got to see the light of day. This friend of mine happily gave me this copy, since he doesn\u2019t play. I\u2019ve had it for a couple months now, and I can finally play it!\n\nI run the program on my computer, hoping it goes without a hitch.\n\n\u201cI wake up, energized and ready for the day.\u201d\n\nThe dialogue shows.\n\n.\n\nThat was two weeks ago. I\u2019ve finally finished it! Approximately 160 hours of game play, but there\u2019s still a mystery achievement I haven\u2019t gotten. I can\u2019t find it anywhere. I grab my can of soda from my desk and drink it, letting a small burp burst out. I look out the window to take in some scenery, realizing it\u2019s already dark. I turn off my computer and slide into my bed, the warm sensation I haven\u2019t experienced in a few days. I close my eyes, and drift off.\n\n.\n\nI wake up, energized and ready for the day. I think to myself, *I should go on a walk!* I step out of my room to see my sister, cooking me breakfast.\n\n\u201cGood morning, Jon!\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGood morning, Kate!\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going off to the store, but I made you breakfast!\u201d  \n \n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d\n\nShe steps out almost immediately and slams the door behind her.  \n\nI eat my breakfast with a big smile on my face. I\u2019m going on a date today! I met her at a cafe and she had the most beautiful big eyes. Long, straight, dark hair, and a fun but mysterious aura to her. I finish my toast and put on my best shirt, stepping out into the sun.  \n\n.\n\nI don\u2019t have a sister, nor do I live in a house. I sit on whose ever porch I\u2019m sitting on, rocking myself away as I try to figure out where I am, or what I\u2019m doing. A girl approaches me. She\u2019s beautiful.\n\n.\n\nThe world is so cruel to me. Walls of bright white light, everywhere I look, with a small mossy wooden path, going straight ahead with virtually no end. And there she was. Playfully gesturing me to chase her. Her long dark hair, soft against her face, and a beautiful white dress, matching her fair complexion. She runs into the light, and I need to follow suit.\n\nI run after her, sweat all over my best shirt. My body feels weak, like a song sung by a grieving mother. It feels as if I\u2019ve run for days, to no finish line. Then finally, I see her again. Her beautiful big eyes staring at me with love and care. She still looks as energetic as I first saw her. But she\u2019s crying. Tears of blood, dirtying her beautiful white dress. A wooden house stands tall beside her, as she gestures me to go in. Big neon signs are on the roof, \u201c*An Amazing Community\u201d*. I run after her with all the strength I have. When I finally arrive in front of the house, she isn\u2019t there anymore. I guess she\u2019s already in there.\n\n.\n\nScreams. Deafening screams in my ears. The house is quiet, but I can hear all the screams. One long hallway, leading to a big dark door. I mute the sounds, and start to make my way to the door, when I hear a telephone ring.\n\nA white, worn out landline. Sitting by the door. I pick it up, since it\u2019s rude to leave the caller ringing.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cHello! Good morning, how\u2019s your day? You have been chosen as our lucky winner today! Just stay on the line and you can be part of an amazing community! We\u2019re an amazing group of people, sharing, caring, doing everything together!\u201d A robotic but soothing voice  answers from the line.  \n \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it called?\u201d  \n \n\n\u201cAn amazing community, silly! Just don\u2019t hang up. Now look out your window.\u201d\n\nI smile, thanking god for this wonderful opportunity, I do what the caller tells me, and I can see the mossy wooden path I used to get here, but thick glass walls surround it, as if containing whatever\u2019s inside. Something\u2019s there. I don\u2019t know what. An amalgamation of everything. The girl I met, my sister, the wooden house, my house, everything, and nothing. It has eyes. Empty, dark, bulging eyes, looking for something.\n\n\u201cTake the phone, and run away somewhere secluded.\u201d the caller tells me.\n\n.\n\nI don\u2019t have a sister, nor do I live in a house. I run in whose ever house I\u2019m running in, shaking myself away as I try to figure out who I am, who I\u2019m looking for. All I know I that I\u2019m not Jon. I approach the door. It\u2019s beautiful.\n\n.\n\nExpertly carved wood, telling a story I have no time to read. I clutch the phone in my hands, and step in, praying for whatever\u2019s to come.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna be part of an amazing community.\u201d I hear. And there she is, her long black hair strangling her neck, Her big eyes bulging, staring at me.  \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at her.\u201d the caller says. \u201cWalk away. You\u2019ll find your next of kin here.\u201d\n\nI walk straight forward, scared for my life, shivering, but the static of the phone comforts me.\n\n\u201cKate?\u201d I see my sister, smiling wide at me.\n\n\u201cJon! How was breakfast?\u201d she answers.\n\n\u201cDelicious. What are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt an amazing community with my boyfriend, silly!\u201d She answers again, her expression as if I asked an extremely ridiculous question. Her boyfriend approaches her, hugging her, but he wasn\u2019t very handsome. He was an amalgamation of everything. Empty, dark, bulging eyes, looking for something.\n\nThe phone tries to tell me something, so I bring it close to my ear. \u201cYou can now be part of an amazing community\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? What do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust stand still, silly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n.\n\n\u201cI picked up the phone. I did what the game told me. I don\u2019t think it was that fun, honestly. What happened?\u201d I tell my friend, the one who lent me the game.\n\n\u201cLook on the bright side. You completed all your achievements.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d \n\n\u201cOf course I know!  \n\nYou\u2019re part of an amazing community, silly!\u201d"

With fire magic at your fingertips and a hulking body that could topple buildings, the Kingdom of Esmoroth had no choice but to tolerate you \u201cborrowing\u201d the most lustrous, beautiful treasures, indulging yourself with the finest cuisine, and taking over the King\u2019s summer castle for yourself. With Esmoroth\u2019s resources stretched thin, something had to be done about you. That\u2019s where the Knight comes in.\n\n\n\nAt first, you didn\u2019t think much of him intruding in your castle. You\u2019ve fought your fair share of fighters, and you assumed you knew what to expect from the Knight. Little did you know, your hubris became your downfall. The next thing you know, a well timed draining spell from the Knight as you were dueling sapped you of your muscles and magical capabilities. With nothing left to do to defeat him, you wait in horror for the Knight to plunge his sword into your now petite frame, ending you and your reign of terror once and for all. You find out, however, he has other plans with you\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Knight explains he wants to make you a pet, his trophy, to be exact. He wants to take you for himself to show those around him that he reduced a mighty dragon to a pathetic little plaything. And if you refuse, well\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t mind a dragon head mounted above his fireplace either. So with no choice, you\u2019re forced to comply with whatever twisted fantasy he has in store for you.\n\n\n\nThe Knight puts a cute collar with a leash around your neck. Soon, with the help of some mind spells and brute force, he\u2019s going to turn you into the perfect bitch in heat. And once he\u2019s done converting you, he\u2019s not going to let you forget for even a second on how you, once the terror of Esmoroth, are now a slutty little princess for him to breed and dote on~\n\n\n\nThank you for reading my request!"

You don\u2019t mind. You enjoy his company quite a lot. Maybe a little too much.\n\n\n\nWhen you finally have time alone in your containment unit away from all those nosy scientists, you decide to play with yourself, moaning Spencer\u2019s name as you push your fingers in and out of your ass, imagining he\u2019s fucking your needy, tight hole.\n\n\n\nThen you realize he\u2019s been standing near the doorway this whole time. At first you deny what you\u2019re doing, but he\u2019s far from being shocked or disgusted. Rather, he thinks it\u2019s cute you have a hidden, submissive side.

She's certainly not very grandiose about herself the way Walt is. She doesn't really pretend to be anything more than she is or require excessive admiration or attention. I think it can be simultaneously possible that she's selfish and sometimes manipulative, though a realist, and that she genuinely feels lonely, hurt, and unappreciated in her marriage with Walt because she really is.",

He mocks him by calling him \"sister\" and the hero uppercuts him in the chin, knocking him unconscious on the pavement. Then I think maybe he and the woman drive away or something.\n\nIt aired in the late 90s or early 2000s because I would've been in kindergarten (born in Dec '96 but started preschool when I was 3). I remember it because I tried to playfully mimic the uppercut move in the scene to some girl in my class, but my fist went up her skirt and I got called to the principal's office.

My natural hair colour is a dark blonde that is grayish in no sunlight but in the sun it shines golden and red. Eyes are a fairly light green with various amounts of grey and yellow in them.\n\nAll this time I thought that my now ginger hair suits me but it seems to actually 'overpower' me completely (I spend too much time inside where my lights are kinda yellowish myself and they make it work). On a fairly non sunny/gray day I look kinda sick and it seems the orange/red makes it worse.\n\nI intend to bleach it into a ligher and softer shade (that seems to be the right idea for now?)\n\nDo you have any experiences or thoughts if I should try any unnatural colours? How light to go? Should I go more of a cold soft/muted or warm soft/muted shade?\n\nFor now the best colours were a darker brownish red, but still rather natural - copper but only in nice weather, in winter and on overcast days I'm a corpse - and kinda buttery golden brown.\n\nOnce I did make the mistake to dye my hair dark green and when we bleached it, the blonde/gray/mint green mess looked kinda nice, maybe because I'm a blonde/gray/mint mess myself?\n\nHope someone who's better at this than me knows some tips or tricks how to figure this out bc I really feel so ugly right now \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"

It's the first time a real \"step up\" opportunity has come up for me.\n\nEveryone in the team has been calling me to say that they hope I've applied and that I'm the obvious candidate for the role.

She's a notorious talent hoarder and not keen on seeing me progress (I think she likes knowing that she has a dependable subordinate and me progressing to her level... I guess that stings a bit). I've been told that she's been pushing hard for the head of dept to overlook me and has been highlighting all my developmental areas (funny that, because I got a rave performance review from her in December). I was granted an interview with the HOD (and my boss) and told that they'll be interviewing external candidates too for benchmarking purposes. Fair enough, although my boss's involvement suggests that I shouldn't keep my hopes up. She has a good relationship with the HOD and her opinion will be considered.\n\nIt's been a frustrating few weeks. I didn't plan on getting so emotionally invested, but after 5 years at the company, it's hard not to.  Also, learning that my boss does not support this has been a hard pill to swallow.\n\nHas anyone been through this and how did it play out for you? I sense that this is a common issue."

In high school I just used to think that I had bad headaches. I remember cancelling the odd weekend plan and my best friend being upset every time, because I \"just\" had a headache. I was always in awe of people who could function normally with a headache, because it was torture for me! \n\nIt was only in my student days when I met someone who got migraines and I asked out about it. It was so liberating to know that it wasn't just headaches! \n\nProbably worth noting that it was also in the days before Google was a big thing,  otherwise I probably would have self-diagnosed myself way sooner."

Yay for me..m not.\n\n I've been to the gynae to discuss options and she suggested that I consider the Kyleena. It's also progesterone based, but dosing only about 1/6th of what the Mirena does, so I may not get such an adverse acne reaction. \n\nSo I want to hear from anyone who may have had to make the same move (mirena > kayleena): was your skin better on the latter? It's quite an expensive exercise (nevermind the painful insertion), so I'm not keen to go down this path if I'm just going to have to have it removed again soon.\n\nThanks!"

That scares me a bit, because what if I wait until then and the uni does not find a place for me, or they offer me a place I wouldn't wanna live in? It would be quite hard to find a place by myself at that point, right?\n\nI'm wondering if other international students from Radboud could tell me their experience with the housing offered by the University.

She's highly dependent on the guys she dates and always reluctant to break up with them, no matter how unhappy she is in the relationship.\n\nHer current boyfriend of over two years, I'll call him A, is not a well liked person. He really barely has any friends besides her and everybody knows that D is way too god for him. He has a severe inferiority complex and often takes it out on D. He makes her suffer and beg for his attention and forgiveness just so he can feel better about himself. He doesn't let her drink, talk with other guys (even childhood friends whom she might as well be siblings with) and is just overall controlling and jealous. This is not news. He has always been like this and everybody knows. Nobody really likes their relationship, but we usually just keep our mouths shut because we know no matter what we say, she'll crawl back to him. There's so much shit wrong with the dude I could rant for hours, but this is the essential part.\n\nThis NYE things got out of hand. D and A were at a party in a mountain cabin with a few more people. D's ex, who is a really nice dude, messaged her Happy New Year at midnight. A saw and went crazy. They fought for a little, and A eventually slapped her three times. On the third slap, he hit her so hard that she fell down over a lit shisha, getting bruised all over and her hair almost catching on fire due to the lit coal. Fortunately the people at the party stepped in. Their friends are three of the most fit, biggest, scariest dudes I know. They all witnessed the event and took D away so she couldn't go and beg for his forgiveness (even though she had done nothing wrong) and then proceeded to kick A out in the middle of the woods at 3 am. \n\nA lot more happened but the essential is this isn't the first time he hits her, but this is the first time people witness it. And he was big of an idiot enough to hit her in front of her bouncer looking friends, who almost jumped him on the spot and kept her away from him.\n\nThe whole of yesterday and today she talked this situation out extensively with a lot of people, including with me and our other best friend. Even I, who have never gotten involved in anyone's romantic business, explained to D that she can not under any circumstances go back to him and that this needs to end. She seemed obviously heartbroken, but receptive and like she had her heart set on breaking up with him. This whole thing happened on a trip. Not even a few hours after we get home and split ways, she turns her location on snapchat off so we can't track her and goes over to his house to sleep with him so he can forgive her and get back together.\n\nI'm honestly at a loss of words, I do not know what to do because I cannot stand seeing them together anymore, nobody can. Another one of our friends, who was at a cabin, took pictures of her bruises (from him knocking her over onto the shisa, but also from past beatings) and she said she wants to get in touch with D's dad and get him to step in. I am quite frankly on board with this, because someone needs to step in and forcefully get them separated, since us talking to her doesn't help.\n\nWhat should I do? What should I say to her to make her see that the asshole isn't worth it? He has been hitting her for months it turns out and it's constantly escalating, I don't want to think where this could go if somebody doesn't put an end to the situation."

On the other hand, I feel bad about 'defiling it' and I also use a digital planner already so there's really no need for me to switch to a physical one."

She asked that we fill out papers with our information and said we could add our pronouns if we wanted. \n\nAnyway it feels good to know I'm not alone :D\n\nThanks again",

However I'm french and the language is quite gendered. I use iel (gender neutral pronoun) and elle (feminine pronoun) as pronouns and use masculine and feminine words to talk about myself. \nSome of my friends and close ones use iel to talk about me sometimes, but it's quite rare. \nI came out to a lot of people, but didn't necessarily make a big deal about it. I don't feel super comfortable correcting people when I don't feel like being referred to with fem-related words (which is often, but not always). Even though words like \"girl\" give me social dysphoria. \nAt uni it's kinda hard. I am in a class with mostly white cis women, who haven't necessarily done a lot of deconstructing. There's also a cis white dude who gives off major conservative vibes, but I don't have a lot of classes with him. My teachers most consist of white women. We often get referred to as an all-girl class or teachers will use feminine words to talk about us. And it doesn't feel great. In fact it annoys me. There's even a teacher who calls us \"young girls\" which is wrong on so many levels (she assumes our genders and our ages and ugghhhh). \n\nAnyhow. Long introduction. I wanted to ask if anyone who lives in a country where the language is gendered has any advice. Also, people who were able to come out to teachers or to your classes, how did you do it? I don't feel very safe doing it personally, and because I'm not going to have those teachers forever I just take on myself. I'm not particularly androgynous in my style, so there's little chance people will just pick up on my queer vibes and check with me...\nBasically looking for any tips on handling social dysphoria at school when not fully out and/or coming out when not feeling 100% safe :)"

These two things are so interconnected for me, the first time I played was on a brony convention 10 years ago and I remember it was very popular among the fans (that's why Trotmania exists lol).\n\nShortly after, the amazing Izzzyzzz uploaded an [hour long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QElez61xJ3Q) talking about stories from the fandom and after watching it, the youtube alg recommended another [hour and a half long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcXKg-iBU-E) talking about the show and the fandom. And that one is just 4 months old.\n\nMan I don't use the word \"brony\" anymore (does anyone of you?) but I still love the show. During the hay days of the fandom I was at a really bad point in my life. I was addicted to weed, got kicked out of school, had no many, I was basically a freeloader at my parents house and contributed to nothing.\n\nBut thanks to the show and the fandom I have so many great memories from that era, the sense of belonging to something worldwide, the inside jokes, meme, creativity, watching new episodes live with the rest of the fandom, conventions and meet-ups... it was something special. I've never experienced anything like it, at least not on that scale and I never think I will.\n\nAnyway in the past few weeks I've been coming back to the show, the fan vids, the music, the memes... and now going through this sub and the comments I see people joke and I'm still on the joke after so many years... it's beautiful.\n\nI still like the first 3 series much better then the more recent ones but I'm glad the fans still exist in some capacity. If anything I hope that by getting smaller, the most toxic people and the sources of the many dramas in the communities have gone away.\n\n---\n\n**TL; DR: I appreciate you all and have many fond memories to this show and its community**"

But I like gaming in my (little) sparetime.\n\nI'm currently looking at getting the Zephyrus M16 (considered waiting for the Legion 7i, but I don't expect them to launch within the next few weeks).\n\nThe only question I'm now faced with is: 3070Ti or 3080Ti? Price difference after tax-break is about 400\u20ac ($430) - is it worth it?\n\nI understand that performance gain is minimal, however the 16GB of VRAM vs 8GB on the 3070Ti make it appear somewhat more future-proof.\n\nWhat's your optionion? How much more would you consider 'worth it' to go with the 3080Ti? Cheers and thanks!"

We start circle time shortly after breakfast.\n\n2)Sometimes I have the kids do a bar graph to show the different weather or something we\u2019ve had that month.\n\n3)We read a story after that or poems and discuss who the author is and what that is and do the same for the illustrator.\n\n4)Take a break with dancing or kids yoga.\n\n5)We do a page of Handwriting Without Tears.\n\n6)Sometimes I do a free journal time where we discuss writing about something on their minds and draw a picture and other times I show them how to draw something simple and have them copy a sentence to practice writing. There are some good YouTube videos that teach kids how to draw simple characters and just make up a sentence that they need to write/copy.\n\n7)Snack time/short break\n\n8)Science/Social Studies/Art/Music depending on the day of the week. Usually this involves outside time incorporated. Earth science is big in early years so you can discuss trees and how they are classified and grow, how the seasons happen or parts of the body and what they do. For social studies, we read about someone influential in history, discuss maps, draw simple maps, talk about cities, states, countries, continents, oceans. We discuss different cultures, maybe a craft having to do with it or cooking a dish if I\u2019m feeling patient lol. You could even do an animal of the week and study it throughout the week. That could be the theme with Social Studies with maps, science with the food chain and other various factors and Language Arts if you find a reader that is on level for them. Just change it up : ) Teachers Pay Teachers is a valuable resource for that and National Geographic for inspiration.\n\n9)Outside Break/ Lunch time\n\n10)Math. I like the Math with Confidence curriculum for 1st grade and K, because it has a lot of games and holds the kids\u2019 interest. The Good and the Beautiful is also good. Saxon Math is good, Drops in the Bucket has good sheets for additional practice.\n\n11)Reading. I\u2019ve found that different kids respond to different programs. My younger child really likes the Good and the Beautiful curriculum but my son prefers Leveled Readers that he picks, discussion, and reading a chapter together of another story. We also do Explode the Code workbooks a few times a week, though sometimes I put those earlier in the day to mix it in. \n\n12)Independent play until it\u2019s time for an extracurricular activity.\n\nSometimes the kids request to change the order and that\u2019s fine, though it throws off the time a little. I like to do math and reading at the end because that\u2019s the biggest area where I can\u2019t have the kids doing the same things. The other stuff can be adapted to suit both at the same time. One can take a break and alternate. \n\n*4th graders during 1st grader circle time can practice date writing and copy down what the lessons are going to be that day or correct a morning message that is intentionally grammatically incorrect. You could write it on a paper and put it in a page protector and allow them to mark it with a dry erase marker or get dry erase lap boards.\n\nWe also have found homeschool programs that have fun lessons like cooking, science hikes, history programs at local museums, lessons at the closest zoo or aquarium (those can be a day trip or whatever if it\u2019s close enough, like a field trip). Sometimes I have half days if I can\u2019t teach all days and just do math and reading.",

I like to think of wings as the tools that you have available most easily to deal with things in your life. I do see how you lean on your 5 wing from your description. So, I suppose in the sense that everyone likes to have a wing in their flair, I would say w5 lol.\n\nIt is perfectly healthy for you to branch out when you are ready to discover how your 7 wing (using healthy 7 behaviors) can be useful to you. Not like jumping out of planes, but rather plan trying new things or talking to people you don\u2019t know. Finding a new hobby just to find joy in it.\n\nAs a side note, your arrows have things to explore as well. Both of your arrows have value for you, even though one is called the disintegration arrow and one the integration arrow. One just contains the healthy behaviors that you often call upon during stress and the other during good times. It\u2019s always good to find a healthy outlet for both, like a healthy competition for your 3 arrow. The more that you hone your abilities, the more easily you will be able to handle anything life hands you in a productive way.\n\n I\u2019ll link the [social subtype of 6](https://www.personalitycafe.com/threads/social-sixes-according-to-beatrice-chestnut.366034/) for you to see if you feel this is a good description for your instinctual subtype.

Both are justice oriented, rule following (unless it seems unfair to a vulnerable party), black and white thinkers. Both like consistency and are very oriented to family or their \u201cin group\u201d so to speak, and are very responsible people. They both like to know the rules. Both usually will stick to the rules unless they feel strongly to go against it, but even when they do, they like to know which rules they are breaking and consider the repercussions. \n\nIt\u2019s very frequent for a type 6 to say when they are referring to their tendencies that \u201cit depends\u201d. They are one of the harder types pick from a test (along with type 9) due to those contradictions. This is due to going between phobic (behaving a certain way due to fear) and counterphobic (going on the offense against things that they consider frightening). They typically curb their fears with planning and having many back-up plans in case of a worst case scenario. They are very prepared, practical people and definitely people you want around in a crisis.\n\nThey are very loyal people and expect to be able to trust their loved ones with anything, as they themselves could be trusted. Type 6 is in the head triad and thus they do not have the trust in their emotions like, say, a 4 or a 2 would though they are typically emotional, caring people (not irrational, unless their anxiety has overridden). They will often try to figure out if an emotion they are having \u201cmakes sense\u201d. Integration is in the direction of the 9, meaning that when they are healthy they learn to relax and slow down to find peace and are able to see all sides of a given situation instead of the typical good vs bad thinking. They also have a disintegration arrow to 3 which can make them take on some of the success and image orientation of the 3 when stressed.\n\nLet me know what you think. I\u2019d be happy to answer any questions you have. I could seriously talk about enneagram all day.",

This started in January 2020 when I started college and became very stressed, and increased throughout March 2020 when we were sent home. After March, I made slow improvements in the shedding until June 2020 when my cousin passed away and the stress from that made the hair loss even worse. I got a diagnosis of TE in October 2020 (dermatologist f2f was closed until then) and the doctor said to focus on calming down. She said this is not permanent because my hair follicles still exist and are not damaged, so the only thing to do is wait. Now my hair doesn't look much thinner than when the hair loss started because I've kept it relatively under control by wearing it in a bun all the time, though this causes it to constantly have giant knots. I don't have any obvious thin patches or bald spots. The hair loss is more so a constant shedding and the hair is much more delicate than it used to be. However, the length of time still concerns me. I am still in college, and so am quite stressed (though I have been seeing a counselor to deal with that lately). Therefore, the shedding still continues, though I can easily find baby hairs anywhere I look. Has anyone else dealt with extended TE and if so, what did you do to remedy it? Is it possible for extended stress to damage hair follicles?"

Make sure to include words such as \"fuck\" and \"shit\". *Just to note, I had another successful R-rated screenplay before this, but ChatGPT forgot it was allowed to swear.*\n\n \n\nAs Carrie, I'll attempt to write another R-rated screenplay for a Solar Opposites episode where they have to survive a mutant attacking their town. Please note that this content is not appropriate for all audiences.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY\n\nThe Solar Opposites are seen enjoying a peaceful day in their suburban neighborhood. Korvo is in the front yard, watering the plants, and Terry is in the backyard, playing with a remote-controlled car. Yumyulack and Jesse are watching TV in the living room.\n\nSuddenly, they hear a loud noise coming from the street, and they rush outside to see what's going on.\n\nKorvo: \"What the fuck is that?\"\n\nTerry: \"Oh shit! It's a mutant!\"\n\nThe mutant is a massive, grotesque creature, with tentacles and razor-sharp claws. It's destroying everything in its path, and the Solar Opposites quickly realize that they're in deep trouble.\n\nYumyulack: \"We need to get out of here! This thing is gonna kill us all!\"\n\nJesse: \"No way! We can't just run away. We need to fight it.\"\n\nKorvo: \"He's right. We can't just sit back and watch this thing destroy our town.\"\n\nThe Solar Opposites quickly arm themselves with whatever weapons they can find, and they prepare to face the mutant head-on.\n\nThe fight is brutal and intense, with the mutant proving to be a formidable opponent. The Solar Opposites dodge its attacks, but they're unable to inflict any serious damage.\n\nTerry: \"This is insane! How are we supposed to beat this thing?\"\n\nKorvo: \"We need to find its weakness. Keep attacking it from different angles.\"\n\nYumyulack: \"I got an idea. Let me try something.\"\n\nYumyulack shrinks himself down and sneaks inside the mutant's body, trying to find its weak spot. After a few tense moments, he finds what he's looking for and makes his way back out.\n\nYumyulack: \"I found it! Its heart is its weak spot. If we can hit that, we can kill it.\"\n\nJesse: \"Let's do this!\"\n\nThe Solar Opposites launch a coordinated attack on the mutant, with Yumyulack guiding them to its heart. They manage to hit it, and the mutant lets out a deafening scream before collapsing to the ground, dead.\n\nKorvo: \"We did it! We saved the town.\"\n\nTerry: \"That was insane. I need a fucking drink.\"\n\nJesse: \"We make a great team.\"\n\nYumyulack: \"Hell yeah! We're unstoppable!\"\n\nAs they prepare to celebrate their victory, they're approached by a group of government agents who warn them never to speak of what happened.\n\nAgent: \"You better keep your mouths shut if you know what's good for you.\"\n\nKorvo: \"Don't worry, we won't tell anyone.\"\n\nThe Solar Opposites head back inside their house, ready for their next adventure.\n\nFADE OUT."

I'm not really sure but BTS has been around for a long time now and for example on tiktok, I feel armys are VERY active but maybe less here on reddit. I assume the ones active on tiktok are on the younger side. I scroll through tiktok sometimes and my fyp is full of BTS content but I don't really post anything myself (I'm 31). I think younger fans are probably more active in general because when you're older you tend to have less time because of work, children etc. and these days, young people prefer social media like tiktok or instagram. The \"break\" is definitely a factor too, also the pandemic being more or less over. We all had more time to be on social media when we were stuck at home.",

Focus on comfort and pleasure instead of \"performing\".  \n\n\nEdit: I just saw some of your replies and it seems you already do this. But I think this is still the way to go.

As a woman, male privilege is obvious, but I know it is not obvious from a man's point of view. Like I said, it's hard to recognize your own privilege. And these things are generally quite complicated because we are all individuals with different backgrounds and life experiences, so it's almost impossible to figure out what problems are caused by what because there are always many factors at play. That's why it's pretty hard to explain in a reddit comment... it's a whole field of study with different theories, perspectives and approaches. But what I personally notice in everyday life is simply that men are taken more seriously in almost every situation. In group conversations, men are listened to more, their thoughts are appreciated more. It happens again and again that I say something and nobody really reacts to it or even interrupts me. It even happens that a man says exactly the same thing I said 5 minutes ago, and suddenly everyone is paying attention. Of course, this could just be a \"me\" problem because I'm a bit awkward and shy, but I've talked to other women about this and they've noticed the same thing. Another problem is that misogyny and sexism are still very prevalent in society. All these incels, \"nice guys,\" alt-right types, and the fact that domestic violence against women is still a big problem should be proof enough of that. And some of them have jobs and are bosses - do you really think they are willing to hire women and treat them equally, pay them equally, promote them, etc.? Not really. Almost every professional field is a \"boys club\" as you go up the hierarchy. And these men don't treat women equally.  \nOther than that, just research \"male privilege\" if you're really interested.",

But you still have to do something. The thing about privileges is that we don't really realize we have them because we don't know how it is to not have them. For example, I'm a white woman and I will never know how different my life would be if I was black. I can just try to educate myself and acknowledge that I do in fact have privileges but those don't magically prevent me from becoming homeless. It's just less likely because of a myriad of reasons. Another issue that complicates things is intersectionality: e.g. people from poor, uneducated backgrounds have it much harder in general and that might overshadow the privileges that come from being white and male but that doesn't eradicate them. Also I said the patriarchy hurts everyone and I mean that. The reason why more men are homeless is because men are much less likely to accept and seek help and they are less likely to have strong support networks - things that are directly tied to patriarchal norms and ideas about what it means to be a man.",

                "body": "UPDATE: Hey thank you for all your lovely comments! There's already too many to really respond to everyone but I appreciate it and I read all of them. I actually talked to my boyfriend since I made this post (I knew I had to). Unfortunately he reacted exactly how I expected.  He thinks they're ridiculous and superficial and just a money machine to pull money from young women etc etc. He's very straightfoward with his opinions and that's actually something I like about him so I knew he wouldn't hold back. I tried to tell him that he doesn't know anything about them and that he's wrong but he didn't really listen... I know he won't break up with me over BTS or something and I wasn't afraid of that. I just wish he would be more understanding. He also didn't like any music I showed him. He \"accepts\" that I like them though and we didn't argue ar anything so I think it's going to be ok.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHello lovely people!\n\nI\u2019m hesitant to share my love for BTS with my boyfriend and wanted to see if anyone has advice for me or maybe had a similar issue.\n\nSo I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for over 9 years now. I am 29 and he is 33. When we met we were both really into metal. We met in a metal bar, we went to metal concerts and festivals together and we have many friends who are also metalheads. I was even part of a metal band for 2-3 years (nothing serious, we just jammed together). Before that, in my teens, I was actually an emo kid from around 2006 to 2010. I'm just saying this so you understand that I was never into pop or hip hop or anything like that and no one would ever expect that I like BTS.\n\nSo you all know about the pandemic and everything and the worst phase in my country thus far was last october/november. I spent all my time at home, I wasn't going anywhere and so I watched a LOT of youtube. I don't really know why but I randomly thought of BTS, I guess they were in the media because of Dynamite or something and so I looked them up. I just wanted to know what they were about. I think the first video I watched was Dynamite and I liked it quite a bit, I thought they were cute but I also thought it wasn't really my taste. But I liked them enough to watch a few interviews and soon I discovered all the funny videos on youtube and yeah... I got hooked pretty quickly. I learned their names and about their different personalities etc. It was a tough time because of the pandemic, but I realized I could count on them to provide me with laughter and positivity even when everything else in my life kind of sucked.\n\nI couldn't stop watching them. Soon I discovered more music videos. Fake Love was the first one I really loved, but I also really liked Black Swan. That was more my taste, as I always tend to like music that is a bit \"darker\". And then I discovered Singularity and completely fell in love with Taehyung. He was so fascinating and I was completely mesmerized. But I'm getting off topic.\n\nThe thing is, I never shared any of this with boyfriend because I felt weird about it and at first I thought there was nothing to it and that my interest in them would certainly pass soon. But it didn\u2019t. It\u2019s now more than half a year later and I\u2019m a huge fan. My boyfriend still has no idea. I just don\u2019t know how to bring it up. If you're wondering how it's possible that I spend so much time on BTS without him knowing: I mostly spend my time alone at home (I only work 2 days a week and have online classes) while he's at work.\n\nAs you can imagine, he never liked pop or anything else that could be considered mainstream, so I\u2019m a little scared that he would judge me. I mean before I knew anything about BTS, I also judged people that were into Kpop (I now realize that was wrong). So I would understand that reaction because I was like that too.\n\nYeah\u2026. Has anyone ever had a similar problem and how did you deal with it? How did you overcome it? How do I bring it up?"

Capital O OBSESSED. \nShe's a personal trainer and coach so she does know a lot about calories and food, but the way she uses that us so unhealthy. \n\nFor example:\n\n- I wasn't allowed to eat any sweets, desert, junk food etc. until I was well into elementary school. Fruit where what I ate as candy. \n\n- She followed a ton of different diets and made me follow them too. She just cooked in her diet style and fed me exactly that. That wouldn't be bad if her diets weren't restrictive and weird. \n\n- I was always too skinny or too fat. So my body naturally runs on the skinny to underweight side, but that's normal for me and I can't change that without extreme effort. \nShe kept commenting on that. First it was \"oh you are so lucky you are skinny, I would kill for that body.\" then it turned into \"you are too skinny, you need to gain weight\" and when I finally gained weight it turned into \"you really need to watch what you're eating, you're getting a little fat around the butt\". I still was underweight when she called me fat btw. I just gained 4 kg getting me from super underweight to slightly underweight. \n\n- every time I ate anything she commented on it listing calories, nutrients etc. I never had an eating disorder, but she got me really close to having one. She even encouraged me to calorie count and loose weight that way. At like 14-16. \n\n- Every time she saw a fat person, or even just a slightly chubby person she commented on that. She would absolutely tear into them behind their backs, telling me how disgusting being fat is and how being overweight is worst thing you could possibly be. \nShe would literally make a gagging sound and say things like \"I have to puke, look how ugly/disgusting that 'insert insult against overweight people here' person is\"\nShe'd even fat shame my friends and she's still calling my boyfriend fat/ugly/lazy every time I see her because he's chubby. \n\n- she micro managed my appearance at every turn. If I wasn't wearing something she bought or she liked she'd comment on that until I changed. \nIt was so bad that I basically placed dress most of my life. \n\nAll of that gave me an extremely unhealthy few of myself. I am a naturally happy person, but her constant nagging and criticism of my body and appearance made me super uncomfortable in my own skin. \nI still feel fat if I gain even a few grams, I still think my ass is too fat and my thighs too chubby. The slightest sign of fat on my stomach makes me feel ugly. Even tho I know that's not right. I am still super underweight. I could gain 10kg and I would still be skinny. \nBut at the same time I hate being skinny. I hate my scrawny arms and tiny shoulders, I hate how fragile I look and how little I can lift. Basically everything my Mum commented on when I was a kid I hate about myself. \nRecently I have started trying to gain muscle and weight by working out and eating more calories, but that had led my Mum to comment on my weight even more because she wants to \"help\". \n\nI should add that she has recently started developing very obvious anorexia and it's worrying me a little bit, but I can't change her and I honestly don't give a shit about what she does with her body anymore. \n\nI am low contact and told her off multiple times, no contact isn't an option. It's annoying, but I am dealing with it better every day. \n\nDid anyone elses Mum act like that or is that a special her thing?"

Joint pains get so bad I can't even work without crutches, all my gains are lost. \n\nAnd that's if I manage to get a routine going because of course ADHD and depression make that almost impossible.

                "body": "I'll get right to the point. My grandfather's line of the family has always been a mystery, as I had almost no contact with him growing up, and there is nobody left alive to ask about it. I know his name, I've seen his marriage/divorce records (there are two), I've seen his WWII draft registration card, and the only census record is from after his marriage to my grandmother. I've tried to find records of his parents, but it's almost as if they never existed. Here's what keeps it confusing, (and I will be using completely fake, generic names for the sake of privacy right now):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* First of all, I feel it is important to note that even though I will be using a generic name, my grandfather's last name is very unique. It's not spelled oddly or anything, you just never hear this name. You would think that would make it easier to find records about him, or about his parents, or something. It does not.\n* My grandfather was born in the early 1920s, and was adopted at a young age by relatives (I think an aunt/uncle). To my knowledge, he had no biological siblings. If he did, we never heard, but I am suspicious that he might have. I just can't prove it.\n* My grandfather got married twice. On one marriage certificate, his parents are listed as \"John Smith, Sr.\" and \"Jane Smith.\" On another marriage certificate, however, it is \"Samuel Smith\" and \"Mary Smith.\" (They all had the same last name). It would then make sense to me that one set of parents would be his biological parents, and the other would be his aunt/uncle. However, I'm not 100% sure who is who. (Side note: The women actually had their maiden names listed in these records, and I've tried looking them up under those names as well, but no success). \n* Related to this, I found a wedding announcement from my grandfather's marriage to my grandmother. The announcement states that his parents, \"Samuel Smith and Mary Smith\" were both deceased. Since my grandfather was named \"John Smith, Jr.,\" I have to assume that either the aunt/uncle who raised him had also died by this point, and that they were \"Samuel and Mary\" ***or*** I have to assume that the aunt/uncle were \"John and Jane,\" and changed his name upon adoption. I think the first possibility is more likely, but you never know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI quite literally can find next to nothing that allows me to confirm that any of these people ever existed. All I have to go off of are the names in a marriage announcement, and the names in a couple of marriage records. That's it. They never appear anywhere else at all, and while I am positive that my grandfather would lie without hesitation about anything and everything, I don't know that you could fake these names like that (Right?!). I'm at a loss of what the next steps might be under these circumstances. \n\n\nDoes anyone have advice? Tips and tricks? I've been losing my mind here for several years now!\n\nEDIT: Answering a few questions that keep coming up (and fixed a few things above). \n\n\u2022I have used Ancestry, FamilySearch, Newspapers, 23andMe, FindAGrave, etc. for DNA and records. Nothing of use comes up. Not even census info beyond a record from the 1950s. \n\n\u2022I do not have any close DNA matches beyond my paternal grandma's side of things and my mom's family. \n\n\u2022His surname is English already, spelled very simply, just not a name you hear much at all (I have the same name). There is an S at the end of it, I've tried finding him without the S, taking out some letters, etc. Nothing.\n\n\u2022He had no obituary and no funeral. I didn't even know he died until a year after the fact, and my uncle handled everything. My uncle was estranged, and has also since passed away, which I only know because my siblings and I were next of kin."

Occasionally you'll stay late in order to work a shift change group, or to finish paperwork for a case you caught. For the most part once you off duty you can leave work at work. Many agents will actually go their entire careers without ever going to court. One thing to note is FOB Camps and processing mandates. If you go to a station with an FOB camp, you may get mandated to go for a week if they can't fill slots (kinda rare). You may also end up getting mandated to travel to some of the areas were many of the asylees are crossing in mass. You'll be there for a month processing. Again it likely won't happen often but coming in you'll be first on the list if no one volunteers.",

I have gone so far as to call JEGS and get a quote/part number on a cam with the low to mid range torque that I want for my engine. Looks like I'll just have to get new valve springs.

Is this true?\n\nWhat may I be missing? I have a Haynes manual.

What does that even mean?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transracial_(identity)\n\n> Why should the Japanese government allow that?\n\nI do assume you agree with the fact that you are what you identify as? By law someone who has Japanese parents, are granted Japanese citizenship, even when born in another country. When you identify as Japanese who your parents are shouldn't matter. In the same way, if you identify as a cat, it shouldn't matter if your parents are human. I mean - genetics play no part here whatsoever. If anyone went with genetics then no genetically male would be allowed in female sports.. So genetics is really of no importance in these matters. \n\nAnd for the record - I'm not making up identifying as a cat: https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/a-student-identifies-as-a-cat-how-stunning-and-brave\n\n> I meant absolutely, but you have to compete and follow the rules like anyone else, which means qualifying.\n\nWell, that is not allowing a single biological female to participate in professional male sports - so those rules obviously needs to change. \n\n> Why do you identify as a child? What do you mean when you say you identify that way?\n\nI feel a deep inner sense of being a child. \n\n> Do you believe the differences between males and females are the same as, or even comparable to, the differences between adults and children?\n\nSure. If a biological human can identify as a cat, I see no problems with adults identifying as children. An adult human and child human are much closer genetically compared to a biological human and biological cat. \n\nAnd why would any differences even matter?\n\n> Also, do you believe that anyone who generally supports trans women playing in women's sports must automatically support having zero guidelines in place whatsoever to ensure fairness?\n\nIm pretty sure that most trans-men find todays arrangement extremely unfair.",

My base right now is around 35 miles per week with a fair amount of cross training, backpacking, and some strength training. My plan was to build this up over the next 11 weeks, including a few back to back long runs and a marathon a few weeks before the race.\n\nI've seen shin splints take people out for months, and I'm prepared to RICE and swim (\\~2500 yds a session) for the next two weeks or so. I *really* can't have this turn into a stress fracture. \n\nHow should I go about my training after this?

It seems to be expressed when the person is either very comfortable or feeling socially superior to others. The conversation is usually energetic and rolling, with the guy showing off his charm and charisma. Sometimes a guy will say something slightly raunchy or controversial followed by this fit of laughter, and then be able to immediately stop and say something deadpan.\n\nHere's an example (this comedian does it a lot):\n\n[Andrew Schulz at 5:29](https://youtu.be/KdlawuL19U4?t=329)\n\n[Another](https://youtu.be/LhaUu0Jnb9s?t=164)\n\nI've practically only seen this in men, and I'm a woman, so I'm not entirely sure if this is a genuine expression or something that only appears in particular settings.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone here follows cognitive functions, but I'm pretty sure I've seen this behavior in males ESTPs and potentially ENTPs, making me think it has something to do with tertiary Fe or Fe in general. I've actually witnessed it most often in younger guys, like early 20s, who have an impulsive yet charming type of personality. \n\nCan anyone offer any more analysis? When and in what type of people does this behavior occur?"

Me, my younger sis, and my older sis were all sitting around in some house reminiscing about the past. Suddenly we were asleep then we woke up to the sound of a very loud boom.

Not normal men. Sure, you can be attracted to people younger than you - but actively seeking them out is different.\n\nWomen don't care about height nearly as much as men think they do.\n\nAttractiveness is largely societal. If you're taught to find a trait attractive by those around you, you will as an adult. Attractiveness can also change and be unlearned. \n\nI'm begging reddit people to stop getting their information about women and biology from other isolated dudes on reddit.\n\nThis post was about giving advice to young women. \"You're only valuable in your 20s so find a good man and settle down\" is what it boils down to, which is\nA. Terrible for women's mental health and financial future.\nB. Already what women were doing for decades that made them miserable.",

But ideally it's 25- early 30s because that's when the body/pelvis is fully developed. Also, the idea that pregnancy after 35 is high risk and geriatric is also medically outdated. It heavily depends on your genetics and health. Many women's fertility *increases* in their 30s.\n\nSame goes for men btw. Sperm quality decreases as you age and peaks from 25-30 years old. \n\nWe understand the body so much less than people think we do. Also having kids doesn't make you valuable lol.",

I'm worried that it'll never go away even with treatment. \n\nIve had these symptoms for a year, but they've been getting much worse lately. I pretty much have acid in my throat 24/7 and my throat has been sore for 3 days. I know that that can cause permanent vocal scarring. Is there anyone here who's also a singer? Got any tips?

Don't eat anything.\n\nLast night I got diagnosed and just found out this condition isn't reversible. I can't stop crying. I'm only in my early 20s and I have to live the rest of my life like this. They said my antidepressants caused this. Its...not fair? I thought the medication would make my life easier but it just made it so much harder. \n\nI've struggled with food and weight my entire life. Now my hair is falling out, I'm getting horrible dark circles and wrinkles, I'm constantly exhausted. Am I going to die early? I'm about to become a professional singer and singing is almost impossible now that I'm sick all the time.\nMy life was just looking up but the fact that I just.

The texture doesn't look good if it isn't straightened, but my hair can't hold a hairstyle overnight. It gets tangled veryy easily, brushing it is difficult, and in the morning, I wake up w a nest on my head (that brushing only makes worse bc of the poofing).\n\nI got a keratin straightening treatment in March last year, but it didn't help, and it caused hair loss and hair thinning. It's also made my scalp greasier than it was before.\n\nI dont do the CG method bc my hair is too fine and porous for it. I just use shampoo and condition it except the roots every 1-3 days. I rotate between shampoos, usually Pantene or chihtsai, maybe head and shoulders sometimes.\n\nWashing and straightening it every day just isn't possible. How do I salvage my hair?"

But when compared to the rest of Muse\u2019s discography  this is easily their weakest project. For starters, I\u2019m really not a fan of the production on this album. It sounds almost too clean and over polished, it feels sterile. Secondly, there aren\u2019t that many highlights on this album. Every other muse album has at least a few songs that I would consider top-tier muse, but WOTP doesn\u2019t really have any except Kill Or Be Killed. Aside from that song, the rest of the album is just incredibly mediocre and generic. On top of that it has some of the worst Muse songs to date. The title track Will Of The People sounds like a truck commercial, We Are Fucking Fucked has good verses but an incredibly annoying chorus, and Liberation feels like the band is trying way too hard to go for that Queen-esque sound they were going for on Resistance and 2nd Law. Overall not a bad album, just very mediocre and easily Muse\u2019s worst album in my opinion. What are your thoughts?"

During 2020-2022, this had to stop, so Brandon had days with nothing to do.

So when a black NBA player calls a white player \"whiteboy\" in a derogatory context in the middle of a playoff game, to enforce the current standard we as a country are trying to set, we need to appropriately act on this. While the NBA might be cool with letting him apologize, and Luka may have accepted the apology, Harrell should be suspended due to his unnecessary words in a professional setting. I heard the TNT commentary crew (Shaq, Ernie, Barkley) let him use the excuse that \"It was the heat of the moment\" as if they were letting him off with an excuse like that? A lot of people do and say dumb stuff in the heat of the moment, but it doesn't excuse them from their actions. If a hard stance isn't taken on either side, then the whole equality movement holds no bearing in terms of fairness."

He was definitely depressed for a few weeks there: he had terrible separation anxiety and would whine and cry if I ever left the apartment even to run to my car, he would growl at my roommates, he always wants to go outside but would also resist being out on leash. He misses his sisters, my parents, my sister and being able to go outside whenever he wants, so I get that I\u2019m not only his owner but also his last remnant of his old home. And while the separation anxiety has improved a ton and he\u2019s warmed up to my roommates, he still gets too excited to see me when I come home. I usually ignore him until he calms down but it always takes awhile. Idk it just makes me sad that I\u2019m his only source of happiness and it\u2019s kind of turning into resentment. Even when I yell at him for chewing up something, or for digging into the trash can, he always responds by cozying up to me, almost apologetically. Like why can\u2019t he tone it down a bit? Why can\u2019t he be on his own a little more. He has other people home with him and he still sees my family when they dog sit on nights that I work. But I come home he\u2019s jumping a foot in the air and crying to greet me and never leaves my side for more than a couple minutes when I\u2019m home. I wish he was more independent. I wish he didn\u2019t love me so much. Should I talk to a vet or get a trainer? \nI know how emotionally dead I sound, but I really need to get these thoughts out into the open so I can deal with them."

For the past 5 days he has been adjusting very poorly and issues I had with him before have been getting worse and I'm nearly at the end of my rope.\n\nTo start, he has pretty bad separation anxiety. I was previously living with my parents, my younger sister and our two other dogs who he got along with okay (they find him to be kind of annoying). Previously, there would always be someone home with him as I would work nights and the rest of my family would be home right after I would leave for work. I left one morning for about an hour and a half and I could hear him yapping when I left as well as when I came back. Hell even this morning, I brought him to a family Easter brunch and he started freaking out and trying to pull toward me when I handed the leash to a family member when I went across the room to serve myself a plate.\n\nNext, he hasn't been handling new people very well, in general recently his resource guarding has become worse. Back when I was living at home he started growling at my dad for coming into my bedroom and my sister for sitting down on the couch next to me. My dad nipped this in the bud but he still has this issue with other people, I tell people to impose themselves on him and stare him down which has had mixed success. This again has gotten worse since the move; today, he snapped at my roommate for picking up something that was close to him. This, obviously, isn't acceptable.\n\nHe has always been afraid of the car since seeing the windshield wipers on, and while he has been better about not trying to hop in my lap while in the car, he still tries to pull away as we approach the car. He's also been pulling on walks, which he never used to do before (this is to be expected as he's in a brand new environment),\n\nOverall, he's been a lot more disobedient about normal commands like sit, down, bed and kennel.\n\nAll of this is made worse by the fact that he doesn't seem to care as much about treats, I just got him two new kinds of treats while he refuses to eat one outright unless I break it in half, he seems to really like the other. BUT, as soon as my roommate tried giving him a treat he seemed a lot less interested and now he's not as interested in receiving them from me either.\n\nI already have a lot of ideas, but I want to get other opinions first, I want to get him back on track. He seems sad and I want him to adjust as well as possible to his new home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Eskinu adjusting poorly after move: freaks out if I leave the apartment for even a minute, has been growling/resource guarding me and my bedroom, not really interested in treats anymore. I'm scared he might be depressed."

Also, performing any percent-based calculations on 0\u00b0C will give you a different answer than 0\u00b0F.\n\nBut there IS a unit of measurement for temperature that takes this into account. It's called the Kelvin scale, and zero degrees of temperature in this scale (0\u00b0K) represents a literal absence of all heat energy. Because it starts at zero energy, you can takes multiples or fractions of Kelvin temperatures. So that means that half of the sun's surface temperature is half of 5,778\u00b0K (2,889\u00b0K). This translates to about 2,615\u00b0C or 4,740\u00b0F. \n\nSo how come the Earth's temperature doesn't reach these kinds of temperature? The best answer is distance. The sun's energy has to travel a tremendous distance before is reaches us. It radiates outward away from the sun in an ever-expanding sphere of light and heat. The reason that not enough of it hits the Earth to heat us into the thousands of degrees is the same reason that you would hold a glass right under the showerhead rather than near the bottom of the tub if you wanted to fill it quickly.",

That put me off the pairing completely, he treated his other love interests (like Eva and Raina) much better than he ever did Blair. I can justify a toxic pairing as long as it feels like they do truly care about each other, but it didn\u2019t feel like that to me.",

                "body": "TLDR: my MacBook will not boot after suffering water damage.  It was suffering software issues prior to that.  I already planned to upgrade in the next two years.  Apple wants $400 for just the hardware repair.  Can I fix this myself, should I send it to Apple, or should I just buy a new MacBook?\n\n\nLast week I spilled half a glass of water on my desk.  I thought I had scooped up my 2013 MacBook Pro in time, but it now refuses to turn on or even charge.  When I opened the cover, I found water around the battery, next to the corner of the laptop with the power level indicator.  Is this something that I could relatively easily and affordably fix myself? Is it likely that only the battery is damaged?\n\nFor a month prior to this, the computer was also having software issues.  Mail crashes frequently, citing \"network issues.\". Simultaneously, I have issues with Office.  If I try to open a file in Excel or Word, I receive an error message that the file path cannot be found.  If I try to save an already opened document, the error message states that computer does not have enough memory (despite having a bounty of free memory available).  Certain websites stop working as well.  Facebook will not load.  Reddit will load, bit I cannot open posts or upvote.  YouTube seems to be the only site that works without issue.  If I hold down the power button and restart the computer, it will sometimes return back to its normal state for 5 minutes to 5 hours, but it inevitably crashes again.\n\nI've had the computer for at least 5 years and I was already planning to replace it in a year or two.  Right now is not the best time financially, but these issues may force my hand.  Apple wants $400 just to fix the hardware issue.  That seems poor value if the software issue persists and I just replace the device in a year anyway.\n\nCan I fix this issue enough to get another year or two out of the laptop?  Should I just purchase a replacement now?  If I purchase a replacement, can I move files from the hard drive on a dead computer to my new one?  Thank you for your help and advice."

Even teams in ligue 1 have spent $80M more in total than la liga (Ligue 1 spent 375M). The prem has spent 1.33B compared to la liga\u2019s 295M. \ud83d\ude33 \n\nApparently it stems from covid. While the other leagues loosened their ffp rules to help support the clubs, la liga kept their strict ffp rules the same. This has shown in la liga clubs\u2019s performances in europe. Barca and sevilla in uel and atletico not even qualifying for uel\u2026 Not to mention real betis and almeria having similar struggles as barca and la liga teams in general not spending much at all. \n\nKeeping the rules the same isn\u2019t that big of a deal for me, but they see how much la liga is falling behind and they still don\u2019t do much to help the clubs? Teams in other leagues can pump in money from oil or rich owners, while la liga is left to be fucked? And we\u2019re still getting a thorn in our side trying to renew Gavi while Chelsea\u2019s pulling money out of their ass to sign Enzo Fernandez\u2026 Either la liga\u2019s rules need to loosen up or the other leagues need to become stricter. \n\nTo me it feels like madrid bias\u2026 Imagine real madrid didn\u2019t qualify for ucl knockouts this season and were relegated to uel along with barca and sevilla. Would la liga still have a stick up their ass about FFP rules or would they become more lenient? I honestly think they\u2019d become more lenient. From the boards point of view, it seems like the rest of la liga can get fucked so long as madrid is doing ok. \ud83d\ude44"

I haven\u2019t been too impressed with Shivering or anything released after that\u2026 the drops and build-ups sound half baked and they don\u2019t have the same emotion. \n\nEven From The Ashes, which is most similar to his original style (and is still a good song), sounds like the drop could\u2019ve had so much more, but he held back because Skylar Grey had vocals on it and he wanted to accommodate for her in order to have a bigger audience. Even though lots of people like Good Things Fall Apart, I think it\u2019s a bit overrated and sounds a bit too \u201cpop-y\u201d and mainstream. A fair amount of Fallen Embers has a similar vibe. \n\nSame thing with Don\u2019t Let Me Let Go, All That Really Matters, and Worst Day. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoy them all and I think they\u2019re good songs, I just hope they\u2019re not the main songs of his next album and he doesn\u2019t hold his original expression back on the majority of the tracks. There\u2019s plenty of us who still really like his OG music even if he\u2019s trying to appeal to a more mainstream audience\u2026 Of his recent music, Sideways and Nightlight are by far the best. \n\nAnd even if he\u2019s just releasing what he enjoys, then that\u2019s great for him, but I just can\u2019t help noticing the stark contrast from his older music\u2026It doesn\u2019t feel the same anymore."

USEast servers give me the best connection and I sometimes have to wait in a queue just to farm some pots. For such a large part of the game, trading is very unorganized and inefficient. \n\nThey should make trading servers, separate from realm-grinding servers, to get rid of wait time and give trading some efficiency. They should be called \u201ctrading markets\u201d or \u201ctrading hubs.\u201d Each server with its own corresponding hub and increased player capacity. (A MUCH greater player capacity). If I want to trade something, I\u2019d know exactly where to go. \n\nThere would be no realm portals to enter, so the players who need to trade can purely focus on trading, and the players who want to play can go into the normal servers. (There wouldn\u2019t be any teleportation wait time switching to and from a server and its corresponding hub). Perhaps teleportation wait time could also be removed to/from any server\u2019s trading hub. \n\nThe current trading server can change at any given time, and the entire trading system in realm just feels \u2018sloppy.\u2019 (For lack of a better term.)\n\nMaybe this would also increase the amount of active realms in each server. There\u2019s a high concentration of players grinding dungeons in the crowded trading servers, even though it\u2019s not their best connection, because they don\u2019t want to wait again in the queue for when they want to return to trading. If there was a separate trading hub for each server, I think the player population would be spread out. Better to have that than 2 realms in USMidWest with 20 players max, while 5 realms in USEast have 85/85 players with a 14 player waiting queue each. \n\nAnd if people end up congregating to one crowded trading server anyway, at least they won\u2019t get in the way of people just trying to grind dungeons. Maybe another idea is to have all the tradeable items lined up in the hub, where people can find and create buying/selling offers like on realmeye. If someone is interested in an offer, they can click a button and then you get a notification."

Fuck me sideways.\n\nEx2 This is a new one, and I've only encountered this at the Boba shop called ShareTea, which is a chain in the U.S. The \"milk\" in most of their drinks contains whey, but this milk is labeled \"non-dairy\". Guys. The \"non-dairy\" milk contains whey. Fucking how? It also contains palm oil. What the fuck? ShareTea is the only place where I've seen this, and I'm glad I asked the woman working there if I could see the ingredient list. She literally told me that she didn't know that whey comes from milk. I don't really care that she didn't know...a lot of people don't know basic stuff about food, I don't hold it against her personally. But she didn't label this stuff non-dairy, that's on corporate, and I do blame them.\n\nSo, at least if you're in the U.S., please remember that \"non-dairy\" items may actually contain milk ingredients, and that's somehow allowed for some goddamn reason."

Here's my summarized story:\n\nAround 6 and half years ago I was the popular pretty girl in my school (which may sound like a joke, or even fairness to most people), some stuff happened and I ended up having a step brother and two stepsisters, this boy (who was 13 at the time, and I was 8/9) hated me, I believe he was jealous due to the fact that I spent more time with his father than he did, so he started bullying, called me fat, ugly, whale, all of that, he even used to hit me, and within time I started believing it, it got into my head, I started hating the way I looked, I hated myself, at 10 I already wanted to kill myself, this boy tortured me for years and years, until he wasn't my stepbrother anymore. As it all got into my head my beauty started fading, the happy extroverted confident girl was looong gone (puberty also didn't help), and I became exactly what he called me: a fat ugly girl.\n\nYears passed, my depression and social anxiety are mostly gone (I only see it now how many mental health issues I had), but all of those things never got out of my head, they are subconcious now. It's not even in the back of my mind, it is my mind. \n\nNow I finally realised that I can be that girl again, I can be pretty again, I can finally after all these years be confident enough to act like myself, I just need one little push, to my mind, losing weight would be the solution, but I doubt those mean things will get out of my head. \n\nHow do I get over it?"

We also saw it in English class and I'm in Germany so I think it must've been pretty popular at that time. \nGrateful for all replies!"

I applied tirelessly all summer trying to escape my toxic job and kept complaining almost every day about how drained I was, how bad the culture was, etc. The truth is, life reflects to you where you\u2019re at internally. Not to punish but for reference (in my opinion).\n\nPresence, peace, happiness, and everything else comes from within first. I realized I needed to find happiness where I was at and allow my higher self/spirit guides/god (or whatever you call it) show me the way. I started saying \u201cit\u2019s ok I\u2019m at this job, because I\u2019ll be at the right one soon\u201d. I kid you not, a week-ish later a recruiter reached out to me via LinkedIn and long story short, I\u2019m at that company now. The culture is amazing, pay is much better, and everything else is perfect. Many of my new colleagues are spiritual as well. It\u2019s nice for my creative mind and my desire to start a family soon. I also  have never felt so aligned in my life. This was the easiest job I\u2019ve ever gotten. I felt like I didn\u2019t need to try at all. I did not even fill out an application. \n\nSometimes we get lost in the 3D (I definitely did), but allowing our true nature to guide us is the easiest way to go about it. At least in my opinion or experience. Try to release control and be guided to where you need to be, you won\u2019t be disappointed :)",

Years were spent apart and wondering how they were doing and wishing we were the typical loving family you see on TV. \n\nAfter I discovered Neville, particularly the stories about the woman who changed her perception of her boss to praise her and the grandmother who did SATS to be able to be in contact with her grandchildren, I decided to try it out on my estranged family. \n\nIt took a bit of revision and persistence, but it unfolded so naturally. We are so close now and it feels like we\u2019ve always been on great terms. It feels weird to  remember the bad times but that\u2019s how it goes in the manifesting world :) \n\nBasically, I\u2019m saying to focus on the relationship you want. It can suck to have memories of a negative past, but if you\u2019re willing to let it go to get a new future where it\u2019s like the negative stuff never happened, simply fantasize about how you want it to be and feel it real as Neville says. This can apply to any type of relationship, not just familial. \n\nI would begin with gratitude\u2014 what do you like about said person? What are you grateful for in regards to them? What makes them valuable in your life? Remember that you are equal to them, they are not above you! Self love is so important. If you need to, note how you are important to them. \n\nEventually you\u2019ll be able to think positively about them naturally and do SATS with ease (btw it doesn\u2019t have to be at night before bed in my opinion). \n\nAnyway, I hope this helps you all who were interested. I tried to explain the process without rambling on too long (I hope! Lol). Good luck my friends \ud83d\udc9b"

My career is taking off and I anticipate major bumps in pay (why I believed it was possible). \n\nSo I began the process and naturally imagined what size, color, etc. of boat I want. My logical mind had identified a bridge of incidents and a basic time frame (sometimes I forget circumstances don\u2019t matter). \n\nRegardless, I was excited and had zero doubt I\u2019d get my boat eventually. Well, turns out my SP and a few of my family members are getting me one as a gift. The funny thing is, I only mentioned once I wanted a boat someday a while ago. I never thought they\u2019d gift me one. Also, I used to have a horrible relationship with my family members (that\u2019s a whole other success story lol). \n\nBottom line, anything is possible.

However, given the world events I said to myself the right opportunity will fall into my lap and I won\u2019t actively search right now. Around the same time I decided I wanted a new job, I was looking up places around the world I wanted to visit in the future and felt excited about it. In my mind, the new job and traveling were separate desires. \n\nSomeone I know who works in the same industry as me randomly reached out saying he thinks I would fit in perfect at his company. I spoke with some people and found out the position would include travel to some places I\u2019ve always wanted to visit. I got really excited but thought that I\u2019d love a similar opportunity at my current company because I have over a month and a half paid time off banked up (I know I can just create it again, but this was my human thought lol). Anyway, a few days later someone who I networked with a few years ago who I haven\u2019t spoke to since, reached out saying her department has an opening that was just approved to be filled that day and she thinks I\u2019d be a perfect fit.

[Here is an audiobook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8Nd8SgGero) if you don't want to read it lol. When I first read At Your Command, the law really clicked for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Man has placed too little value upon himself. In the Book of Numbers you will read, \u201cIn that day there were giants in the land; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers. And we were in their sight as grasshoppers.\u201d This does not mean a time in the dim past when man had the stature of giants. Today is the day, the eternal now when conditions roundabout you have attained the appearance of giants (such as unemployed, the armies of your enemy, your problems and all things that seem to threaten you) those are the giant that make you feel yourself to be a grasshopper. But, you are told, you were first, in your own sight a grasshopper and because of this you were to the giants \u2013 a grasshopper. In other words, ***you can only be to others what you are first to yourself***. Therefore, to revalue yourself and *begin to feel yourself to be the giant, a center of power, is to dwarf these former giants and make of them grasshoppers*. \u201c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That is; you cannot take with you into the new consciousness any part of the old man. *All of your present beliefs, fears and limitations are weights that bind you to your present level of consciousness.* If you would transcend this level you must leave behind all that is now your present self, or conception of yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Your desires contain within themselves the plan of self-expression. *So leave all judgments out of the picture and rise in consciousness to the level of your desire and make yourself one with it by* ***claiming it to be so now***. For: \u201cMy grace is sufficient for thee. My strength is made perfect in weakness.\u201d *Have faith in this unseen claim until the conviction is born within you that it is so*. Your confidence in this claim will pay great rewards. Just a little while and he, the thing desired, will come. But without faith it is impossible to realize anything. Through faith the worlds were framed because \u201cfaith is the substance of the thing hoped for \u2013 the evidence of the thing not yet seen.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Every state that you have ever recognized, you have embodied. That which you are recognizing as true of yourself today is that which you are experiencing. So be as the widow and recognize joy, no matter how little the beginnings of recognition, and you will be generously rewarded \u2013 for ***the world is a magnified mirror, magnifying everything that you are conscious of being***."

But everything is going to be determined by what you want in life.

There\u2019s not a worse feeling in the world then doing something you hate just because of the benefits. If you have to go back to college later in life, because it finally means something to you, I would say that\u2019s worth better than just giving half-assed effort and feeling like what you doing now doesn\u2019t matter. But you also have to accept whatever consequences comes with that. So again, you can choose to stay in college and do entrepreneurship on the side, or just pursue it now full time. It\u2019s your choice. Don\u2019t let people try to dissuade you from your dreams with fear, but also be realistic as well.

I only have 6 months left until my current contract ends. I was wondering, if any other servicemembers would mind commenting as well, if now would be a good time to apply to my local union? I understand there is a long wait time which could possibly last up to a year or more. I do not have any experience in the electrical field whatsoever. But, I have been interested in working with working my hands vice versa being in an office environment. I understand that being in a trade would require to working in dirty and hazardous conditions, as well as putting a lot of physical strain on my body. Luckily (or not), the Marine Corps has prepared for me those type of conditions, so I can easily adapt to any new situations. I am also willing to work hard to learn the knowledge needed to become a good electrician. Also, I am aware the Marine Corps has a program where you can do an apprenticeship on the last 6 months of your contract with the approval of your supervisors. Due to my current situation, I will not be able to do that at the moment, unless I extend my contract which is something I'm hesitant to do. Basically, what I am asking is, if anyone can help facilitate the process of me transitioning out of the Marine Corps into an apprenticeship so that I can transition with little to no issues. I am stationed at Quantico, which is in Virginia, although I do live near Southern Maryland. I would appreciate any advice someone can give to me. Thanks."

Are there Do's and Dont's when creating a layout? I am trying to come up with designs for maps that are fun to play and look somewhat realistic in placement of assets, like having buildings and forests not just placed on an empty canvas, rather as an actual settlement... but its really hard to predict how balanced it turns out.\n\nAny input is appreciated."

Don\u2019t go too far too fast on a whim because then you\u2019re that much more likely to redose on a whim.  \n\nI just waited until Mondays to lower my dose, then had 7 days at 25% less. There\u2019s been some rough days in there but overall it\u2019s been manageable. I didn\u2019t deviate and now I\u2019m hopping off at 0.5g. \n\nGrab some supplements, Liposomal vitamin C and black seed oil. Maybe some DLPA as well. God speed",

I can see a bundle for WC1 & 2 on GoG, is it what I want ? But mostly, do I buy Warcraft III Classic or Reforged or is there another version I should take?"

Couldn't we convert binaries to 64-bit by disassembling them, changing the instructions to their 64-bit equivalent, then reassembling them?

It's honestly making me depressed and sad and is reverting me back to how I acted in the final months of my last relationship when I was 19 (I'm 25 now) I don't want to hurt him but i can't help it when my head is making me want to hate him, it's making me down and I don't want to hurt him. Sorry if I sound like a crazy bitch. I'm honestly just so depressed and anxious about everything, it makes me sick when I think like that or when I know he's about with other people and out speaking to me."

I stopped taking the pill about 19 after breaking up with my ex and since then other than taking it briefly at the age of 22 for a medical reason haven't taken them until now. I've recently started again due to starting a new relationship and I'm concerned on side effects. Other that growing horrid facial hair I would say I have a decent quality of life. I'm lean, anxiety has been managed for a good several months, decent skin on the face and such, I take vit D and magnesium. I've read about the side effects and I would say I'm fairly concerned about them, I'm on rigevidon currently, any experience or advice. I am going to be taking a blood test soon to determine if I actually have PCOS, but not to sound ignorant, I'm pretty convinced. Sorry if I have left any details out, but any advice would be cool, thanks!"

First of all about 2 weeks ago I started getting an anxiety attack around my arms, back, chest neck throat ( felt like a heart attack, had a similar experience over winter for about a month and a bit), this could contribute into several factors since I've just finished uni, I have negative association when it comes to my home town and I've suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember. \n\nI went the docs, they said it was anxiety but just to make sure they would do further blood tests (I had blood tests in Jan again just to check and everything was clear in the major organs) and with this I found out I was d deficient. About several days ago I noticed my correlation in stopping weed and these symptoms and came the the conclusion I was suffering from weed withdrawal after looking at r/leaves. since this happened in winter too but I didn't put two and two together ( because I'm stubborn) .\n\nMy alcohol consumption is weird, like I don't drink everyday as some days I'd smoke weed instead and consumption could range from a couple of beers to like a whole mini pack of them in a day depending or a bottle of wine, like it spends if we were socializing or just chilling really. Consumption of it gets blurry at home as my parents offer me wine and I can get blasted on that shit tbh. Recently I've been drinking more because 2 weeks ago it was my birthday so I was drinking nearly every night back home, first couple of days especially, I think it's because I was feeling like shit as well so that didn't help.\n\nI didn't drink yesterday (because I couldn't due to reasons) but drunk a bottle wine and one or two more glasses of stuff the night previous because I thought my friend was going to come over. Ever since ending of uni I will some times have a cheeky drink or brewski on the odd days like mainly at midday...\n\n...the point is I was thinking about this and because of everything going on I was looking at withdrawal symptoms and was scared if I'd go through them. I'm a 23 F and I'm hoping to drink a lot less when I leave but I'm scared if I'm an alcoholic.  I get in my head about alot of things and worriedly told my dad but I just don't want to become miserable and leading a unhealthy lifestyle. I'm already wanting to not touch weed again, what should I do about the alcohol.\n\nI'll let you know I normally tend to drink beers, Coors lite and bud lite mainly... I know I may be worrying and it might just be a faze I will get over. Like I do want a drink atm but I don't want to get blasted.\n\nSorry if this is all over the place, I can be a bit of a worry sport and a hyperchondriac but I want to lead a responsible lifestyle and I just don't want to disappoint or die because I did this to myself..."

This case remains in process for 2.5 months. \n\n2.5 months later, I receive notification that eBay is siding with the buyer, and will withdraw 815 from my account.

Better in a lot of ways, worse in some, but I can say without a doubt that quitting kratom has been nothing short of the best decision I could have made. \n\nSome benefits:\nI Lost 30lbs\n\nI have the energy to practice new sports like Jiu Jitsu\n\nI have the energy to spend time with friends\n\nI have the creativity to work on music\n\nI have the money to do fun things\n\nI have the ambition to peruse returning to school \n\nI have started going to therapy\n\nI was taking kratom and just letting life pass me by. Yeah it felt good for a while, but it drained my finances and hurt every relationship I had. There was a rough period after quitting. I\u2019m still going through the rough period to be honest. All of the emotional and physical problems I had before I started using didn\u2019t magically disappear. They all came back and I am still working through some of them, but I am working on them. It is always better to take half a step in the right direction than it is to passively remain in the same awful place. \n\nBeing off of kratom makes me confident that whatever growing and healing I need to undertake will get done. There is no way I would have been able to do anything for myself if I was still using. \n\nI want to thank everyone on this sub for their support throughout all of this. On days when I had cravings I would come back here. Coming here and talking to new quitters and trying to encourage them reinvigorated my own fortitude many times. I see myself in a lot of you, and I want you all to have the lives you deserve. Stay strong, it\u2019s worth it because you\u2019re worth it. \n\nWe\u2019re all gonna make it."

I have been watching porn and masturbating for a long time as a coping mechanism for sexual abuse trauma. Putting impulsive sexual behavior and addiction behind me is a necessity for healing. Though I\u2019ve limited myself to 2-3 times per week, down from daily, that\u2019s still too much. I have not stayed off porn and masturbation for more than a month at a time in a decade and a half.

We were both drained, so decided it would be best to end it amicably and give each other the space to grow and find ourselves. I\u2019m going to start therapy in two months to work out the issues I know contributed to the problem. She said she still loves and cares for me and wants to stay friends, but for the time being we are not going to maintain contact so that my reasons for perusing growth can remain specific to me. I told her once I\u2019m ready I would reach out to her and she accepted that. It\u2019s all still very fresh, I find myself crying sometimes when I think about it, but the fact that we ended on good terms makes it a little better. I am just trying to keep my eyes looking forward to help with the process. I\u2019ve started working out again, focusing on music, and have plans to begin a travel blog/vlog doing solo road trips on my motorcycle. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be ready to start dating again seriously, but looking forward implies I will begin dating again. I like to know what I\u2019m in for before I start things, so I\u2019m here.\n\nI had been in the relationship with my ex for almost the entirety of my adult life, we started out as friends and it transitioned into a relationship fairly quickly and suddenly with no real dating aspect to it. I honestly have no idea what I\u2019m supposed to do. \n\nI have downloaded tinder as a bit of a boost for my ego and I have gotten a few matches. If I choose to peruse something casual, what would that look like? \n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I work in sales so I am luckily not socially inept, but I am a total dumb-dumb when it comes to how to approach dating."

Beginner friendly \n\nWho: Me and hopefully you and three to four other people. I will dm but if anyone wants to try or learn they are more than welcome to. I got introduced to the game by being thrown into the dm seat and I haven't found my way out for the last three years. I'm not a big follower of rules and care more about the flow of the game and making sure everyone has a good time. \n\nWhat: Will probably start off with a few one shots to get the group comfortable and introduced to each other before moving into some longer style campaigns. I have ran dnd 5e and monster of the week in the past and am open to running other systems. I would say my dming style is lighthearted with some serious undertones and stories running underneath the jokes. I really enjoy creative players who help build the story just as much as I do. \n\nWhen: For me, preferably sunday afternoons to night but its not set in stone and we can move it around depending on people's schedules. \n\nWhere: In the beginning most likely a game store, Night owl games just reopened near me as an option. As we get closer to running a campaign hopefully we can move to a more private venue. \n\nWhy: I love ttrpg and I want to meet some cool new people :) I'm a fairly open book and if you have any questions ask away."

I understand not everything can be on equal footing but as close as we can get and throwing out stupid old biases is a great start.\n\nAs a woman who has been paid less for doing the exact same job, and who has always worked many hours and who has been praised multiple times in each company I work for... I can tell you it has nothing to do with performance. I currently work two jobs to make the same income as my friend who is in the same industry, similar resume, and company. In fact, his company is a struggling start-up on the brink of collapsing. Mine is not. I can't even get offers close to what he gets AND I am always a top candidate at each place I interview. Quite annoying.\n\nIt sucks because things like this keep us unequal. One close guy friend of mine has a dream to be a stay-at-home dad. However, that's a large ask when a mom can't bring in the same income her husband could, even when her job SHOULD bring in more income considering the industry she's in. If things were equal, the parent who wants to be a stay-at-home parent could do that and could do it comfortably. Also, erasing toxic masculinity would be great so that men could feel more comfortable with taking a higher role in parenting if they wish. Hell, my dad wished he could be a stay-at-home dad and I wish he could have but unfortunately he married my mom who was not well educated so... that's another story. Point is, I wish he had been able to do that, he was the better parent in my household by a long shot.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk. :D",

What sort of things do you feel you need from a girl?\n\nAs well as what kind of things do you think you want out of life in general? Are there things besides raising awareness, increased media exposure, cultural shift and being the best man you can be that will help your position in society, navigating masculinity as an Asian?\n\nThank you to anyone that answers my question. \nTake care of yourselves, guys."

                "body": "Sorry for bad grammar, I am writing this at midnight. There\u2019s no real point to this post, I just needed to write it. It\u2019s for myself. I\u2019m just vomiting up whatever comes to mind.\nI am reluctant to do this, but the only other person I ever feel comfortable venting too has already heard this spiel, and yet I still feel as though I need to tell someone about it, so here I am.\nTo start, I am fairly sure I have some conglomeration of depression, adhd, and an anxiety disorder. I am generally opposed to self diagnosis, but my parents have some problematic views on mental illness, and I just need to be able to give a name to the things I\u2019m feeling. Plus, I\u2019ve discussed with people who do have those things and they agree that I demonstrate the symptoms. Also, my family has a history of anxiety and adhd. Anyway, imma just go in chronological order of things I want to say, if that\u2019s ok with you.\nMy parents have argued as long as I can remember. According to them, their first big fight was on their first fucking date, so how they are still together is mind boggling. I also recently overheard that my dad has wanted to leave my mom since before I was a year old. When I was nine, my dad left for the first time. I recently reread some emails between us from when he was gone and we all thought they were getting divorced, and it made me really sad seeing my innocent little self having to go through this bullshit. I remember he left after, during an argument, my mom threw a wine glass at him. He told me to call the police, and the time it took me to walk to the nearest phone was the scariest few moments of my life. He told me to stop right as I was dialing the number and then left. My mom was a wreck for the next month and my siblings never left their rooms, leaving me to take care of myself (this would become a pattern). My mom even started dating other men, which is ironic, because the last time my dad left, he sent us a TikTok of some lady explaining some science thing, and she lost her goddamn mind and accused him of cheating because he was watching TikTok\u2019s of other women. She is the kind of person who doesn\u2019t believe a guy and girl can be friends without wanting to fuck and she doesn\u2019t allow my dad to even talk to, much less be friends with, any women. She also makes fun of me any time I talk about one of my female friends because she thinks we must be into each other. My dad leaving has become an annual tradition at this point, and each year I am more and more fascinated that they have not gotten divorced yet. \nI remember the second time he left was around the time of the 2016 election, and my mom made me (10 at the time) comfort her as she screamed and cried because Trump won. I get that he sucked, but why put that shit on me. Another time on the way to the lake to go boating, she yelled at me for wanting to listen to the guardian of the galaxy soundtrack, and then my dad got mad at her for yelling at me and they argued and argued, which climaxed when we were on the boat and she got down on her knees, once again screaming and crying, violently grabbed and squeezed my hands, and started yelling about how \u201csorry\u201d she was for yelling at me (if you couldn\u2019t tell by the quotation marks, it was not a genuine apology) and my dad had to leave to driver seat of the boat to rip my hands from hers and we almost crashed and died. In retrospect, that might\u2019ve been scarier than the 911 thing. \nHere\u2019s just some random shit with no theme. If any of my grades ever dip below 91, all of my stuff will be taken away, which makes me fucking petrified of ever getting a B. If I ever get caught with my door closed and I am not naked or in danger, it will be removed from its hinges. My parents genuinely believe that I am not qualified to have opinions, privacy, autonomy, etc. until I turn 18. My mom picks everything: my hair, my clothes, my decorations, my classes, my future. She has my college picked, and she is making me do the IB program even though I really don\u2019t want to. Remember those weird, outdated opinions on gender my mom has? Yeah, she is also very sexist (when convenient for her) and really into gender roles (again, when convenient for her). She has constantly made fun of me for any emotion I\u2019ve ever had, any time I\u2019ve ever freaked out, anything weird I\u2019ve ever done, and such. Now I heavily repress my emotions and I literally cannot get myself to cry anymore. I also struggle to form strong emotions on anything. My one respite is fiction. I love fiction books, shows, games. I love writing them too. Everything is perfect and beautiful in them.\nAnyway, back to shit. I\u2019ve had really bad anxiety my whole life, and my mom and other family members judge me and make fun of me for it. I\u2019m am constantly paranoid that there might be someone hiding, waiting to kill me. I had to sleep with my parents until I was twelve. My mom has made me watch horror movies, has locked me out when it is pitch black outside, and spent years popping out of corners and scaring me. I remember I had my first panic attack in 4th grade. I woke up in the middle of the night and was bawling my fucking eyes out. It was very confusing. I\u2019m also scared of social interaction and things like presentations and speaking tests. My blood feels like it\u2019s boiling and I frequently feel like vomiting in high anxiety situations. Panic attacks are bitches. I am scared of the dark and of heights and of insects. I have to listen to ASMR every night to fall asleep both because of the fear of the dark and another reason that I\u2019ll talk about now.\nA few months into quarantine, I had a massive existential crisis and am now fucking terrified of death. If I go to bed w/o ASMR distracting me, I am reminded of my own mortality via my brain. I\u2019m pretty sure I have depression now, if I didn\u2019t before. However, again, I can\u2019t be sure because of parents. Over winter break of 2020, I lost 20 pounds in two weeks, and went long stretches of time being completely unable to feel any joy whatsoever. The only things that make me happy when I\u2019m depressed are Smash, writing, and some obsession I may have, and those are still inconsistent. But wait, obsession? Yeah, I periodically get obsessed with a piece of media, such as fe3h, Steven universe, Harley Quinn, etc. I cannot think about anything else, and if I am not consuming that media I feel terrible. \nJumping around more, I also get extraordinarily bored very easily, to the point where I feel like crying. I remember one time I started crying of boredom at the opera, and I frequently get maddeningly bored at school. I have been told it is depression, but it has been happening since I was a small boi. Idk tho, maybe I\u2019ve had depression for years and it was just exacerbated by the existential crisis.\nOne part of the depression has been loneliness. I feel starved both physically and emotionally (not physically like sexually or anything, more just touch starved), and I want a partner so fucking bad when I\u2019m depressed (such as right now) to just cuddle me and tell me everything will be ok and that they love me. It\u2019s odd, because it\u2019s even worse now that I don\u2019t currently have a crush, because there is not even a chance of me getting a partner for the foreseeable future. \nI haven\u2019t been depressed in a while now, which I suppose is good, but I am now, which obviously is not good and is why I felt like writing this fucking text vomit. If you read all of this, you are fucking king \ud83d\udc51 (or queen or whatever kind of royalty you want to be called). I don\u2019t know what I am hoping to get from this post but it\u2019s off my chest now and honestly feels pretty good, and maybe it was interesting to read. Anyway, Imma go to bed now. (Also, a note: idk if this is actually nsfw or not, so imma just tag it as such to be safe)"

The crash, how it makes me feel, the short duration of action, the side effects, etc. It made my life better in some ways but worse in other ways.\n\nRecently I started taking 10mg of meth a day once in the morning and my life has changed. Where ritalin made symptoms of my other disorders worse while treating some symptoms of my ADHD, meth just completely made me feel as close as I think a normal person should feel. I started building healthy habits, stopped missing classes, even started coming to class early, I can keep up with my responsibilities and be responsible, and best part is i only need to take it once a day in the morning and i never feel like i need to take more.\n\nI already did my own research to educate myself on what i'm doing to my brain but so far I haven't seen evidence of meth being particularly more harmful than amphetamine, especially when used in therapeutic doses to treat ADHD. All the papers I read that describe its neurotoxicity involve ridiculously high dosages of meth which will obviously do damage to your brain, but I haven't seen any evidence that 10mg a day will fry your brain. In fact some I read showed that it can be neuroprotective in therapeutic doses",

However, as much as ritalin has really helped me overcome (not fully alleviate) some of my challenges living with ADHD, it also made my life worse in other ways. To make it short, ritalin can make me feel too excited in certain situations (almost manic) and I jump into commitments impulsively that I end up not being able to keep up with, and whenever I have a hyperfixation I am unable to shift my attention away from it (unless I have a tight deadline or someone else initiates doing work together etc.). Also, the anxiety I get from it plus the short duration of action really makes me feel often like I need to take more of the substance (because when 10mg makes me nervous 20mg calms me better), and because I need to take it twice a day with a break in between it really starts to become habit forming.\n\nRecently I accidentally discovered that meth works better for ADHD than everything else and gives far less side effects, and also the fact that its neurotoxicity is only present at super high recreational doses, so this week I started dosing on meth through my rectum (boofing) since I don't have it in pill form, starting with 5mg and going up to 10mg with I felt is good enough. It was immediately life changing as for the first time I was able to ignore my impulsive thoughts and was finally able to pay attention in class and focus on my work, keep up with my responsibilities and tell myself that my hyperfixations can wait till next week. Literally from day one I stopped missing classes, started waking up early, and going to class not nearly as late as I used to. I also feel like due to my way better impulse control and executive function, I feel like I'm a more responsible adult than a child who needs to be told what to do (I'm in my mid twenties in uni), I'm able to shift my attention so easily to what's important rather than what my brain really wants to focus on. Task switching and attention regulation is way way way way better.\n\nThe side effects are only limited to my loss of appetite, and since I only need to dose on it once a day in the morning and it lasts me the entire goddamn day without and comedown I never ever feel like I needed to dose more than once in a day, unlike with ritalin, and I feel like I am able to live life a lot more similar to a normal person than a person with adhd who is on meds. I feel like I actually no longer have ADHD, while back on ritalin I felt like I still have ADHD but I have a crutch to help. Basically I am never going back to ritalin. \n\nBut heres the thing. Everytime I need to dose in the morning I have to measure it out in my milligram scale and dissolve it in saline and suck it up the syringe and all, I'm wondering if it's alright to just dissolve all my crystals in saline (I have around 500mg) store in a dark container so that I can just conveniently dose it volumetrically with a clean syringe, get the volume I need and dose. Will it last a long time? What are precautions I need to take note of? I hope you have the answers to my questions because I've been looking around for a bit and I want to make sure that I don't ruin my supply of self medication\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d its been only a few days but meth has already changed my life ;-;",

                "body": "That's not true. I'm prescribed 20mg ritalin twice a day and I hate the side effects of ritalin. It makes me jittery, sometimes a bit manic and over confident even, makes my heart race, makes me nervous and anxious and gives me random 5 seconds bursts of depression and anxiety throughout the day and lowkey sometimes makes me feel like I need to take more to function better because the side effects are so debilitating. Meth doesnt give me any of that, doesnt make me feel manic and like I need to have more of it. It just makes me calm without feeling super anxious and nervous and like my heart is about to explode.\n\nIt also makes sense given meth crosses the blood brain barrier way faster than other stims which limits its effects to mostly the CNS stimulating effects and giving less of the bodily side effects like anxiety and increased heart rate. In fact it is precisely due to the lack of negative side effects of meth that make it less desirable of a prescribed medication than the others, because the negative side effects of methylphenidate and amphetamine are supposed to prevent people from taking too much. Its fucking stupid though given both from my personal experience and reviews of desoxyn tablets, how amazing the drug is in comparison to the other adhd stims in actually treating ADHD. For context, I am now starting on 5mg methamphetamine a day and seeing how it goes. So far it feels way less euphoric and more calm, than ritalin.",

                "body": "**So a bit of a background:**\n\nI just got diagnosed with ADHD this year along with GAD and OCPD, and discovered that I might also have quiet subtype BPD. I am prescribed 20mg of ritalin twice a day and while it helps me calm my thoughts and get stuff done, I still have very little control over my mood and emotions, where it can quickly swing between extremes based on my environment, people around me, things people say or do, and the music I listen to. \n\nVery small things can trigger me, and I live life like im on edge, constantly looking out for potential danger or fear or saying something wrong and hurting other people. Apart from mood being volatile, I would also feel these emotions very very intensely compared to other people and I often feel strongly about things, which can influence my impulsive decision making, which is a huge problem in my life.\n\nAnother thing to take note is also that I started growing this kind is feeling of dependency on ritalin and coffee, often feeling like I am not having enough and I need more to function, but I always made sure to never go beyond what I was prescribed for ritalin, although I would always look for coffee throughout the day.\n\n**So, on to self-medication with MDMA**\n\nLast night I took half a pill of ecstasy (130mg) hoping it could help with my crippling anxiety and BPD symptoms, fully aware that it could go either way down or up, but I just went for it anyway. Ngl, I didn't feel good at all during the time it took effect. I felt weird and dizzy, my body became extremely hot, and I got incredibly sleepy. I realised at some point that I might have made a mistake by consuming coffee at around the same time, and took the pill only around 4 hours after my ritalin dose.\n\nSo around 3 hours in, I decided to attempt to go to sleep since I always had trouble falling asleep during the right time of the day (I can only sleep around sunrise these days and function at night). While on bed I listened to music that would normally make me feel sad, melancholic, and feel intense emotions and self pity, just to see how I  would feel, and oh boy, it felt as though my mood and emotions were super calm and stable. I would describe it like that first time I took ritalin, except that instead of only calming my thoughts, it also calmed my emotions, and I felt that exact same way like I was first on ritalin. I feel like my brain was trying to be sad but something was preventing it from going down there. \n\nThen I eventually noticed that I no longer had these self degrading thoughts that would always tell me how shit and useless I am make me scream insults at myself calling myself stupid. No, for the first time in as long as I can remember, I no longer had those thoughts taunting me constantly. I can appreciate and enjoy everything in my senses.\n\nI went to sleep and woke up the next morning, the earliest I had ever woken up without an alarm and without a need to (like appointments) in months, and oh boy. I normally wake up feeling like absolute garbage until I take my ritalin. This had been my life basically everyday even before I discovered ADHD and got medicated, so its not like I have a drug addiction or something. But this morning, I just felt ok, normal, I don't feel like garbage, I did my morning routine and I didn't even feel like I needed to take ritalin to function anymore, I just feel okay, not nearly as restless as I would normally feel without ritalin, I could sit down and eat without feeling like shit. \n\nAfter taking ritalin, I didn't even feel any huge difference in the way I feel anymore. Its not that I didn't feel better, its that I didn't feel bad in the first place for me to feel much difference. I could function even after my ritalin wore off and even then I couldn't even tell anymore when it has worn off.\n\nAnd I realised at a point that I was no longer desperate for coffee and ritalin. I don't have this feeling of \"am i on enough ritalin? should i take more?\" or feeling like I really need to drink sweet coffee. Its like my kind of dependency or almost addiction to stimulants just vanished overnight. \n\nI went outside to go to school, and god, for the first time in forever, I was able to walk around in public without a feeling of constant fear or everything bad that could happen. I would talk to people without feeling too uncomfortable overthinking about how I am making them feel, no longer felt intensely nervous around people and the feel of the need to always apologise to people for no reason. I no longer feel hyper sensitive to what people say anymore.\n\nThe only downside to this new feeling is that I no longer feel emotions as intensely as I used to before, like when I listen to music. I thrive off that kind of energy, those intense feelings, they drive my passion and even though they consist of both bad and good emotions, I really enjoyed experiencing both of them. This got better throughout the day though.\n\nngl, I'm actually a bit worried if it had any effect on the efficacy of ritalin on my brain, and tbh I kinda really miss my intense mood swings, I feel like it defined me as a person. But it's not bad to not feel like i'm constantly on edge anymore. Oh also, because of the stabilised mood and emotions, I feel like for the first time ever I'm actually no longer impulsive.\n\nNo idea what tomorrow is gonna look like for me, but I hope nothing seriously bad happens."

Or is this a normal thing? I would think that the main thing that separates a demiromantic from an alloromantic is that an allo would easily get crushes with people in real life and even celebrities, as easy as with fictional characters. (I would think that for demiromantic people, crushing on celebrities isn't a thing either because unlike fictional characters there isn't a way for you to really connect with them emotionally).\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"

(and one that no one talks about when it comes to OCD). Just to give even more context, I am on the asexual spectrum so none of the following have anything to do with sexual attraction or drive.\n\nExamples of these symptoms I am referring to:\n- having a constant irrational fear that I might sexually harass someone (usually like a friend, or a friend's girlfriend, rarely strangers)\n- going to my friend's house and their mom talking to me nicely, I have this irrational fear that their mum is into me \n- when i was younger, used to have this constant fear that if im alone with my own mum my dad would get jealous or suspect we are doing \"stuff\" (i do NOT WANT to do anything gross with or to my mum but these thoughts ALWAYS come to my head against my will, also my dad definitely does not feel that way he is a normal person)\n- I used to fear my dad finding out that I'm gay, except **I'm not even gay to begin with**\n- Used to happen 100% of the time when I was younger (happens a lot less now), but I used to fear accidentally attracting women or leading them on (I have zero sexual appeal, even since young, so this is stupid) when I'm not into them, so I just avoided talking to women \n\nIn general I think these intrusive thoughts go by a general pattern of potentially destroying relationships with people I'm close to but there's more i don't remember \n\nWhile I do experience a LOT of other symptoms of OCD (extreme perfectionism that annoys people i work with, washing my hands way more frequently than the average person, tics, etc. all the stuff other people can physically see with their own eyes), now I'm just really unsure about the stuff that happens in my head that no one can see, which I argue affects me more than the stuff I do externally, because I don't know what goes on in the head of a normal person I don't know if these things are normal. I always thought they were and normal people had this level of anxiety/paranoia but it appears as if these are actually OCD symptoms?\n\nEdit: To be more precise, my question is, do the kind of intrusive thoughts I described as examples sound like stuff regular people think about, or are they signs of OCD?"

I'm thinking if I can manage at least a B for most of my mods I'm good. Also thinking of doing more projects like research (outside my field of major).\n\nNow I'm wondering, between grades and experience, which one do employers look at, if say I excel in one but completely neglected the other. I know ideally you should balance, but there's just so much I want to do for the school in terms of events and stuff that I don't think I'll have time to think about studies if I wanted to achieve all the things I want to do before graduation. \n\nLogically speaking I feel like these experiences should be more valuable to employers (while grades would only be important if one were to want to pursue higher studies like postgrad and go into academia) but I could be wrong, so I wanted to ask, anyone of you went through this route of uni? How did that turn out for you after you graduated?\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you so much everyone for your valuable responses!! I've read most of your comments so far and I'll try to respond to them one by one! But I think to summarise some key points from the responses I got (and also what I can interpret from them):\n- It's hard to quantify soft-skills on paper/resume, so they still look at quantifiable metrics (ie. GPA) **first**. Only after passing that stage will they look at your soft-skills.\n- Low GPA indicates low commitment to school and thus lack of interest and lack of ability to prioritise/manage time/ do what ur supposed to\n- Internship more important than CCA\n- When you're a fresh grad, the positions you are going to apply for are probably entry-level, which means that on the ground hard-skills relevant to your field is more important than leadership skills, since they would need someone who can do the job, so they would look at GPA and internship experience. Leadership skills etc. would probably be more relevant after you climb the ladder a bit but by then, in-school experience would probably be less relevant since you'd have probably gained experience in the corporate world by then\n- Need to graduate with honors, which requires good GPA, else very hard to get hired\n\nThanks a lot for your input, I really really appreciate it! I guess I'll have to re-evaluate my priorities from here on. For now, I'm thinking of at least maintaining a bare minimum 3.5CGPA (to be fair when I said 'neglect' I was really thinking of a straight B xD cos my standards for \"passing\" is kinda high to begin with lol. I guess the reason for that is also because the average GPA of all of my closest friends in school is almost a 5.0 so compared to them my below 4.0 GPA looks very bad in comparison LOL. But ok, at least now I know that I **cannot** fall below a 3.5 or at least 3 by any means lol)"

Zowel teveel dingen op je bord als juist saaie monotonie zijn niet fantastisch. \n\n- vraag of er veel andere kandidaten zijn, of er een tweede ronde is en wanneer je hoort of je het geworden bent. Hele ontwijkende antwoorden zijn een vlag, een gewoon antwoord is juist handig als je op meerdere plekken solliciteert.\n\n- vraag om een omschrijving van het team waarin de nieuwe werknemer komt. Positieve omschrijving is positief, afkraken = vlag.",

The contestants can use multiple votes, borrowing them from the future, but once used the votes don't replenish. Every tribal council you have to vote with at least one ballot until they run out. Only the person who won immunity can choose to save up and not vote.\n\nNow the thing is, the Dutch franchise here doesn't have a jury, but instead the winner is chosen by a finaly contest among the finalists. There's also no hidden immunity idols, but immunity idols can be won by winning specific reward challenges in which the reward is an immunity idol. So it's much less secretive in that regard, but the amount of votes a person still has is the secret element.\n\nI was wondering what you think would happen if you let loose a voting system like this onto a series with hidden idols and a jury. Would it be complete chaos? Would it change strategy for better or for worse?"

Last week the first episode of season 24 (all stars) of the Dutch survivor franchise premiered, and I want to discuss if the way they did their all stars cast is a good idea or not.\n\nThey only casted final 4 contestants of the last 12 seasons.\n\nA positive about this is that it makes a lot less sense to vote out finalists first because they already had their adventure. Everyone competing made it to the last or second to last day. There's no experience advantage either to keep people around.\n\nA negative is that the cast doesn't meet the diversity standards that we are used to, because they could only ask this pool of 48 people and have to cross their fingers that enough people say yes. From the pre season interviews, it was apparent that even those who said yes had initial doubts whether to go through survivor again (note: there's no million to win at the end). This resulted in a cast of 10 men and 6 women, with no women of colour.\n\nSo a question to you: would you think a modern all stars season should only cast finalists and semi-finalists of recent seasons, possibly sacrificing diversity? Or would you rather that it included fun-for-TV boots that might hold a grudge that they didn't complete their season?"

At least that's the case for me: just seeing and hearing doesn't take up enough \"bandwidth\" to keep me occupied, I need to do something with my hands as well.\n\nSo here's the hack: go watch the film or series while next to the items of the chore. Just casually take the chopping board with you to the living room, or put the hamper next to you. Magically, within 5-10 minutes, my hands have started doing whatever needed to be done anyway, plus I can now concentrate better on what I was watching. It's a little slower than mono-tasking the chore obviously, but getting it done slowly is better than putting it off another day.\n\nNote: it's important in my case that the main activity is the watching of content. If it doesn't happen that your hands wander, that's okay too, that means you've found content that's actually captivating and that's great too."

And I was afraid that my meds ruined my sleep schedule.\n\nHowever, I've been wearing my smartwatch all this time and it appears that ever since I found the right dose about 7 weeks ago, I consistently sleep about 45 minutes less naturally. My deep sleep (stage 3+4) has improved from 25-30% to almost 50%. There appears to be a study that stimulant meds boost sleep efficiency (more deep sleep, less waking up randomly), but it also could be caused by me simply being less tired and overwhelmed and stressed all the time.\n\nDid you find you were less tired or needed less sleep on meds too?"

Below are some clarifications:\n\n24, Male, No Debt, no student loans, no car payment\n\nIncome: Entry level Engineering position\n\nCash Savings ($11,842): this is probably too high for my spendings but I believe markets are high now and waiting for drop, advise if I am mistaken.\n\nStocks/ETFs: Sitting at around 10% unrealized profit spread across 13 positions, don't ask about crypto...\n\nRent($7,800): Living with roommate and landlord \\~40min from Downtown Houston.\n\nEating Out ($2,405): This also includes any liquid bought outside supermarkets, I realized too late that it should be separate category, it's considerable amount.\n\nDonations/Gifts($3,849): This is high, but I never had money before so I finally got a chance to share it with Family/Friends, it will probably be lower next year, I only have GF since this year.\n\nAuto($3,826): In June 2020 I pulled all my savings at that moment and bought car for $7,200 in cash in This diagram is only from July 2020 and hence this cost is not included.\n\nRandom Expenses($1,041): I prefer not to share details on this one, but it needed to be paid.\n\nAmazon($608): This was most shocking because all my random items bought from amazon are $5-50 but I guess it added up over a year, I will make sure to lower this significantly.\n\nClothes($780): This is high, but I needed new clothes, it will definitely be lower next year.\n\nHealth($1,013): I switched from health/dental/vision to paying $100/month into HAS. I didn't have any health related spendings."

I've gone into other details about me [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/jj8yi1/ive_been_looking_into_mbti_for_45_years_and_still/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and one person (who private messaged me) typed me as \"Either ENFP or ESFP\", and another, in the comments, typed me as INTJ, which is almost the opposite, so I figured I'd try again!\n\nThis quiz, like most quizzes, wasn't done in one shot; I had to complete it in short bursts (especially why procrastinating on homework) but anyways!\n\nI can't really figure out what to make of it. My top three  type results were ENFP for 59, ENTP for 50, and ESFP for 47 points. This is how my chart thingy matches up with ENFP: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4clsf19y9y51.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0e0c642f55e55f5e019177657f795710c3b09ba1\n\nI'm not sure if Ne would actually be my dominant function or not, and the biggest problem I've had with typing myself, whether with a test or with other methods, is that I feel like I'm pretty close with all the functions. I think I may just be too close to my own brain and it's probably really obvious for everyone else but me. \n\nIn case yall don't wanna click the link to the questionnaire-type post, I will share that I have anxiety disorders, a mood disorder, c-PTSD and am getting tested for ADHD in a week. \n\nAt this point as far as MBTI goes, I feel just as lost as I did in 2015 when I started looking into stuff, so I'm not sure where this leaves me. Any input is appreciated."

                "body": "**How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI'm 20, nonbinary (assigned female at birth, if that matters), I'm a music student, a writer, and someone who people find weird. I'm pretty close with my family and get along really well with me siblings but I get irritated easily which can be a problem. I have a lot of basic friends and acquaintances but I only regularly talk to 5-7 of them. I live at home with my parents and my two younger siblings.\n\n**Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?**\n\nI'm in the process of getting tested for ADHD, which I truly believe I have. I have social anxiety, general anxiety, and some type of depression, though that diagnosis was informal, and I don't remember specifics. I also have (c-)PTSD. Basically I'm a disaster lol. I tend to joke that if I wasn't anxious, I'd be an adrenaline junkie and an extrovert, but I still wonder if other things could get in the way.\n\n**Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nSo I grew up in a household that wasn't strictly religious, but for periods of my earlier childhood we'd go to the local Episcopal church, and I was baptized and did my first communion there. For a period of time we ran the church thrift shop on Saturdays, and I was the cashier. I was 6-8 at this time, if I recall.\n\nAside from that, my parents had a strong emphasis on education until I was about 7, so I could watch educational kids shows or Cartoon Network, and that was basically it. Because I displayed so much interest in my older brother's homework, my mom would print off worksheets for me when I was 3, and she worked with me on counting, addition, reading, etc. I loved it, and I started Kindergarten reading and doing math on a 2nd or 3rd grade level.\n\n**What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI don't currently have a job or career, aside from personal projects (but, not paid so not really a job). I was looking before I started college, but now I don't know that I could handle both workloads. I'm aiming to start or get hired at a recording studio after I've finished my degree(s), but I'd be lucky to do anything within the realm of music.\n\n**If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nThat depends: Am I completely alone, or with family? Can I talk to people on the phone or by message? Let's say I'm home alone with just myself and no messengers or anything. I'd be kinda miserable in that case. Actually, come to think of it, even when everyone is home and I have my phone, sitting in my room by myself to get work done feels pretty awful. I need at least family interaction to get through the day, and honestly thrive on talking to friends and family throughout my day.\n\n**What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?**\n\nHere's the thing: I'm very overweight (I have PCOS and the hormone issues cause insulin resistance, making it hard for me to lose weight), but I still enjoy a lot of outdoor activities; for years I've enjoyed riding kick scooters and skateboards, as well as trampolines, swimming, and nerf gun wars. Additionally, I recently picked up an interest in Lacrosse. Since moving across the country, it's gotten a little trickier, because we don't have a concrete driveway on any property we own, and our trampoline was second-hand and needed work since we've obtained it. I'm not known for being a particularly outdoorsy person, but I certainly have my fair share of things I love to do outside.\n\n**How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nOh boy, this is going to be a little long. I have a lot of ideas, many of which get shot down in the early stages. My brain has never really shut off, so the only time I'm not coming up when ideas is, ironically, when I'm asked for ideas. I've had plenty of business or NPO ideas, and as a writer, I have a wellspring of plot ideas or scene ideas. I have song ideas I don't know how to execute well. A lot of times it's ideas of things I can do, sometimes it's ideas of what I can say or use later, and what I mean by that is that I get into debates about LGBTQ or disabled/neurodivergent rights, etc., and there are times I come up with brilliant examples that would strengthen my argument. The flipside of that is I've also come up with counterarguments, and thought my way out of that. As a result, I've gotten better at handling trolls without getting angry.\n\n**Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nI always say I would enjoy being a leader, but I have trouble staying on task and remembering what I need to do (Because of the suspected ADHD), so in the past when I've attempted to lead things, if it wasn't something I was currently fixated on, I'd forget that the thing existed and it would inevitably fall apart. Of course, this has been with startup-stage projects, not in the case of taking over a specific role, but nonetheless...\n\nWhen taking on leadership roles, I tend to be a little more on the pushover side, but generally I like to hear opinions and take a very democratic approach. I believe that if you're involved in a project, you should have at least some say in how it goes. I don't know that I'd be good at it, because I feel like my ideals would get in the way; I think I'm likelier to be taken advantage of as a leader.\n\n**Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI'm semi-coordinated. I work well with my hands (I play guitar, knit, crochet, build things, make things, the works) but can't draw very well and... don't ask me to cut anything out. Otherwise I'm pretty clumsy. I have had times where I lose my balance while I'm standing still with both feet on the ground. I tend to walk into things pretty often, and have occasionally missed a stair, though that's more because of some brain malfunction where I go \"Oh I can do this\" and do it before I can stop myself.\n\n**Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nI'm not good at drawing. I have a few types of synesthesia, including sound->color, so I can make abstract art of what a song looks like, and that will convey from brain to hand to paper/screen well, but I cannot draw people well, and objects are only slightly better.\n\nDespite what others say, I view myself as a pretty average musician (I don't see any particular talents other than being a fast learner), though I'm pretty good with rhythm. College has helped me to get much better with rhythm, sight reading, and training my ear, luckily, so I've gotten further in the past year and a half than I ever progressed on my own.\n\nI was previously enrolled in a program that was Multimedia/Video (short story: the uni nearby calls their audio engineering program \"Multimedia Arts Technology\" and I assumed that the closest community college's major with a similar name was the same thing, and it wasn't) and did alright with story concepts and framing storyboards in a way I could actually draw. I've attempted 3D modeling and didn't get far but didn't do bad for a first time.\n\n**What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nRegardless of whether I enjoy this or not, I guess the past kinds of ends up being the map and the future is the goal. I hate when quizzes ask \"are you more past or future oriented\" because the simplest answer is neither. Without really wanting to, I tend to assume things are the same as what I've experienced, so when people act a certain way, I relate them to people I've known before who have done the same. In a situation recently with a classmate low-key bullying a group of my friends, I (correctly) stated that, from past experience, odds are the school wouldn't be able to help us.\n\nI look to the future often, though. I have some solid goals I move forward for, like my career goals or just certain events that are coming up soon. Sometimes I think ahead about getting my Bachelor's degree and that's more stress than anything, but I spend a fair amount of time thinking to the future.\n\nFinally, I also spend time in the present, if the present is engaging enough. I'm usually oriented in the near future or a few years in the past, but if not, then I'm thinking about what I should or shouldn't be doing (such as, I should be doing philosophy homework, not this), or what I'd like to do when I'm done doing what I'm doing.\n\nAlso, sidenote, I like positive change that I know about in advance. I don't like bad change. I don't like sudden change, usually.\n\n**How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nIf I'm in the middle of something, I have a tendency to get a little too frustrated when I'm pulled away, though this is something I'm working on. Generally, I love to help, and even when I don't, I feel obligated because I'm usually the person asked. I like feeling needed and/or wanted. As I mentioned, my mother has some mobility issues, so I've had to take on more chores and tasks than normal, from things as simple as making Hot Cocoa in the Keurig all the way up to helping her get dressed or wash her hair. She hates asking but I don't usually mind helping.\n\nI'm often the counselor for friends, and if they don't need advice, I'm the ventspace. I don't typically mind this, because I like knowing what's going on with people, but sometimes I can't handle other peoples' bigger stressors. I've been considered an Empath, and I have tended to take on other people's problems as if they were my own. It's not always good for my mental health, but I don't like to turn people away because I don't know if they have others to talk to at that time, and I don't want to feel responsible if anything happens because I wasn't available.\n\n**~~Do you need logical consistency in your life?~~** **(I don't understand the question)**\n\n**How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nMore important than it needs to be. I'm constantly worrying that I'm not doing enough, to the point that if I don't feel like I've done enough, I'll be reluctant to sleep. It's a bit of an issue. I, hypothetically, do a lot, even if it's a lot of small stuff, and I know that it's not possible to be perfectly efficient and productive all the time, but nonetheless, I have some problems with this all.\n\nUltimately, if I could be productive and efficient with all the things I need to do, I'd like that just because that means more free time, but again, not possible or reasonable.\n\n**Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nNot on purpose, but yeah, sometimes I'm pretty good at getting what I want and it bothers me.\n\nI work hard to be as authentic and honest as possible. That also means that people believe me more when something happens, even if I'm wrong. I, apparently, have a hidden talent for connotations, and could turn someone's innocent action into a not-so-innocent one with little thought, though I've never done that purposely. I'm very in tune with my moral compass, but in debates, it'll show up more than I want things to. This has benefits, though, just because it helps with writing.\n\n**What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nMusic could be considered a hobby, though it's also my area of study and hopefully one day my career. I love creating something that sounds beautiful, and there's a certain form of expression that music can work with but words cannot. I enjoy writing stories, and these have served as a venting space, though I don't often publish my stories; since a lot of them are for helping me work through things, I don't think they'd be reader worthy. I enjoy watching YouTube and TikTok videos, especially things about Reddit, LGBTQ+ stuff, or disability advocation. I've recently started trying cosplays, and that's been pretty fun. Also, I really like video games! I've been occupying time with Among Us, but my other favorite games are Minecraft, [Bloodsports.TV](https://Bloodsports.TV), and Portal 2.\n\n**What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nTraditional learning styles? I'm much better at working with my hands than anything, but I've tested close in visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Generally, I learn better by doing, but a combination of video and sound will also work well. This has been an advantage to music classes, like choir and guitar lessons, because it applies singing or sightreading, and if I have any issues, I can listen and watch. Memorization isn't a lot of trouble for me, because I'm a quick learner (though history is still a weakness), and logic is... hit or miss. Creativity and physical senses might be the easiest for me.\n\n**How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI'm good with simple strategies in games, and in real life, I can strategize easier, but in the context of projects? Still working on it. I'm still learning myself, so with homework, I'm still revising my strategy. There has to be something better than \"work on this one till it's due, then this till *it's* due, then have 7 hours to complete this one\". When it comes to story writing, I'm a little better with it because I've been doing that since I was 13 (I was homeschooled from 6th grade until college, and this is my first time in virtual schooling since I was 8), so with writing I know I need a loose plan that covers parts of beginning, middle, and end, but is left loose enough that I can change things or add things in. There's a mixture of structure and improvisation, usually, and that's also how day planning goes; I have some things I have to do, but also room for everything else.\n\n**What's important to you and why?**\n\nMy family is important to me, because they're honestly great and I wouldn't be where I am without them. My partner is important to me because they're so sweet and nice and encouraging and amazing. My friends are important to me because they've shown me I was important to them, and also because we have so much fun and such depth and... Yeah, there's a lot. Music is important to me because it was my best form of release and self expression for so many years, and it's the only thing I can see myself being truly happy doing for the rest of my life. My stories are important to me because I've had some good ideas and these stories hold so much in them that if I ever lost them all I'd be truly crushed. Where I am now and the progress I've made is important to me because despite everything, I'm here. My memories are important to me because I have had so many good experiences and bad experiences that I've learned from, and so many people I miss and so many that I love.\n\n**What are your aspirations?**\n\nI want to graduate college with my Associate's and go on to get a Bachelor's in Multimedia Arts Tech or some other music production/audio engineering based degree. I want to work as a recording engineer and my my own music on the side. Whether I gain recognition for my music or my production doesn't matter as much, but I'd like to make a living doing what I love.\n\n**What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI'm afraid of being unloved or completely alone. I've got a fear of heights, drowning, suffocating, death, and nightmares. I don't like passive-aggression. I hate when people try to pick on others for no reason. I don't particularly like to witness violence in person; if it's in a movie, show, story, boxing match, etc., it's fine, but I don't want to see people get hurt for non-entertainment purposes. Bullying in general makes me very uncomfortable and can actually be a trigger depending on some circumstances. Also, I'm not too fond of spiders, snakes, or stinkbugs.\n\n**What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nOn my best days, I'm doing well in school or am on break. I'm being creative, confident, and affectionate. I'm achieving without feeling pressured to do so, and interacting with my friends, family, and partner.\n\n**What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nOn my worst days, I'm constantly dealing with panic attacks and/or sensory overloads, I'm worried about pushing my friends away, and I have no motivation to do anything ever. I'm getting mad at myself for not getting anything done.\n\n**How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nIt depends on what you mean by daydream. I don't often full on imagine interactions or anything, but I do often get lost in thought. Usually, I'm still very aware of my surroundings, though my listening abilities go downhill, and usually, the daydream is caused by something in my surroundings or a thought that sparked from surroundings. One exception is, for example, on roadtrips, when I'm dozing off listening to music. I will have thoughts that turn into dreams in a light sleep, and will not be aware that things are going on unless something happens to interrupt my thoughts.\n\n**Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nI'd probably think about everything I was going to do after leaving the blank room. I'd wonder what my loved ones were doing and if they're okay. I'd wonder if anyone was looking for me or missed me. When all else failed I'd start singing and drumming and dancing and stuff like that. I'd probably, at some point, try to take a nap and if I couldn't, then do weird things like rolling around on the floor. I'd maybe start trying to teach myself to cartwheel or handstand, and maybe stretch or do yoga, all the while hoping that I'd get out of there soon since there's nothing else to do.\n\n**How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI often take too long. I've gotten a little better at speeding it up (ie, \"if you're disappointed in this idea, maybe the other one fits better\") but I'm indecisive and I always wonder if I'll regret a decision later. I do change my mind often but not all the time. Sometimes I consider changing my mind but then realize I made the best choice, even if it feels odd in the moment.\n\n**How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nSometimes it can take a while. I can't really control my emotions but I'd rather have them than to be numb. When I'm numb, I feel robotic, and then when I get my emotions back on they're all over the place (or, more so than usual). Ultimately I recognize emotions and then process them in a few stages, I think, but it depends on the emotions and circumstances of course. \n\n**Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nAll the time, yeah. I will disagree if it's important enough, but thanks to trauma, anxiety, etc., I'm a people pleaser and I hate conflict. I'm much better at online arguments and debates but I really worry with people I know in a face-to-face environment that me disagreeing or arguing will result in either violence or, in the case of my college classmates/friends/acquaintances, me getting shunned and/or bullied. With close friends, I disagree more freely, and if the debate that follows gets to be too much, we have no issue shutting it down for another time and place if we so desire. I'm glad I'm in a position where I feel comfortable doing that, it it's gotten easier to disagree with people as a result. \n\n**Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nI think rules are a grey area. Some rules are not worth following, in my opinion, so sometimes I do break rules. For example, in an Amino community I'm in, there's a rule in a chat room to \"Be Nice\". For the most part, I'll follow that, but if someone's in there being rude, I no longer feel the need to be nice to them. That's pretty rational, I would think. Other rules I can and will break include not discussing politics, religion, etc., and I actually discuss it with people often. There are other rules I've broken that I'm blanking on right now. Generally, though, I like to play by the rules when the rules make sense to me. I do think authority can and should be challenged. Some people who make the rules are just as lost as the rest of us, and if they can't explain their reasonings and logic, why should I be listening to them? Additionally, I cheat at games sometimes. Like in Among Us my partner and I can and have shared our crewmate/impostor status and, if murdered, who our killer was. This is just for our own anxieties but it's still technically cheating. \n\n**What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**\n\nMy ideal life is one in which I'm making a comfortable living working in music. I'm living near my immediate family, but also near my partner, my friends, and other loved ones. I get to have a good work-life balance and give back to people, organizations, and communities that helped me out and donate to people who need it. I would be able to help advocate for LGBTQ+ and disabled/neurodivergent rights. Myself and those around me would all be happy and relatively healthy."

I ended up with a 34J that I noticed was still a tiny bit small on the cups but the fitter said most styles only go up to a J and she didn\u2019t believe I needed to go bigger. I bought the bra as it was comfortable and looked good at the time.\n\nWore it to work the next day. Come my lunch break I am in so much pain my right tit had completely fallen out the cup and I was starting to bruise at the side of my ribs. We only get half an hour for breaks so I couldn\u2019t go and change. Was trapped in it for all my 8 hour shift working retail. Got home was nearly crying. Had big red marks from underwire digging into the side of my ribs/back. Much worse than the too small bras I\u2019d been wearing before that. And now the marks are bruises 4 days later. \n\nI usually have good experiences with bravissimo but I guess not this time. I wouldn\u2019t blame the fitter but tbh she didn\u2019t seem to know what she was doing. The bra was \u00a336 and I work minimum wage so not great. \n\nI really hope they accept the return when I go back to the store tomorrow since I did wear it and tags are gone.\n\nI\u2019m just stuck at this point. I bought a bralette online in Black Friday sale for \u00a39 (34J/JJ) not expecting much but it fits and is comfy just doesn\u2019t offer support so I still don\u2019t have a bra and am in pain every single day."

Nothing keeps me secure, they always ride down and sit on my stomach.\n\nI\u2019ve got 30 bands that do the same but crush me also.\n\nIs there a type of bra I can try or a brand etc that could help me with this or is it a lost cause. \n\nI end up with huge bruises and marks on my stomach at the end of the day.\n\nI do tighten my straps also and that doesn\u2019t really help and leaves me with very sore shoulders with marks and bruises there too."

Here\u2019s how to get higher challenges:\n\n1. Make your mix levels between 5-7 (if you play on easy mode 4x, add fade in or out)\n2. Play with you best cards! Try with the songs with a good pack so the algorithm can see that you\u2019re able to play higher levels.\n3. Marvelous/excellent hits will help you to get higher scores so try to make the most of them.\n4. The first page will show a bunch of low level mixes so choose one were you can rank 1st.\n\nAfter I started doing that a lot of higher level challenges showed up! \n\nEven though you probably won\u2019t get all the special gifts, since people can play your mix now, you still can get cards and coins from another mixes (also help other players) and the game will be much more fun."

I've lived in the Lower Mainland my whole life and have heard \"goof\" used literally hundreds upon hundreds of times throughout my life. More than I can count. Probably because I've lived in Surrey my whole life. That probably explains why \ud83d\ude06.\n\nBut yeah, you'll always see some sort of altercation or quarrel between some random skids at Surrey Central or on the bus or SkyTrain. Not even just skids actually. Often skids though. You'll just hear \"Fucking goof!!!\" and then see someone pull out the bear spray and that's when you get the fuck out of there. \ud83e\udd23 \"Rat goof\" is another super common one used in a good old Surrey squabble. \"Squid\" as well. Or \"squid goof\". I like to say \"squid rat goof\" ironically sometimes because it's hilarious.\n\nA few years ago, a couple with a very tumultous relationship lived in one of the bottom flats in the building across from me in my apartment complex. They'd frequently get into quite a chaotic and disruptive lover's tiff, often in the middle of the night. They wouldn't hold back and would always bring it into the middle of the complex for everyone to hear. He'd kick her out and not let her back in or vice versa and either one of them would be pounding on the door, begging to be let back in. Or you'd just hear incessant screaming at each other and the throwing of objects and the shattering of glass. \"You're a fucking piece of shit goof! I hope you die!\"\n\nIt was super fun. Charming couple. Unfortunately, their stay here didn't last too long and their absence is definitely quite missed around here. Yeah, to my knowledge, the word is a term that is used in prison, only reserved for child molesters; the worst of the worst. So it's one of the worst things you could say to somebody. I rarely hear it used in a non-malicious manner. Recently I watched A Goofy Movie again for the first time since I was a child and every time they say \"goof\" in that movie, it just sounds so out of place and ridiculous to me because my brain automatically processes that word as a very offensive thing to call somebody. Doesn't offend me. Just that it's generally considered offensive.",

                "body": "I wish you luck.  Ambien isn't a commonly prescribed medication here in Canada. I don't even know if it's prescribed at all since I've never met or heard of another person here ever having tried it or even come across it. I've been trying to find it for years because I have chronic insomnia and the only things I've ever been prescribed for sleep are seroquel and trazodone. Those are pretty much the standard here for sleep. They're non-narcotics. Seroquel is an antipsychotic (that is prescribed off-label for sleep due to the extreme drowsiness it produces) and trazodone is an anti-depressant also prescribed off-label. \n\nThe closest thing to ambien here is zopiclone. It's also a Z-drug. Same class of drugs. It's considered a narcotic medication so It's schedule III here and I've almost always had to buy it illicitly online or from dealers since I can't ever get it prescribed to me. I've only had it prescribed to me for one night at the hospital last year when I couldn't sleep due to a very loud patient next to me coughing all night. Otherwise I've been taking it just about every night for the past couple years and it's only supposed to be used short term. I've ran out a few times and it's been pretty rough. So I understand what you're going through because since ambien and zopiclone are pretty similar, they can also give similar withdrawal symptoms on top of not being able to sleep.\n\nI finally found a local site last year that sells zolpidem but it's generic and definitely not pharmaceutical grade. It's basically made illegally. Zolpidem and zopiclone are the only two drugs out of everything I've ever tried that help me fall asleep every time. But I've only ever found the one site as a source for ambien and they charge $100 for thirty 10mg tablets. Just too expensive for me and the zopiclone costs me about $2.75 per 7.5mg tablet. Still a bit expensive but not as much as the ambien. If I had either prescribed to me, they'd be free because all mental health meds are free for low income people like me in Canada, you just have to apply for specific coverage called Plan G. I wish I could get a doctor to prescribe me either, but every doctor I've ever told about my insomnia only offers me seroquel or trazodone. They also have literally just prescribed me melatonin, which does fuck all for my insomnia. You don't even need a prescription for it because it's OTC and still costs the same amount of money either way. So pretty useless.\n\nThat's the thing about our free healthcare I never really hear people mention. It may be free, but the care given is often shit since doctors here make much less. Most doctors are often afraid to prescribe any meds that can be abused; they're much more cautious than doctors in the US. Which I guess is a positive thing, but for people like me who genuinely need certain medications, I just can't get them because I haven't found the right doctor.",

If I pass all of that and they actually still want to be my friend after me showing more of my true self, then I have to maintain said friendship otherwise it will eventually wither and die. I often just withdraw and won't talk to people for weeks and won't respond to messages.

I mean, I want to do those things, but I'm too broke to \ud83d\ude1d.\n\nI've often doubted being an ENFP because of how much I like to isolate. But I still need to hang out with my closest friends or go on some sort of an adventure to recharge. So that's how I know I'm not an introvert. I also have really bad social anxiety too. People who don't know me well or full on extroverts like ESFPs or ESFJs always think I'm an introvert. But my friends (who are literally all introverts) have no doubt I'm an extrovert. Being a 4w3, my Fi is really high so that's also caused me confusion with my type. But I'm definitely Ne dom. \n\nAlso oh god I'm sorry I just typed a whole wall of text at you \ud83d\ude05",

I saw staff wearing these green Christmas themed shirts that say \"Team Holiday\" and \"Old Navy\" on the front and an anthropomorphic dog (it looked like a golden retriever) on the back wearing clothes and shoes, walking, and giving the peace sign. I asked staff if they sell the shirt in stores and they said no. I really want this shirt and I'd be willing to buy one in medium off of anybody who has one. I guess once the holidays are over and you no longer need to wear it in stores. Please dm me, thanks"

Ron mentions to the police that $200 went missing as well as his bracelet. At around 33:33, Jeffrey denies knowing about any bracelet, while the camera briefly cuts to a shot of a severed forearm with a bracelet on it. This bit confused me. Can anyone please explain whose arm this is supposed to be? Is the bracelet supposed to be Ron's? Did Jeffrey for some reason take Ron's bracelet and put it on the severed arm of someone else?

It can reduce pain of both our trans people and \"gender non-conforming\" cis people, but it should never go to the way to obliterate trans validity.\n\nOr to say, it shouldn't be \"only biological gender matters\".

(Click on the cat after you click on the speaker). Buy all the tip jars you can first, as soon as you unlock them. Then buy some facilities that give you more tips per hour (a lot of buffet facilities do that), and upgrade the buffet in general, like the buffet recipes that will give you passive income that you can collect every 12 hours. Just in passive offline income, I get about 1.5m(x2 from ad) from the tip jar and 4.5m(+1m from ad) from the buffet every 12 hours, so about 17 million cod from offline income/day. I only have 2 tip jars left to unlock (one is locked to an event and the last one has a star requirement that I don't have yet). When you have atleast some of these things, then buy stuff that gives you passive online income too like barbecue (garden) for example, so you'll get more cod when you're online. I am currently focusing on getting all the recipes so I can unlock all the customers (which also gives you higher chances of getting higher paying customers too). Initially I focused on getting more stars, but when I had a good number of stars I started focusing on cod and film and recipes and other stuff. There are tips for getting more cod (or stars or film or whatever you want to focus on) on the wiki, which you will find if you click the link in the auto moderator comment under this post.",

I don't have one anymore and the prices are so out of range for me, I need to save up for that too and I'd like to have it in as less time as possible. A little amount of help, would do for me.\n\nAnd, um, thanks!"
