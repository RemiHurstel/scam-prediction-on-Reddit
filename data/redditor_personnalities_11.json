I have SEVERE depression and getting out of bed is next to impossible. I know I shouldn't fear or worry, I know God is going to take care of those that love him and keep his commandments. But like I said, I know I sin, I know I need to do certain things and stop doing other things. I want so bad to be a better Christian and mother, I am falling apart. I need guidance. I need to start reading my Bible and pray more. I need to start going to church again. This fear has got me frozen. All I do is worry about what these next few years hold. I don't want my kids to suffer, or me for that matter. I don't want us to be left behind when Jesus comes to rapture the church. I fear I will never be \"holy\" enough to get into Heaven and it scares me to my very core. I want to stop worrying. I want to be the Christian I know I can be. I want to be a better mother and talk more to my kids about Jesus. I have no family and no friends, so I'm incredibly isolated. It's been a bad night for me. So if you are reading this please pray for me. I need God's strength. Thank you."

I feel like I wasted/missed out on my \"high school experience\" bc freshman year was, to put it lightly, absolute hell, and since then I have been gradually trying to recover from that. In sophomore year I was diagnosed with Major Depression and General Anxiety Disorder. Just a year ago, I didn't think I would live to be 18, but I did. And now I genuinely want to live, but I feel like I am behind in life. (gifted kid burnout lol)\n\nAnd now I'm a senior, running out of time to figure out anything and, even though I have some ideas I don't know what I want to do or how to do them. Even though I am doing my best, it just isn't enough. I don't want to go to college, especially without knowing what I am doing it all for.\n\nI want to try modeling, but I don't know how to go about that, especially bc I am a curvy midsized person and I have (not very severe) sh scars all over my body.\n\nI want to be a real estate investor, but idk how the hell to go about doing that, especially considering money.\n\nI really want to be a fashion designer and own my own company (not just an Etsy shop), but I don't want to go to college if I can help it. I am considering fashion school, but idk if I should do online or in-person if I even decide to do it.\n\nI wish I knew now what I can do to prepare for my future. I wish I knew how to even begin to go about doing these things.\n\nI wish I knew how to deal with the fear that I will be unprepared and I will never get to do the things that make me actually have hope for my life.\n\nI should mention that my parents are okay with me living at home for a few extra years, but I don't want to stay a long time just because I don't know what I am doing with my life. And I hope I explained this alright.\n\nSome life advice would be nice."

This is ultimately a responsibility/culpability argument. You're making the claim that since children lack adult responsibility, they should be in sort of an untouchable category of gore-viewing. I don't think this argument is completely honest. There are tons of innocent adults who die in completely awful, undeserving ways, yet videos/photos of it still end up here, and I don't see you complaining about it.\n\nJust to be clear, I'm not shitting on your overall point of view, I just don't think you're being fully honest with it, which I want you to do. I'm aware that I'm making assumptions here, but I think the real reason this kind of thing makes you so upset is just your natural human reaction to the death of children. We can't explain it logically, but we all just feel extra bad when children die, don't we? Moreso than adults, even if adults die in equally horrific ways, and have human lives just as valuable as a child's, it still feels different. Why is that? It's just how we've conceptualized childhood vs. adulthood. Adults, *can* die, even if we don't want it to happen, or hate it when it happens, we understand it, because that's just something that happens to adults. Everyone dies sometime, and it's almost always during adulthood. Children, on the other hand, are different. In most people, there's just some underlying feeling of unease and disgust at the idea of a child dying, as if it's not something that's supposed to happen; it feels like a breach of natural law. We can't explain it; we just experience it. It just feels....*wrong*.",

I guess what I want to know is to what extent something can be considered an \"acceptable institution\" before it meddles with the free market. Things like voting, law-enforcement, separate branches of government etc... I can understand as strong institutions that still are independent of the economy.

I assume this is mainly just because of how tilted to the right the Overton Window has been in the US, making the \"center\" to the right of where it traditionally is.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/w0sres)"

The vast majority of biologists who study gender and sex affirm both the separation of sex and gender as well as the utility of affirming trans identity. Despite this, however, this talking point of denying biology seems to be one of the most resonant when it comes to reactionary content aiming for normie radicalization .  \n\n\nBut moving on from the conversations and talking points we all know too well, I think this points to a broader issue involving a disconnect between the scientific community and the common or \"normie\" understanding of the world. Obviously, with trans acceptance on the rise, this particular issue is definitely getting better. However, I just wanted to perhaps start some discourse relating to the overall role of science and scientists in leftist platforms. I think we should really lean in to it while trying to make it understandable to the average person."

                "body": "There is a phenomenon I and I'm sure many others here experience when faced with a task that has an upcoming due date. As per usual, we might procrastinate until our ever-present anxiety comes to the surface and we realize that it's pretty much do or die time with regards for our work; that if we don't work at that very moment, there's no probable chance that it gets in on time. Now, for me, this can go one of two ways. Either I hastily get the bare minimum done and hand it in (I say \"hand in\" loosely because this doesn't only apply to school assignments), or instead the phenomenon I mentioned earlier will occur. \n\nThis is how I describe it:\n\nIn order to soothe my anxiety, I will comfort myself with ideas in my head of finding time later to do whatever the task is. Of course, these ideas and aspirations are completely unrealistic, but just the idea of having that be a possibility is enough to quell my anxiety and suddenly any stress-induced motivation I had dissipates. A common example of one of these thoughts is the idea of getting up early the following morning to complete it, of getting it done when no one is awake and I have all the time in the world with minimal distractions. \n\nIt is a form of procrastination that is very dangerous because of its self-deceptive nature. In this situation where you are forced to confront the anxiety of fact that you don't have much longer to do something, your main goal is to get rid of the anxiety, not necessarily to do whatever the task is. Of course, doing the task is one way to get rid of the anxiety, which is why it is also a potential outcome. However, the alternative is just as if not more likely depending on the person. This is what I call \"Toxic Self Reassurance\".\n\nThe only real way I have found to counteract this is to find a way to care about a task beyond just the anxiety that not doing it brings. If you care about something, regardless of the anxiety, you are more likely to get it done for its own sake. As for ways of doing this, I've found that linking the task to something meaningful to you usually works (example: finishing a biology assignment because you want to be able to talk about what you've learned it with some family member).   \n\n\nI hope you found what I've said useful. Take care and peace out."

I don't have anyone to talk about how I'm feeling, what I'm thinking, what new little thing caught my interest. That's gone now. I always envisioned us as perfect for each other, always willing to drop anything for each other & be each others #1 supporters through life.\n\nAfter the breakup, she wanted to be friends but I couldn't do it. Every time I texted her, it was like texting somebody different. I wasn't talking to the girl I fell in-love with anymore. This girl didn't care about all the moments we shared, the promises we made or all the things we were building towards. This girl didn't care about me, didn't want to tell me about every little things going on in her life anymore. It was hard at first, but I decided to just delete her off everything and now I'm in the slow process of healing. As time has gone by, I can see how coldly she's treated me & I'm telling myself I deserve someone who wouldn't do that to me.",

(Sorry, I can't find the post, but if you know which post it is, feel free to share it). I was skeptical at first. I'm using an unlocked Galaxy s10e with VoLTE turned on, so I thought this couldn't be the problem. I flipped my VoLTE off & on to try to refresh it, because I really don't want to flash firmware on my phone. I'm immediately noticing a difference. It's only been one day so far, so I can't say the issue is gone, but I've gone from wifi to data multiple times with no issue. And this is on the default APN, not the [fast.t-mobile.com](https://fast.t-mobile.com) APN or various other APNs that I've been going through trying to find a solution.

Excellent colors & good contrast ratio, I think the black level on the monitor is pretty good. It had some slight backlight bleeding on the bottom right but nothing major. However, after a couple of weeks it developed [2 stuck pixels](https://imgur.com/oHYN5N8) that wouldn't go away. No problem, I just issued a replacement. Well the replacement came in & at first it seemed fine, until I noticed something. As i turned on the monitor the Nixeus logo appeared surrounded by a pitch black background & at the top left I see some [noticeable backlight bleeding](https://imgur.com/To2URoH). Almost as if that section of the monitor is being pinched or something. (the light that takes up the whole bottom right corner is due to the camera capturing a reflection or something, ignore it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis whole experience has left a somewhat sour taste in my mouth & I'm not sure if it's directed at Nixeus or just the state the monitor industry as a whole right now. I know panel lottery is a thing with these IPS panels but for this price point I really hate seeing these monitors be so problem prone. So I'm making this post to ask for advice & I'll start with a few points:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Has anyone here owned a Nixeus EDG monitor for close to a year? If so have you had any problems with the monitor? Should I go third times the charm & replace it once again?\n2. If I decide to try a different brand of monitor, which would you recommend. I was eyeballing the The Pixio PX7 Prime & the LG 27GL83A-B (which seems to be out of stock on Amazon unfortunately) before I bought the Nixeus but if you've owned a different monitor for a while & have had a good experience, feel free to drop a recommendation. I'm looking for 144hz 27\" freesynce/g-sync compatible monitors.\n3. Should I just accept the fact that this is where the monitor industry is right now & just use this backlight bleeding monitor? if I'm immersed in what I'm doing I don't notice it but If a dark screen pops up, it immediately jumps out & becomes an eye sore."

However she's the bread mother and will lug around bread whilst out drinking. So anyone that needs a piece of it to contain alcohol, she's it for the go to person.\" - Local Friend\n\n\"Good customer, but I dropped off food to one of her neighbor's residences instead since she misplaced the location. Neighbor declined since it was at the wrong location. I got free food though in the end, so that's definitely a win.\" - Grubhub Driver\n\n\"Too extroverted at times, likes to give nerdy, socially awkward guys like us a chance. Her moods can get erratic, overall has a beautiful soul.\" - Ex\n\n\"She will come up with the most far fetched ideas in her mind at the spur of the moment and turn it into plans that fall through. Will argue to death with you, and rebel against you. However she is good at convincing her ideas.\" - Mom\u00a0\n\n\"Yeah she's a hard worker, but she was actually late to work for 40 min because she forgot to bring a utensil with her food. However, she made it up by staying extra after her supposed clock out time to make up the work.\" - Ex-Boss\n\n\"Quirky woman, great to converse with, but hilariously awkward as she bugged me to ID a dead bed bug in the middle of an eyeglass store when I forgot my glasses. We didn't get kicked out, so that's the highlight of the day.\" - Discord Friend\n\nSounds great? Awesome!\n\nCar salesman: *slaps roof of the car* This bad boy can fit so much awesomeness and wholesomeness that even you would be proud of showing your new car off to your mother.\n\nIf interested, contact your local dealership about this fantastic deal and the receptionist will get back to you.

It provides both middle and high school education. (being a combination of HK\u2019s 6-year secondary education and the middle+high system)\n\nNoticing Shizume\u2019s initial solitude and inability to connect with others during her first year (Himeyuri\u2019s busy doing her own thing), Mayumi decided it\u2019s her responsibility to support Shizume. Shizume proceeds to look up to her, and is partially why she decides to actually try to leave an impact on Satsuki. \n\nShe has also adopted an [Askal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Askal) called Bruno, who has a bad habit of attacking the groin of everyone he meets, much to her chagrin. Bruno can also use the Stand. (\u201cIt\u2019s probably a defensive measure against those trying to bring harm to him.\u201d)\n\n\u201cSecond time I\u2019m Imae, I really like this role!\u201d - Deja\n\nAppearance: A red helium canister with a pair of spindly mechanical legs\n\nStats:\n* Power: D, not primarily for offence. \n* Speed: B, both the Stand and ability. \n* Range: A. \n* Durability: Stand is A, Ability is C. \n* Precision: C. \n* Potential: C. \n\nAbility: Balloonacy\n\nThe basic form of the ability is that Mayumi can summon balloons from the canister. \n\nThese balloons can be suspended in one spot if need be, and can hold the weight of one person holding it or standing on it, allowing them to be used as platforms. \n\nSince a balloon can support the weight of someone holding it, balloons that aren\u2019t suspended can be used for flight, a la the house from Up if there\u2019s enough balloons. For example, Mayumi can hold a bunch of them to fly, then as she reaches her destination she slowly releases balloons to descend. \n\nPeople standing on rising balloons don\u2019t lose balance, allowing the balloons to be used to gain vertical distance.\n\nThe balloons can hold small objects, properties and abstract concepts inside them, allowing Mayumi to, say, use her balloons to send messgaes. The max capacity of a balloon is 10L, so as long as it doesn\u2019t surpass the space of one Mayumi can put as many things as need be. Think of Caesar\u2019s Final Ripple holding his headband inside a bubble and Soft and Wet\u2019s Bubble Steal for this one (Do you know she can put a bunch of marbles inside the balloon to be used as a portable road trap?) Balloons with things inside them can still be used as platforms. \n\nIf I win I want next week\u2019s theme to be Stands named after Warner Bros music or media, given that JoJo\u2019s licensed by WB iirc."

When I got home I had a major caffeine overdose for a few hours (did not vomit) and felt like shit the next day.\n\nSince then I felt a weird downgrade in my appearance, particularly my overall facial structure. It seems that my face got noticeably thinner and \"smaller\". It really bothered me, and I thought it was from the caffeine overdose. Even now when I compare recent pictures to my pre-overdose pictures, I can't help but notice the consistent, slight downgrade in my appearance. Maybe I'm overly paranoid and it's just my imagination, but it really got to me and it still does to this day. I always thought this was from the caffeine overdose.\n\nHowever reading from online sources, I heard that a caffeine overdose doesn't leave any permanent damage, so I wondered wtf it was. Maybe just the long term effects of high stress? If it helps, I'm 18.\n\nI did some research about the Gfuel ingredients and found that Gfuel has lead, which makes me think that I have gotten lead poisoning from that incident. It says that you cannot recover from the damage done by lead.\n\nI have to ask, can a Gfuel overdose in the way I described lead to lead poisoning? Should I perhaps get myself tested, or is it too late for that? Is it even a possibility, or am I just being overly paranoid about everything? I simply can't shake off the noticeable downgrade in my looks, it's quite hard to handle. I really do hope I can get some helpful insights or answers to this problem.\n\nThanks for reading."

I chased him into a damp forest, shot him, and axed his back and kicked him in a puddle of water face first. I saw a young tribal guy near us see the scene and he screamed something (his dad?) and that's as far as I can remember. Could this mean anything about my past life or is it just my dream imagination?\n\nI also have recurring dreams of some kind of a \"zombie\" apocalypse in an urban theme-park resort kind of area and sometimes turning into a \"zombie\" later on in the dream. The dreams are usually thrilling and it feels extremely real all the time. Last night was especially intense, the first thought that popped into my mind as I woke up was that I was physically safe and I had the feeling of finishing a rollercoaster ride. This is a daily dream that's been going on for years. My overall experience with this kind of dream is that it's enjoyable, although scary. What could this mean? I don't watch many zombie movies and stuff but I am fascinated by the concept/subject. Could this point to anything related to my past life? Or is it just my teenage hormones as an 18 year old dude?"

And then some teacher goes to the center and talks about how the courses will be extremely difficult. After that all the students try to run out the front door but it closes on then and the teacher says that because their courses are already paid for they're not allowed to leave (this part makes me think it might actually be a private high school.) I remember there being this guy in his dorm room and a girl that visited him every once in a while because they were friends and she was good for nothing except cooking. Finally I remember there being an ecci scene where they were both in a small indoor swimming pool built directly into the tiles of the floor. Some teacher comes by and the dude has to hide underwater under the girl while she explains that she just wanted to take a dip at night."

Green being the most sour, yellow being medium sour, orange being mild sour, and then blue being \"cool\" (not sour at all).  They were square. Green, yellow, orange, and blue were the only colors they came in.  I tried Googling them, but all that came up were sour patch kids or warheads.  I don't think they were either of those.  Maybe they were a special variety back of those brands? I just remember getting them when I was younger (around 2005 or 2006)."

The topic of the stories our mothers used to read to us came up.  \n\nI remember my mom reading me a story where these two brothers were traveling far across the land and they were tired.  They soon come upon a village where they can rest.  They go around and ask for a bed to sleep in, but nobody in the town has a bed.  Eventually, the brothers decide to just sleep on the ground.  When they wake up, the whole town is gathered around them, looking shocked.  The brothers ask what the problem is and the townspeople said something like \"you were dead, but now you've come back to life?\"  The brothers explain that they were just sleeping and everyone in the village is confused.  They ask: \"sleep is not the same as death?\"  The traveling brothers say: \"no, when you sleep, you rise the next day.\" Then the town thanks the brothers as they leave.  \n\nThis is all I remember about the story (the details may not be accurate because this is a VERY distant memory). I bring this up here because my friend had never heard of it.  I searched the internet for it, but I couldn't find anything.  It has me wondering if I completely imagined it or if it's some Mandela Effect. Has anyone else ever heard of a story/folktale like this?  My family is Eastern European, so maybe it was an old Eastern European folktale?  This is probably a long shot, but I didn't know where else to ask."

We fell in love with the photos of Burlington we found online and are very excited to visit!  I was wondering if anyone here knew of any activities in the Burlington area that would be fun for two young adults.

I prefer boiled and/or microwaved hot dogs to grilled because all grilling does is dry them out (yes, even if you\u2019re a grill master, any amount of charring is drier than a microwaved hotdog).

I loved the characters, the action, the story, the subtext and symbolism around the changers\u2014everything, and I couldn\u2019t understand why people didn\u2019t like it.\n\nThen I realized, I\u2019ve been listening to the audiobooks of the Culture series, not reading the print editions. And if you haven\u2019t listened to the audiobooks, you don\u2019t know that they\u2019re read by one of the BEST audiobook narrators I\u2019ve personally ever experienced. His voice adds SO much character and dynamism to the story. He brings a lot of life to every single character, and he adds a lot of great tension to scenes that would otherwise be stagnant.\n\nSo, if you hate *Consider Phlebas*\u2014or just have difficulty with any of the books in general\u2014check out the audiobooks. And also another quick tip if you\u2019re American: the narrator has a fairly thick accent and speaks fast so you might want to consider slowing it down to .75x speed, but that may just be me! Seriously, check them out, some of the best audiobook experiences I\u2019ve ever had."

She's in school three hours 5 days a week FFS. Even if I leave her for lunch that's 5 hours and way more expensive and it doesn't take into account that she's been off with various daycare hellviruses for three weeks out of the past 4. So I'm supposed to have done all this shit during her nap time or something? \nAnd he has the cheek to ask why I'm not doing my old hobbies (running and painting) anymore. \n\nWHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK MAN?!\n\nShe's also not sleeping, I think her adenoids are swollen again so I'm going to speak to the doctor about a cycle of nasal steroids (worked for a friend's kid) so we're both tired and grouchy but I just need some reassurance that I'm not crazy and that these expectations are a bit...

I mean it happens to adults too, when you really don't fancy a particular thing you'll eat it if you have to but if there's an alternative you make something else right? So I know they say just let them skip it but even though my daughter generally eats well she tends towards skinny like my MIL, not unhealthy in general but on the smaller side, despite being tall like my husband and I. She also gets sick fairly regularly (yay, daycare \ud83d\ude2d) so I don't like to let her skip meals when she's feeling well. She got down to 20th percentile weight for 90th percentile height this summer and the paediatrician yelled at us basically, even though we were offering food all the time she was just not feeling well and didn't want to eat\n\n\nSo anyway, what I've been doing is if she doesn't want/like something I always have an alternative in the fridge, like tonight she didn't want her pasta with broccoli cream so I got out a can of sweetcorn and some sweet potato and chickpea curry that I made tonight for my husband and me (I initially made her a separate meal because of the spices but she seems to like it). Is this the wrong thing to do? She's eating quite happily now but I know that what I've been doing is not what's generally advised."

I work part time at a hotel doing Night Audit, but my full time job that I worked tonight is front desk/ security at a facility designed to help the homeless get back on their feet. We have temporary and permanent residents. It can get a bit crazy here at times because all of the residents are 5150 aka mental health struggles.\n\nSo it\u2019s about 3:20AM and I\u2019m playing Steam Deck while simultaneously \u201cwatching the cameras\u201d when I hear a fire alarm going off. I go outside of the office to investigate and I\u2019m greeted by the wife who states there\u2019s a fire in her house and she doesn\u2019t know what to do. I begin to dial 911 on my cellphone but I decide to get more information before I call them. Because of the nature of this job, emergency services is very aware of this location and I\u2019m on a first name basis with the cops. Pretty much they don\u2019t really like us and sometimes the residents call wolf when there\u2019s no emergency so I want to make sure it\u2019s legit and we really need them. (I once had a resident tell me there were zombies coming from under the floor despite him living on the 2nd floor as well as another resident last week tell me someone snuck into her room and replaced her bleach with water).\n\nThe location where I work is a motel converted into apartments so as I reach the area near their unit I can immediately smell smoke. The husband is still inside combating the situation. It\u2019s company policy for us not to enter the unit, but because of the emergency, I enter anyway. The husband is in the kitchen and the pot is engulfed in flames. He\u2019d already taken the pot off of the burner and turned off the burner. I instructed him to find the lid. After some searching, he found the lid and put it on the pot extinguishing the flames almost immediately. I instructed the residents to wait outside until all the smoke cleared\u2026 and crisis averted."

He briefly got out to check something and the smell went with him so I know it\u2019s not in the car and actually him.\n\nSome background is he\u2019s a pretty young guy mid 20s and is pretty obese. We went on a partial foot patrol and I went up one flight of stairs and he commented he doesn\u2019t do stairs and will only use the elevator. I noticed he gets winded just from walking and breathes pretty heavily.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell him he smells like \ud83d\udca9.\n\nTldr: boss smells like \ud83d\udca9 and i don\u2019t know how to tell him"

Also the War mentioned at the end would have really made the book more interesting if it was only actually IN the story .

Religions like some forms of Buddhism do not have a deity they worship, but I believe it\u2019s not that they actively reject the existence of a god, it\u2019s more that their beliefs do not include a god. If that makes sense. So the logic behind a true religious atheist would be the same logic behind any religious individual. \n\nWhat my question was seeking the in the first place was the active  rejection of the existence of a god while the acceptance of other \u201cnon objectively true\u201d beliefs. This may sound like an oxymoron or a rare occurrence, but I would guess that there are a fair amount of people that do not believe in organized religion or a god, but do believe in an afterlife, reincarnation and/or karma.\n\nPS: the title is meant to be a hook."

But also a bummer because now we won't have Tony Stark matching intellect alongside Reed Richards or Steve Rogers fighting alongside Wolverine in WWII or saving young Magneto. Just no Iron Man and Steve Rogers the rest of the MCU? And are we eventually just not going to have Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, Doctor Strange, Ant Man, and Spider-Man when those actors leave? They're adding The X-Men and the Fantastic Four but I'd rather they be together with older characters, not replacements.\n\nBut NWH showed alternate universe versions can be different actors. I know people think no one else could be Tony Stark or Steve Rogers but when they were first cast people were skeptical and look how that turned out? It can happen again.  \nAnd maybe Tony can be more comic accurate, more a playboy, more serious, more selfish. And maybe his version didn't reveal his identity yet and with Tony Stark dead in the MCU he could still be secret. I know they're bringing in Iron Heart but it's not the same just because she's a person with a similar suit. And Iron Man still came back in the comics too.  \nSince Falcon is Captain America at the moment Steve Rogers could be Nomad and not reveal who he really is yet (it would be great if Chris Evans came back as he said he might if the story was good but an alt universe version is still better than none).\n\nI watch the MCU for the characters, not just the actors, so I'd rather characters be different actors than not around at all, right? Especially as more actors eventually retire out. What do you think? Get new blood or let the MCU shrink?"

At my airline, you start off with a minimum of 12 days off per month. Some schedules give you 16 days off a month (during non-peak travel times of the year). One reason I love this job is that I feel like I\u2019m actually living life, both at work, and in my off time. At work, I\u2019m out in the world, interacting with real humans, rather than stuck behind a computer in an office. On days off, I can travel, run errands, sleep in, stay up late, hang out with friends, explore the city, pursue creative expression, work out, meal prep \u2026 It\u2019s the first job I\u2019ve had where I actually feel like I have sufficient free time to do adulting as well as stuff I enjoy.\n\nMost airlines have a minimum age of 20 or 21 to apply.

I believe the root causes are these:\n\n* Irregular sleep pattern / insufficient sleep for the level of exertion and jet lag\n* Irregular eating schedule, due to not always having time to eat when you are hungry (then feeling ravenous when you actually do have time)\n* Feeling a buildup of stress, and a desire to release it through exercise, but lacking physical energy to do so\n* Insufficient hydration\n\nI have been meal prepping, and bringing a lot of nutritious meals and snacks, but the problems above are still consistent.

Anyway, her boyfriend also had depression and anxiety so she thinks spending every breathing second with him is a good idea, but we won't talk about that. \n\nSo from around that March when they started dating to May when they had become more serious, her boyfriend cheated on her and she found out while he was in the hospital at one point and he couldnt have his phone so she looked at it and found some texts. She completely forgave him for it, and made excuses for him. Look, I never dated anyone yet, but I sure as hell am not stupid. I hate when people don't hold themselves to a higher standard. \n\nNot long after, I get informed by my best friend, who didn't want to even tell me in the first place, that her boyfriend asked her to marry her. Of course she knows me well enough to already know my opinion in the subject, but as much as me and another mutual friend try to tell her not to do it, she doesn't want to hear it.\n\nThere could be a whole list of reasons for them to not get married (like the fact he cheated real bad, they're way too young--that has a lot of reasons within itself), it's just too bad some people don't care to obtain that kind of common sense. So I know they're probably gonna get married sometime soon and she would 9.9/10 expect me to be there, but I'm not about to go to something I don't support and think is just stupid and poor judgement...does anyone think differently?"

Never have I felt as sad and unmotivated to warrant the label \"depressed until that point. I had never felt worse, and I needed a change. And I decided that I was gonna find some goals to really pour everything I have into. Because for me right now, there's nowhere to go but up. So I'm gonna start a workout routine!\n\nI'm starting a 3-day split total body workout, that I hope to keep going for as long as possible (minimum 4 months). I'm doing this to gain some muscle mass and strength, and to be clear, the last thing I want is to lose weight. My doctor's have been telling me for years that I am underweight for my height and age. For reference, I'm 17 years old, male, 6ft 2, small frame and I'm 130 lbs.\n  \nI also plan on starting a diet that's at least healthy. My diet so far has primarily been processed, packaged foods, as they're the cheapest options, and...well...they taste pretty good too. I wouldn't say I have an addiction to things like junk food, but I do eat it on a fairly regular basis. \n\nObviously there's going to be some big changes in my life to achieve this goal, and I'm still not very familiar with all of this, and so I'm asking you to help and guide me in any way you can on my personal journey. Any tips, pointers, techniques, changes, or even just a little motivation is wholeheartedly appreciated. I can't wait to see how this goes, and how far I can go to be the best I can be.\nThank you for reading, once again, I apologise for the long post."

The one I've known for the longest time actually. \n\nI knew the guy since grade 1, maybe even longer, and we just so happened to go to the same high school. He's been a part of my close friend group in middle school and when high school started 3 years back, he joined my new group. He's easily one of the best friends I've got. And he's...very openly homophobic. Like, to the point where he will directly harass people he thinks are gay when he gets the chance.\n\nNow, he and I both had a very similar upbringing in life, both being brought into a religious lifestyle at a very early age. And where I deviated from the path that my parents set out for me, he clung to it. He won't bring up Christianity too often, and he certainly doesn't act like a nice and clean religious kid. But the moment that anything LGBT related comes up, it's like a switch flips in his head, and he goes into attack mode.\n\nHe was always one to be blunt in the way he speaks, which normally is fine. But when he goes into his \"attack mode\", that bluntness turns into a real issue. He will throw anything out there if it paints the LGBT community in a bad light. He just directly doesn't like them.  \n\nAnd while this is obviously an issue, my worries come from my tolerance of his homophobia. I mean, I try to stop any arguments he tries to start. But besides that, I just sort of see it as something that he just...does. I don't take any offence to it, even if it's directly aimed at me. I've never really been one to make a big deal of things, ever since I started high school, but I'm concerned that this is an issue that should be addressed.  \n\nIt's not just with him either. Like, anyone whether I know them or not, I'll accept what they say to me. It could be direct hate towards me or the community or just a random negative comment on something related, and I'll just take it.\n\nFor example, there was one day where I was riding on public transportation, and this random guy leans in and tells me \"that outfit makes ya look kinda gay, ya know.\" And I could tell in his tone, that to him that was a problem. And I just...took it. Nothing thrown his way. Not even a single response at all. I thought of what I could say, but nothing ever happened. \n\nWould you call this an issue?\n\n\n\nSorry if there are any errors in this, first time making a text post."

Only thing I would question is that one of the most popular surnames in Ukraine is \u201cMelnik/Melnyk\u201d which means miller. If this is so, then how would Milicki/Mil\u00edczky/\u041c\u0456\u043b\u0456\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439\u201d relate to that then?\n\nAlso in Ukrainian, I think the word for \u201cgrind/mill\u201d is \u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438 (Moloty) so if there would be a name based off this, wouldn\u2019t it be \u201cMolocki/\u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439\u201d? \n\nI\u2019m definitely open to your theory as it makes lots of sense and the area they were from, Halych, was a very diverse place at the time.",

The name \u201cMil\u00edczky\u201d being Hungarian is likely because that was from the records of it from Slovakia. It actually got changed from Mil\u00edczky to Mel\u00edczky when they moved to Slovakia, and then it became anglicized to Melitski in America, so it\u2019s kinda confusing. I have no idea if the name is Polish, Ukrainian, Slovak, or something else but the \u201cski\u201d sound at the end leads me to believe it is Polish.\n\nI think it is less likely to mean \u201cnice\u201d like \u201cmi\u0142y\u201d because there was never a mark on the L in the name like there is in mi\u0142y.\n\nAlso what makes it confusing is that that region my ancestors are from has been very culturally diverse. There are Ukrainians, Poles, Rusyns, Slovaks, etc. who have been under many different empires such as Poland, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Ukraine, etc.",

Are they the same or similar?\n\nI find that when I do the back trill I can\u2019t really use it in words or sentences and that I can only functionally use it if it\u2019s at the beginning of a word. Even then, it takes a quick second to get my mouth in that position, and sometimes I don\u2019t get it first try as well. \n\nAny tips or advice for how I can pronounce the Spanish R/alveolar trill?"

                "body": "Since its been something of a hot topic over the last few weeks, I'd quite like people's take on public transport and congestion, because I see a lot of negativity to the planned improvement in public transport across South Cambridgeshire in the 'commuter belt' so there'll be loads more buses at \u00a31 fares (or \u00a32 if coming from further afield), lots of negativity towards the congestion problem in Cambridge, lots of negativity towards the state of Cambridge's roads in terms of potholes etc, and despite this the most anger and vitriol is reserved for the proposed sustainable travel zone charge.\n\nSo I don't quite get it. Is it that everyone knows congestion and the ensuing poor state of the roads is a problem but fuck it, let's let it get worse or \"its not my problem\"? Because I suspect many of us have been to Amsterdam and have noticed how easy it is to get around using either bikes or public transport and that's not an accident - actually Amsterdam was plagued by congestion in the 50s and 60s. In response they prioritised cycling and and made it say that car drivers would have to go go on much longer and much less direct route to get where they're going. They prioritised pedestrians and cyclists so that Amsterdam is an easy and pleasant place to walk or cycle around and pretty generally this seems to have had the intended effect and Amsterdam is renowned as a place where cyclists can easily get places, where public transport is easy and efficient to use, and even where driving isn't as big a hassle as it is elsewhere.\n\nSo when we know that making cycling and public transport easier does work to reduce traffic, when the local government here is introducing a much improved public transport network that there's a lot of support for making it actually a publicly run service (i.e. not for profit) that will be cheap, extensive and frequent, when Cambridge is very easy to cycle around topographically like much of the Netherlands, when pretty much everyone hates sitting in traffic, when pretty much everyone wants cleaner air, why is there so much negativity towards improving the bus network, maybe *actually* using the bus and implementing the sustainable travel zone charge to pay for it? If we don't implement the charge, how do we pay for it and what's the alternative? How do we reduce traffic and pollution when Cambridge grew by 17% over the last 10 years and will probably continue to grow?"

In the middle a bar is going horizontally across the gate with tenons going into mortises on the stiles so if you can imagine it will look like a boxy 8.\n\nI've got tongue and groove boards to go on the front and close it up, and I was going to rout a rabbet the boards where the 'lock rail' is going and have a rabbet on the top and bottom rail so the board sit flush into the frame but now I'm a little concerned that this will weaken the mortise and tenon joints/the wood where the mortises are.

It's not that i hate this game but I cannot imagine playing it without a mods and it should not be this way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow you can find my wishlist but don't be shy and share what you have in mind!\n\n1. Editable Ceiling - meaning you can paint it. \n\n2. Editable wall hights, doors, windows for apartments. I was surprised that this was not an update prior to Industrial Kit - where the heck should i use it - i think only in penthouses? What about apartments. \n\n3. Editable/accessable balcony for Eco Lifestyle.\n\n4. Having option to add new apartments - but i doubt they will add it, it's a feature that usually convinces people to buy a pack \\[at least it's quite important to me\\] - we don't have so many apartments. Especially small appartments. Or at least having option to formally separate existing one so from 1 you can have 2 or 3. \n\n5. Bikes for kids, cars, other transportation + garages. \n\n6. Likes/Dislikes update - we don't have some activities there + they should use it for attraction system/chemistry - i know that Wonderful Whims adds those \\[+ you can add more than 20 just by doing it in Live Mode by accessing Wonderful Whims menu\\]. \n\n7. LGBT update - like picking up your gender, sexuality. We have a great LGBT mod but i want this to be part of base game - it should go together with new aspirations/update to the politician career \\[LGBT activist\\]. To add some drama there should be also negative traits like transphobic to spicy up the game and make it more realistic - so we can convience sims and educate them so maybe they will change their attitude. Plus additional events and activities for the clubs related to LGBT like coming outs \\[this is really covered in LGBT mod so if you don't have it - grab it asap!\\]. \n\n8. Memories. We really should have memories - so memories overhaul for base game + packs.\n\n9. Game progression - which you can turn on/off - so sims will have their lives, goals, careers, completing aspirations etc. Same with relationships: they should change & be linked to attraction system."

However, I think that in a vacuum, the act of reproduction is not really selfish, because it's natural? I feel like it's the same as calling the desire to be in a relationship selfish. In theory, sure, but they're just things that are fulfilling to a lot of people.

It's not just random! We need to admit...\n\nOur sexuality is defined by the stages of the moon. If the moon is waxing, well so our are hearts for the opposite sex. And if it's waning, then our same-sex friends are the ones we'll be dating. It's that simple, and I just wish we could be fully ourselves out there.

The newer bands always tend to have more discourse about them than the older ones and while that kinda sucks, it's also understandable.

These villains could possibly destroy an infinite amount of lives and that is too, *too* much for the average viewer to understand. Of course their powers go under-utilised, they're too powerful for their own good.\n\nAnother thing I hated in the movie was how MODOK was handled, especially his death.

But I don't actually think that this means I miss out on things, in fact, I already feel like the game offers a lot more content than what I'll ever be able to access.\n\nTF2 is a massive game, just take a look at how many official maps there are. I don't think I've even played on all of them and that's not even mentioning how many community servers are out there that offer completely different game modes. And when it comes to weapons, there's an abundance of them as well. Most players usually stick to 1-2 loadouts per class, imagine how many alternative playstyles you're missing out on. And do I even have to talk about hats and other cosmetics?\n\nPoint is, there's an incredible amount of content that TF2 has to offer and most players probably haven't taken a deep dive to see all of it. There's enough content for who knows how many thousands of hours of gameplay and that's more than what we can juggle anyway.\n\nWhen it comes to the community, the amount of players constantly increases. TF2 is still extremely popular, even if we don't hit numbers like Fortnite or CS, it's always on the top of Steam charts and it always gets talked about. I mean, just look at this sub: nearly 800k subscribers? That's a ridiculous amount of people. TF2 is still far, far from dying and it doesn't need to get updated to pull in those numbers.\n\nWe may eventually run out of things to talk about, but there's always new fanart that gets posted, new memes that get created and the TF2 community is changing constantly as well, as time goes on. We don't need new updates from Valve to keep the game alive and that's been proven countless times already. And to be honest, looking back at past updates, a major update that would get dropped in the near-future could effectively destroy the game and nerf countless weapons as well.\n\nScream Fortress and Smissmas are supported by the community and their efforts, but that's not a bad thing anyway. Workshop creators are a lot more in-touch with what the average TF2 player wants and needs than devs that may or may not be working on the game, so I don't think we should be so disappointed that Valve doesn't do things. Of course, it would be nice if the comics got finished, but apart of that and the Heavy update, I don't think Valve has \"unfinished business\".\n\nTF2 is not outdated. There may be several things that should be fixed, but even with these faults, the game is still standing and still has an extremely loyal fanbase. The lack of updates isn't the huge catastrophe that will eventually kill all of us, as a lot of people make it out to be, it's more like a simple inconvenience in the grand scheme of things. So we should treasure the time we have on it, before some underpayed dev drops an update that completely wrecks everything we have going on."

I grew up in a busy area filled with cars, but very limited public transportation, so I wasn't allowed outside alone.

Where else could I have turned to, if \\*not\\* the Internet?\n\nI used to be a huge bookworm, but once I discovered the Internet everything was over. I had unlimited access, of course, since noone in my family knew what kind of trash I could find here. I started from harmless Flash games, but eventually ended up scrolling through shitty meme sites, like 9gag and iFunny, but the final nail in the coffin was when I ended up on Reddit and 4chan. My biggest regret is how I let my young brain be molded by the absolute insane opinions that are on places like this. I had also seen too many things at an age where I shouldn't even have had a concept of them that are completely disgusting and very damaging, especially for a child.\n\nI recognised what the problem was fairly early on, but I could never manage to do anything about it. I tried every method I could think of, but at the end of the day, I had nothing to do instead of mindlessly browsing the Internet, so I turned back every single time.

You had to add different elements/items to the game (like fire or seeds and stuff), maybe 10 in total, and if you found the right order, the cube turned into a livable place for the little human.\n\nThe main point of the puzzle was finding the right order, for example if you placed the seeds too early and tree grew out of it, when you picked the fire later on, then the whole place burned down.\n\nI know that the developer had several similar puzzle games. The other one I remember had the same goal as this one, ecxept you had to build a tower and find the correct order to place different levels.\n\nPlatform(s): Browser-based game, most likely Flash, but could be Html\n\nGenre: Puzzle, logic\n\nEstimated year of release: early 2010's possibly\n\nGraphics/art style: Minimalistic 2D graphics. The art style was somewhat distinct and featured a lot of wacky elements. The animations werer very detailed and the game itself was colourful and a bit over-the-top\n\nNotable characters: Little white human-like figure\n\nNotable gameplay mechanics: You added different elements/items to the cube every round and the little human used them to build stuff. The goal was to find the perfect order\n\nOther details: The game was pretty comedic, as I said a lot of wacky elements and mechanics were added. Sometimes the outcome of placing an item after another was not excepted at all. The humour was similar to something like the Henry Stickmin games"

Every social event is based on drinking, every time we hang out, we somehow end up in a bar and every time I say that this time I'll drink lightly, I end up downing more shots than anyone else.\n\nI just feel pathetic for not being able to say no. I'm so envious of others who are able to tell \"no, sorry, I'll skip this party\" or \"no, thanks, I don't like alcohol\". I can never do it, no matter how hard I try.\n\nIt is always so bad to take the bus alone after drinking. Or to wake up the next day with horrible back pain and swollen eyelids. I can't hide that I've been drinking and I'm always scared that something horrible will happen to me when I'm drunk that I won't be able to escape from, yet I still can't say no. I see more drunks on the streets than dogs, I saw a guy's immune system collapse from alcohol, another one have his mind slowly rot away, yet they continue and so do I.\n\nI just want to go back in time and un-invent alcohol. Every time I take a sip, I regret it, but I still do it the next time out of FOMO or whatever. I promised I'll stay sober this whole semester, but guess what? I failed already."

You could connect with the guy who built it to see how he dealt with the privacy laws and things.\n\nI really think you should go the reverse job board route. The domain fits much better that way.\n\nAlso, look into offering education and career advice/resources. Maybe you could partner with a course provider and promote/resell their courses? Great way to build traffic, offer value, and/or increase revenue.

Even Google Reviews struggles with the this. And, you're right, I don't think you necessarily need to have an answer to be successful. After all, people use and rely on sites like Yelp and Glassdoor just fine even though they they don't have any real way to ensure integrity. Though, arguably, they do have numbers on their side.\n\nI just asked because I've had similar ideas in the past, and this issue of integrity is always glaringly problematic, especially when you start to think about how the site would be monetized. So, yeah, was just wondering if maybe you'd come up with some novel solution.\n\nI think your tactic of using verification is pretty sound, but if you haven't found a way to monetize that might become expensive in terms of processing and moderating the intake. And, like you said, there are liability considerations. Maybe you could have the companies shoulder the responsibility? For example, you could charge companies to create and maintain their profiles, then they can introduce their employees to the platform and self-verify? It would introduce new problems like why would companies join in the first place, and how would alleviate fear from employees who want to write negative or critical reviews, but atleast you have monetization and moderation solved...\n\nOne solution I've seen is: (https://www.vcguide.co/). They use an invite-only method to let founders review their investors. Another is: (https://www.theplayerstribune.com/). They're a completely different type of site/business, but they work with athletes to publish long form articles. So they build direct relationships and use their connections/network to deliver authentic content. So yeah, maybe you can get some ideas/inspiration from those and other sites like that.\n\nAnyways, just shooting the shit. I think what you're doing is cool and it would be useful to alot of people.

As far as I know, she's been going to these meetings for more than 5 years and apparently she's somewhat of a personality. She frequently does speeches and had a few important posts at it. Yet,  she's a fraud. You see, she didn't really had a drinking problem to begin with and she has never, ever, tried to repair the past. I know it's part of the steps, because she recites them to everyone whenever she cans, she has these telephone  conferences with some of her godchildren where she imparts her wisdom as how this program is important and they are still trapped in their old ways. She always yells it so anybody at home could miss it... \n\nI guess I always wondered if she was going to come back and apologize (?) Or maybe it was this inner voice telling me she really thinks she has nothing to apologize for. Not to me, at least. Now that I think about it, I really doubt that she has apologized to anyone in my family. Not without tears  in her eyes and some lie about her health to make us feel sorry for her. That's not how you make amends, not to hoard sympathy and make yourself the victim. \n\nThis also seems really whining from me, because it shows I'm hurt and that I still expected something out of her. But I know this, she's still pretending. And this has nothing to do with AA. I know their program and mission, you see I listened. If anything I feel sorry my mother has another chance to smear something that might be really helpful to others. I know, for instance, she specifically takes posts that manage some money, so her lifestyle doesn't suffer (even when she remains unemployed). I'mpretty sure those confessionals haven't include how she usually does the same time after time: at her former church, my siblings' school boards . So, even when I'm not expecting an apology, I'm still dreading that  panicked reunion where she will demand us the missing money.  (That's why never should take gifts/ favors from a narcissist).\n\nI feel petty and mean lately, bringing out my receipts.  But, I realized I feel worse for being my mom box of secrets. That's her shame, not mine. Yet, I feel I cannot really talk about it.  I see my family nembers recoiling from me. I see them questioning her and she calling me a liar, telling them I am prejudiced and crazy. \"Oh she forgets things, she's so neurotic\". She's always telling me, how I'm going to end up like her, how I'm not crazy, yet. And they believe her. Even when she had stole from them, abuse them and lie to them. So that's how I find myself today, I've lost my sense of rightfulness and now I feel alone and trapped."

During this time I've finally discovered what was wrong with my relationship with my mom. Which is funny since I've always known she has a bipolar disorder diagnosis; yet, I never thought how that might affect the rest of the family. We've been basically living around this toxic cloud around us, secretly wondering if something was wrong with us! That's how this \"people\" operate... It's sickening . \n\nAnyhow, I've been struggling to keep minimal contact with her, trying to heal until I can finally get out . This was until yesterday when I found out she took all the money I've been saving. I know it was her. I don't have a reason to doubt my siblings, in fact I know this is nothing new in this household since they often find they are as well missing money. \n\nI tried to confront her, but yeah the gaslighting began .. how dare I to accuse HER , my own mother. How I'm surely cursed, because I'm so terrible with her. How everyday I'm worse and she pities me for it. At these moments, I can't stop from feeling devastated and unwillingly I start questioning my memory because \"I surely misplaced the money and I'll be so sorry\". \nI've had very bad post gaslighting experiences in the past where I've been really close to a nervous collapse. Therefore, I find this situation extremely triggering. I've been exercising and doing yoga so I can help my brain to unwind but I wish I could do something else . I've been searching for some supplements that might help maybe you have some suggestions ? Right know, therapy is not really an option for me, unless I can find a job and start saving to get out again. I'm now aware that is not a place where I can feel safe and any little gesture I can achieve is a step forward. "

While it's absolutely possible for someone to directly place themselves in environments or situations that lead to and worsen depression/anxiety, doing that is absolutely not necessary for someone to have depression. It's both psychological and physical, which is a brutal combination.\n\nHave you ever needed to do something, wanted to do it, but for some reason you just couldn't? Like your brain said \"no\" despite everything (including your own self interest) saying \"yes\"? That's executive dysfunction, and there's not much someone can do to seriously fight it beyond waiting for it to go away and not making it worse. Depression is similar. If someone is depressed and normally art makes them happy, there's a possibility when they engage in said art they just won't feel any better. Even while trying their best to say \"yes\" and be happier their brain simply won't allow it, and sometimes it feels like a losing battle against their own mind. Compound this with the fact depression also influences executive function (meaning even the act of doing small things to get better is a challenge) and it becomes increasingly obvious that blaming victims of mental illness for their illness is nothing short of unfair.\n\nYes everyone plays their part in their own health, but a sprained ankle still needs crutches much like a depressed person still needs a support system. They're doing their best, even if their best doesn't look so good right now. Hope this helps, much love \u2764\ufe0f",

I'd honestly love to know if there's a way to induce them because when I get the mood swings it's a lot harder to tell if I'm actually on my period, so some physical response would be great.\n\nMuch love \u2764\ufe0f"

Bu sadece g\u00fclmeye verdi\u011fimiz anlamdan kaynaklanan bir ill\u00fczyondur.\n\n          Tickle torture 3 \u015fekilde yap\u0131labilir. Birincisinde ba\u011flanan ki\u015fi ba\u015fka birisi taraf\u0131ndan elle g\u0131d\u0131klan\u0131r ve en az efektif olan budur. \u0130kincisinde ki\u015fi bir t\u00fcy yard\u0131m\u0131yla g\u0131d\u0131klan\u0131r. \u00dc\u00e7\u00fcnc\u00fcs\u00fcnde ise ki\u015finin v\u00fccudunun belli bir b\u00f6lgesi tuzlan\u0131r ve bir ke\u00e7i yard\u0131m\u0131yla ki\u015fi g\u0131d\u0131klan\u0131r. Bu ke\u00e7inin dil yap\u0131s\u0131ndan dolay\u0131 en etkili y\u00f6ntemdir. Ba\u015fta masum g\u00f6r\u00fcnen g\u0131d\u0131klama, Naziler taraf\u0131ndan dahi kullan\u0131lm\u0131\u015ft\u0131r. Ayn\u0131 \u015fekilde \u0130ngilizler de bu y\u00f6ntemi ki\u015finin v\u00fccudunda iz b\u0131rakmamak istediklerinde kullanm\u0131\u015flard\u0131r. Bilgi olarak daha \u00e7ok \u015fey eklenebilir fakat benim odaklanmak istedi\u011fim nokta bunun alt metnidir. \n\n          \u0130ki ayr\u0131 kavram\u0131n anlamlar\u0131n\u0131n birbiri ile etkile\u015fimi her zaman ilgi \u00e7ekici bir konu olmu\u015ftur. G\u00fclmek ve i\u015fkence, haz ve ac\u0131, nefret ve sevgi... Beynimizin bu kavramlara dair bir g\u00f6r\u00fcnt\u00fcleri vard\u0131r ve bu g\u00f6r\u00fcnt\u00fcler birbiri ile uyu\u015fmaz fakat yine de bir araya getirilebilir. Bu da olay\u0131 daha da etkileyici yapar. Kavramlardan almak istedi\u011fimiz sonu\u00e7lar farkl\u0131d\u0131r fakat tam tersi bir sonu\u00e7 elde ederiz. Beynimiz bunu kabul etmek istemez ve olumlu resme odaklanmak ister. Sonucun ger\u00e7ekli\u011fini kabul etmez ve bunu farkl\u0131 bir mant\u0131\u011fa s\u0131\u011fd\u0131rmaya \u00e7al\u0131\u015f\u0131r.

G\u00fclmek mutluluk, e\u011flence, g\u00fczel ili\u015fkiler, zevk, arkada\u015fl\u0131k, rahatl\u0131k kavramlar\u0131n\u0131 bize \u00e7a\u011fr\u0131\u015ft\u0131r\u0131r. Resim kesinlikle olumludur ve bizi rahatlat\u0131r. \u0130\u015fkence ise ac\u0131, zarar verme, a\u015fa\u011f\u0131lama, korku, \u00e7aresizlik, \u00f6l\u00fcm gibi kavramlar\u0131 bize \u00e7a\u011fr\u0131\u015ft\u0131r\u0131r.

Beyne giden duyusal y\u00fcklenme \u00e7ok fazla oldu\u011fundan g\u0131d\u0131klama bir s\u00fcre sonra \u00e7ok ac\u0131 verici bir s\u00fcrece d\u00f6n\u00fc\u015f\u00fcr. V\u00fccudumuzun kald\u0131rabilece\u011fi bir limit vard\u0131r ve bu limit g\u0131d\u0131klama s\u00fcrd\u00fck\u00e7e a\u015f\u0131l\u0131r. \u00d6zellikle ke\u00e7i ile yap\u0131ld\u0131ysa, ke\u00e7inin dili deriyi inceltmeye ba\u015flar ve bu da ac\u0131y\u0131 artt\u0131r\u0131r. Ki\u015finin e\u011fer kalp rahats\u0131zl\u0131klar\u0131 varsa kalp krizinden \u00f6lme ihtimali vard\u0131r ve bu sebeple g\u00fclme ve \u00f6l\u00fcm kavramlar\u0131 yan yana gelmi\u015f olur. \n\n          Son olarak hepsini \u00f6zetlemek gerekirse tickle torture'da di\u011fer i\u015fkence t\u00fcrleri gibi ac\u0131 vericidir fakat insanlar kavramlara verdikleri anlamlar nedeniyle bunu oldu\u011fu gibi g\u00f6rmekte zorluk ya\u015farlar. Bu durum bana g\u00f6re \u00e7ok etkileyici ve kesinlikle tickle torture'u di\u011fer i\u015fkence t\u00fcrlerinden ay\u0131r\u0131yor. Bu neredeyse insan kodundaki bir hata gibidir. Programlamadaki bugd\u0131r ve bunu bu kadar ilgin\u00e7 yapan da budur. \n\n\n\nNOT: Tickle torture her ne kadar i\u015fkence tarz\u0131 olarak kullan\u0131lsa da bu olaya ayr\u0131yeten seks\u00fcel anlamlar verenler de vard\u0131r. E\u011fer youtube'da da tickle torture yazarsan\u0131z bu ki\u015filere hizmet olarak verilen bir\u00e7ok videonun oldu\u011funu g\u00f6recekseniz. Bu da ayn\u0131 \u015fekilde yine farkl\u0131 iki kavram\u0131 yan yana getirir. Bunlar haz ve i\u015fkencedir.\n\nNOT 2:  E\u011fer bu olay\u0131n beyninize olan s\u00fcrecini deneyimlemek istiyorsan\u0131z 'Tickled' adl\u0131 belgeseli izleyebilirsiniz. \u00c7ok farkl\u0131 twistleri olan bir belgesel ve eminim izlerken olaya verdi\u011finiz anlam\u0131n de\u011fi\u015fti\u011fini g\u00f6receksiniz. Belgesel, tickle torture'un nas\u0131l porn gibi bir markete d\u00f6n\u00fc\u015ft\u00fcr\u00fcld\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn\u00fc ve nas\u0131l bu olaydan tonlarca para kazand\u0131\u011f\u0131n\u0131 anlat\u0131yor. Kesinlikle tavsiye ederim."

                "body": "Somewhere amongst the mortal plain, a lone figure is hunched over an old laptop. With only the sounds of her laptop dying and a virtual character displayed across the screen keeping her company, the one known as Captain begins her nightly ritual.\n\n\u201cOh, my sweet Fuhua!\u201d Captain bemoans, hand gently caressing against the surface of the laptop screen.\n\n\u201cHow I wish for you to be alive, to hold me in your strong arms, to bathe me in your immortal love!\u201d\n\nCaptain wanted nothing more for her dear waifu to appear before her, wreathed in holy flame and garments of man. Only then will her pesky friends stop making fun of her eternal devotion. Only then will she truly be complete.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomething felt different when Captain opened her laptop tonight. It made the same wheezing noises, and her beloved was still displayed majestically on its screen. But the laptop was glowing with an almost ethereal light, casting long shadows behind her still form.\n\nCaptain blinks once, then twice when the Night Squire moves.\n\n\u201cWhaaaaaat?\u201d She yelps, rubbing her eyes multiple times to make sense of the sight in front of her. But what she witnessed was not a lie. Fuhua still stands there on the bridge, but the smile on her face was unmistakable.\n\n\u201cHello, my follower.\u201d\n\nFuhua speaks in a delicate tone, the shoddiness of the laptop speakers doing nothing to mask the voice of her dreams. Captain almost fainted in shock if not for sheer willpower.\n\n\u201cYou- You can speak to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. I have been watching you since you were just a mere cadet. Your devotion towards me is admirable, and as such I have decided to grant your wish.\u201d Her beloved flashes another smile at her.\n\n\u201cThen my love-\u201c\n\n\u201cShall be acknowledged by me if you complete my requests.\u201d Fuhua smoothly cuts her off, and Captain could do nothing but nod. She could never deny her waifu after all.\n\n\u201cHead south, to the lair of the dragon. Then head east towards the witch\u2019s alcove. Obtain me their souls, and I shall come to you.\u201d\n\nA sword appears in front of Captain, and she recognizes it as the same one Fuhua used in one of her Stigmatas. Knowing what she must do, Captain grabs it with determination and heads off into the night.\n\nIt was time to be Fuhua\u2019s knight. It was time for her wish to come true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe distance between her home and the dragon\u2019s lair was not far, Captain notices as she arrives at the entrance in mere minutes. The lair resembled a large hole, with a bottom that could not be seen in the black of night.\n\n*\u201cThe Axolotl is a dragon that loves its riches, and its lair is said to be full of crystals and gems. Unfortunately, it is impossible for anyone outside of the dragon\u2019s following to enter the lair. To obtain the soul of Greed, you must lure it outside its territory. The Axolotl is a dangerous fellow, but even it has a weakness. Words of pure affection cause it to become immobile. Do not hesitate or let down your guard. Take the blade of Shenzhou and strike swiftly.\u201d*\n\nFuhua\u2019s melodious voice whispers in Captain\u2019s ear. She clenches her sword tightly, and reaches inside her bag for her gold. Taking out a piece, Captain tosses it within the dark depths.\n\nWhen she couldn\u2019t see the coin anymore, almost immediately a large shadow flew out of the pit. It lands directly in front of Captain, claws inches away from her feet. Captain peers at the massive death traps, before looking up to meet the Axolotl\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cRookie, why are you here?\u201d It hisses angrily. Captain notices a familiar piece of coin wedged between the scales along its face.\n\n\u201cI was merely making an offering. Do you like it?\u201d She gestures to the gold.\n\n\u201cYou dare send me gold of all items? I only find worth in crystals and gems!\u201d The Axolotl, clearly angered, slams a claw besides Captain's small form. She does not flinch, for her clear fondness of a certain immortal will allow her to best the offending reptile. Fueled by a sudden bout of love, Captain belts out a ode dedicated towards Fuhua.\n\nShe describes her gentle nature, the humble curves of her body, the warmth that her clothes provide, and everything else Captain loves. At first the Axolotl does not react, but as she starts a tirade about the shampoo Fuhua likely was using, it reels backwards with a face of pure disgust.\n\n\u201cNo! After two thousand years of existence, how can a simple human be the one to say such words of cringe towards me?\u201d The Axolotl groans and covers its ears with claws. Eyes shut tight, the dragon clearly wanted nothing to do with her.\n\nSeizing the opportunity, Captain raises her sword and slits the Axolotl\u2019s throat. It collapses to the ground with a heavy thud. As the old dragon\u2019s life bleeds away from its eyes, a glowing purple light presents itself in Captain\u2019s hands.\n\n*\u201cExcellent, you have obtained the soul of Greed. It\u2019s time to head east and finish this quest.\u201d*\n\nCaptain turns around to leave, but not before giving one last glance towards the fallen dragon.\n\n\u201cI had no grudge against you, but I must obey my beloved\u2019s orders. It was nice knowing you, Ax.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe journey to the Witch\u2019s den was far more treacherous than that of the dragon\u2019s lair. There were lengthy rivers to cross and a forest filled with monsters in her way. But her devotion pulled her through it all, and eventually Captain arrived at her destination. The home of the Witch was not grandiose, but had an eerie feeling Captain couldn\u2019t quite place.\n\n*\u201cThe Witch of Six-Fingers is known to capture popular individuals who wander near her home within her paintings. It is fortunate that you are not popular, so you are able to easily enter without fear of her sorcery. As an artist, she detests images that are deemed too pure, so use that knowledge to your advantage. While she will not trap you due to your plainess, she still has an infinite wealth of magic underneath her fingertips. Tread lightly, and obtain the Soul of Lust.\u201d*\n\nFuhua once again bestowed Captain her words of wisdom. Filled with confidence, she marches into the house. Inside, Captain could see rows upon rows of paintings, all filled with subjects she vaguely recognized. As she reaches the end of the long hallway, it suddenly opens up to a large room. It\u2019s decorated to the brim with paintings, and in the middle of it sits the Witch of Six-Fingers.\n\n\u201cYou, why are you here? Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m doing an assignment right now?\u201d The Witch growls at her, not looking up from the device she was fiddling on. Undeterred, Captain walks right up to her, a piece of paper in her hand.\n\n\u201cI want you to take a look at this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat-\u201d The Witch finally looks up, eyes widening as she lays them upon the art. Freezing in place, her eyes start to bleed heavily.\n\n\u201cI- I don\u2019t even want to describe what you are showing me. It\u2019s drawn by someone so sappy I can\u2019t even-\u201d The words die in her throat. The blood is now pooling at the bottom of their feet. With the Witch of Six-Fingers distracted, Captain takes her holy sword and ends another life.\n\n\u201cHmf. My painting is the best one you\u2019ll ever see. Only I can capture the beauty that is my goddess.\u201d Captain takes the time to lovingly kiss the painting, now stained with blood, and places it back in her bag. She then reaches out to grab the blue light expelled from the Witch\u2019s body.\n\n*\u201cWell done, my simp. You have gathered the soul of Lust and completed the quest. Now, return immediately and present them to me.\u201d*\n\n\u201cYes, my love.\u201d Captain replies. She is filled with anticipation that her dream will finally come true. As she exits the abode of the Witch, Captain spies a name that is written upon one of the finished paintings.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s her real name huh\u2026\u201d Not wanting to leave Fuhua waiting any longer, Captain ignores the thought forming in her mind and makes haste back to the holy land.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe laptop is still open when Captain finally arrives, her perfect deity standing in the same position as before. Captain ignores the gale the laptop is producing and focuses solely on Fuhua, who looks just as ethereal as when Captain first set off.\n\n\u201cThe souls?\u201d Fuhua prompts, and Captain quickly offers them to the laptop. They spin around for a few seconds before absorbing themselves into the laptop. Her beloved lets out a content sigh, before smiling once again.\n\n\u201cAre you coming to me now?\u201d Captain whispers, longing and excitement lacing her voice. It was finally time. Fuhua will come to life and she can be embraced by her waifu for the first time. They can hold hands and smile at each other across the dining table. Fuhua will tell Captain stories about long gone days, and Captain will lap up every word from her mouth.\n\nFinally, her two friends will acknowledge her love towards the fictional character. Fuhua smiles at her, and then speaks.\n\n\u201cTell me, oh follower of mine. What will you give me once I leave the virtual plane?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will give you my love, my devotion, and my very being.\u201d Captain replies earnestly. Her friends always scoffed when she said that, but that will soon end.\n\n\u201cI see. Then I shall ask you again. Do you think a god like me will need your gifts?\u201d Fuhua was still smiling, but her tone was now dark. Captain could do nothing but gape at the screen.\n\n\u201cAn immortal has no use for promises of love and devotion. There are plenty who love me, and I do not require any more.\u201d The Night Squire holds out the two souls, and Captain watches as they disappear into her hands.\n\n\u201cInstead I would rather have what my followers do not give me, being riches and fame. The two souls from a chronic gacha hoarder and a social media artist shall grant me that power. Millions of simps want my love. And you, the simplest of them all, have given me what I desire. I used your delusions, and now I have no more need of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut- But the wish!\u201d Captain splutters. Fuhua only smirks, and turns her back towards Captain.\n\n\u201cYou want me to come, correct? But I\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I? I think I have graced you with my presence long enough.\u201d Without waiting for a reply, Fuhua walks off to the distance.\n\n\u201cNow if you excuse me, I have a wedding outfit to buy for ninety six hundred crystals. And no, it\u2019s not for you.\u201d The epitome of perfection flashes one last grin at her before disappearing off screen.\n\nAs a clap of thunder lights up the dark room, the laptop finally succumbs to its fate and dies. The sounds of rain slowly engulfs the quietness.\n\nAnd Captain could do nothing but wallow in sorrow as flashing lights of red and blue surround her crumpled body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Somewhere, buried deep within the folds of time, a trio of teenagers are crammed in a small room. They were all usually busy, but on that day they found time to hang out together.*\n\n*\u201cYou know I don\u2019t play games right?\u201d One says, drawing a popular anime character on their IPad Pro.*\n\n*\u201cBut it\u2019ll be fun to coop together! We need three people for a team.\u201d Another begs, but the first just rolls their eyes and continues to mess with their device.*\n\n*\u201cI heard Genshin was nice this time of year.\u201d The last one speaks up, and waves off the indigent look the other gives them.*\n\n*\u201cAfter two years of playing I\u2019m getting sick of it. Veteran or not I want something fresh. And the gacha rate here is making me sad.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cBut I can\u2019t leave Fuhua alone! My waifu needs me.\u201d The two share a look at their friend\u2019s sudden simping and sigh.*\n\n*\u201cDon\u2019t you have other things to do then play games? Like assignments?\u201d The artist comments flatly. The veteran nods in agreement, turning off their own game.*\n\n*\u201cBesides, all this drooling over Fuhua will be your downfall one day.\u201d*\n\n*The simp doesn\u2019t reply to their words, and only continues to look at the wondrous image of her beloved goddess.*"

The inner circle was the first to know: the Monopoly got only a week to live. And now, a week later, here we are.\"\n\n A few workers pushed a body bag into the river. The Commander sprayed a can of deodorant through a lighter and set the black thrash bag aflame. Some cried, some saluted as the late dictator's body found it's way down the Lazy River.\n\n\"Now, for the future!\" continued the Administrator. \"We shall introduce a new, democratic an-\" He couldn't finish his thoughts. One of the workers screamed. Around 50 Tiki Tribesmen ran towards them down the corridor, throwing chairlegs and lightbulbs at the grieving company. They fled. Some jumped into the river. Others ran away as fast as they could. The Monopoly's private army and the inner circle took shelter behind some tables and the bar.\n\n\"I did NOT like your 'democratic' hokus-pokus.\" said the Commander to the Administrator while reloading his carabine. \"Too much power to the people. I will be the successor of the Monopoly.\" The Administrator went pale. \"I mean you can't do this! These folks were oppressed by the Monopoly. We have to free them! Commander, you can't do this!\" The Commander signaled his men. \"Oh, I absolutely can.\" At once, the battalion jumped out of the cover and rushed the Tikis. Then silence. \n\nThe Administrator peeked out. He saw around 15 bodies. Slain workers, Tikis frozen in blood and soldiers lying face down. He got out of the makeshift barricade. \"Now, attention please!\" the survivors gathered around him. \"From now on, the Monopoly shall be known as Republic of the Lazy River! Of the people, by the people, for the people!\" His voice echoed down the dead-silent halls. The workers looked at each other. One of them started screaming. Two joined him, then everyone.

This is my first time doing anything like this, and I am overwhelmed and in desperate need of advice. Lol\n\nMy partner and I are trying to buy a used Class B conversion van from a private seller. The whole thing costs $67k, and we have $30k to put down. \n\nAfter looking though our options, it looks like a personal unsecured loan would be the easiest option, so we could buy quickly.  \n(I already went to my Credit Union and applied for an auto/RV loan last week, and they only approved me up to $20k due to the fact that it\u2019s a conversion van, and they\u2019re only able to finance for the van itself.)\n\nSo that leads me to my next question(s):\n\n- Would I even be able to get a $37k personal loan? I make 80k a year, my credit score is 780 (probably closer to 765 after a hard credit pull) and my DTI is fairly low. I pay $762 in rent and $289 on my car. (Which I\u2019m selling very soon)\n\n- My partner and I want to co-borrow this loan together. However, he makes waaayyy less money on paper and has a 740 credit score. Am I better off just applying alone?\n\n- Would I be more likely to get a smaller personal loan (17k) and then conjoining that with my 20k offer from my bank? Or is that an all-around bad idea?\n\n- LightStream looks like one of our best options. But I hear a lot of mixed reviews and that it\u2019s really hard to get approved. Does anyone else have a good recommendations for a personal lender?\n\n\nThanks for reading this far, and I appreciate any advice."

I do have an active subscription, and I have the GPX files, but I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t be able to get my computer to read the device.  \n(My device is a new InReach Explorer +, if that\u2019s relevant)\n\n2) it is my current understanding that I cannot load the entire PCT into my Garmin all at once, or is that false?  \nMy main concern would be loading the rest of the files into the device as I go. I\u2019m obviously not going to have a computer, so how does one go about that? Do you go use a Trail Angels computer? A public computer? \n\nApologies if these are dumb questions, I kinda put off buying a good 2-way communication/gps  device until the last minute, for a multitude of reasons.

                "body": "So, awhile back I made a post talking about the questions I had as a vgc player (id appericate if you could go check it out and give some answers!). After looking at a few of the tips, I can definitely say I've improved. Hell, I even tried to make my first team, and it's pretty unorthodox (at leasti think it is). Regardless here's my \"Sun Room\" team. Please rate it if you could (im sensitive tho plz dont be harsh). Surprisingly enough though this team has actually gotten me an around 70-80% win rate on showdown it really works well imo (then again im new and it could definitely use improvements so here we go).\n\nLeafeon @ Power Herb  \nAbility: Chlorophyll  \nLevel: 50  \nEVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD  \nBrave Nature  \nIVs: 0 Spe  \n- Detect  \n- Solar Blade  \n- Iron Tail  \n- Dig  \n\nSo Leafeon is a bit of a weird choice, but it is REALLY strong. I know all of these might seem weird at first, why is there no speed investment? Why not use venusaur? But aside from it being cool and one of my favorite eeveelutions, this mon has a legitimate niche over venusaur. For one, its a physical attacker, which is key in taking care of threats like Fini, plus a lot of my team is special based anyways. Two, it gets both ground and steel coverage for bulk when dynamaxed. Three and four, it doesn't need to rely on dynamax or LO as much as Venusaur seems to, but it still can dynamax and deal huge damage. The second big reason I chose this mon in the first place is the speed. Ive found that with min speed, im able to go first in trick room as well as when chlorophyll boosted by sun almost always. Sure, sometimes it won't, but the fact that its so flexible makes its such a big threat. I played around with different speeds but just went with none in the end as it seemed to work best, plus the hp is nice. As for item, I didn't really know what to give this thing, so I gave it the herb just in case I need to pull out a dig or solar blade and sun isn't up. That scenario hasn't come up yet tho, so there may be a better ability for it.\n\nCharizard-Gmax @ Life Orb  \nAbility: Solar Power  \nLevel: 50  \nGigantamax: Yes  \nEVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  \nTimid Nature  \nIVs: 0 Atk  \n- Scorching Sands  \n- Heat Wave  \n- Air Slash  \n- Protect  \n\nAs yes, the Zard, king of sun teams. Seriously tho this thing is a beast. I gave it max special and spatk, I know I may have to change it later for calcs but it works for now and besides im a newbie lol. Speed is the most important thing on this mon, as it is the one mon that will never be used in trick room, its pretty much sun only. Not much else to say, big damage, LO for even more, wildfire is a pain etc etc.\n\nTorkoal @ Charcoal  \nAbility: Drought  \nLevel: 50  \nEVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD  \nQuiet Nature  \nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe  \n- Heat Wave  \n- Earth Power  \n- Eruption  \n- Protect  \n\nThis is actually the mon that brought about the idea of a Sun Room, being extremely slow, a drought user, and very powerful. I pretty much bring torkoal every game, whether it be to fill a support role with drought or be a massive TR dmg dealer. Again, evs are simple, max spatk max hp as always, for good bulk and attack when I need it. Its proved to be quite reliable when TR is up I can pretty much spam Eruption then Heat Wave and something will 100% go down. \n\nGastrodon @ Sitrus Berry  \nAbility: Storm Drain  \nLevel: 50  \nEVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD  \nQuiet Nature  \nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe  \n- Earth Power  \n- Weather Ball  \n- Recover  \n- Scald  \n\nStorm Drain is KEY in order to stop those pesky water types. This mon, like most others, is very flexible. I can put it on sun teams for a boosted weather ball as well as storm drain support or on TR to deal major dmg. This is probably the most important mon of my team because it single handedly stops my water type problem as well as rock and ground. I love you Gastro. (Evs are obvious, I assume. If there are better ones plz lmk)\n\nDusclops @ Eviolite  \nAbility: Frisk  \nLevel: 50  \nEVs: 252 HP / 92 Def / 164 SpD  \nRelaxed Nature  \nIVs: 0 Spe  \n- Trick Room  \n- Brick Break  \n- Night Shade  \n- Pain Split  \n\nOf course, the premier TR setter himself, Dusclops. I used a mixed ev spread so that this thing didn't take much dmg from either side. Brick Break is to activate policy on Staka, TR is obvious, PS for healing, and NS for dmg. I really wanted WoW on this thing but it just doesn't seem possible each move here is hella important. Not much else to say, incredible in TR, and is also good as an Anti TR lead. I usually have it in the back of sun teams too just in case things go south and I need to use Torkoal/Gastro/Leafy.\n\n\nStakataka @ Weakness Policy  \nAbility: Beast Boost  \nLevel: 50  \nEVs: 252 HP / 244 Atk / 12 SpD  \nBrave Nature  \nIVs: 0 Spe  \n- Trick Room  \n- Gyro Ball  \n- Rock Slide  \n- Body Press  \n\nPretty obvious one here. Stakataka puts in so much work there are lots of games where I can just dynamax with policy and just win. It has TR as well for backup, along with standard stabs plus BP for defense dmg. Max HP, and this is gonna sound hella embarrassing, but the reason I chose 12 spD was just cause it was most used on pikalytics lol (im sorry again this is my first team I know there's probably tons wrong). \n\n\nAnyways yeah, thats the team. Please feel free to ask questions i know i didn't describe everything that well here and critique as much as you want i like this team a lot but I want it to be as good as possible before I go hunting in my shield game. Sorry for any grammar errors, im writing this literally at midnight lol. Again, ask any questions needed, sorry if it sucks, and uh if you haven't and you could maybe check out my last post? I would love any help. Regardless, hope you like this team!"

                "body": "Hello everyone! I'm a complete newbie at vgc, only just getting into it now during series 7. I was able to climb myself to master ball tier with ease, but actually battling in master ball their has proven to be very unsuccessful for me. I've lost almost all of my games, and now my lose ratio is even greater then my win(embarrassing I know). I'd obviously love to just ask something like \"how do I gitgud\" but I know thats an extremely broad question. So I've decided to just ask a few questions here. I'd appreciate it if you could answer any of them or just help me improve in some other way. I'd really love to get into this format, but right now I just can't win. I've tried a variety of teams, right now im mainly using this one https://pokepast.es/9ed84853b89f322d. If this team is bad in any way or you have other recs for beginner series 7 teams PLEASE let me know. But as much as I'd like to blame it on team its probably just that I suck. Nonetheless here are some problems I've been running into. \n\n- How do I deal with Dragapult?\n\nWeird question maybe, but seriously this thing sucks. The team im using is very tailwind reliant, but this thing is able to outspeed and ohko almost every mon I have. When given LO or WP or just paired with clefairy I just can't win. \n\n- How to I deal with Zard?\n\nHoly shit fuck this thing. Wildfire wipes my team and in sun regardless of dynamax I just deadass can't live anything. If I do wildfire is hell and I keep taking extra damage. I can't even kill this thing without wasting my dynamax and even then it usually gets a wildfire which cripples me and then something else will come out to kill my now weakened dynamax. If yall have good zard teams btw plz lmk this thing is insane.\n\n- How do I deal with WP?\n\nAside from just not using a super effective move, ive pretty much learned to do that by now. But self procs are annoying af and once they activate pretty much nothing can tank a hit at all. \n\n- How do I stop being so implusive? And how can I become more knowledgeable?\n\nThis is the most important one, I know the answer is probably gonna be something like \"practice\" but nonetheless I think this is the main reason I lose. Both in team prep and just in turns I usually don't think and act impulsively somewhat, ill just use a super effective move or do a very simple mind game that is very easy to see through. This kind of goes hand in hand with my next question as I think if im able to know what items abilities and moves mons run and if I can survive those will allow me to stop being so rash and actually figure out what they're going to do and how to prevent it. \"Practice\" seems obvious but that would just suck. Do I have to practice until I just remember what everything runs and has? Most top players i watch are able to know what something has or does so easily, even if the mon is unorthodox. \n\n- How do I deal with Speed Control?\n\nThis is also a big cause of problems for me. Im unable to go first. I don't really have much to say here, but yeah how am I supposed to stop tailwind? Trick room? Max Airstream? Hell I know the answer might just be taunt but I've seen teams without taunt succeed so there has to be another answer right? \n\n- Rental vs Firsthand Teams?\n\nShould I use rentals or make a team myself? And how do I know if said rental is good or not? Are there any good rentals available? This is a smaller one though cause I've tried so many and still failed so I dont think its the teams fault, its probably just mine. \n\n- How do I teambuild? \n\nObviously you don't have to answer all of these, but this one in particular you really don't need to answer. This is such a broad topic that I think won't be able to be covered, plus I think rentals are good enough for me right now (if they aren't lmk). \n\n- How can I use team preview as best as possible?\n\nAs of right now, my strategy usually consists of either bringing the mons that will work most consistently against their whole team, or if my team has some sort of standard lead(like WP teams) just go with that. This got me through most tiers but now in MB tier they usually always bring something that counters me. \n\n- When should I dynamax? How do I know what to dynamax?\n\nAs of now I usually just dynamax first turn as its the only way I ever stand i chance at winning. I dont know how people are able to dynamax late game, as if the opponent maxes first I they just kill everything I have. Another side question would be how do I live max moves? To me rn I just have to max asap or they'll kill me with their max. I have to ko as many as possible before I go down, only then do I stand a chance. \n\n- What are some common rain/sun/trickroom/tailwind/wp etc mons? How are some basic ways to deal with these?\n\nThis goes hand in hand with the knowledge question. May as well get to learning now? Anyways what are some common mons that run any of these so I can recognize them and then counter them? Sometimes I see dusclops and think ok this is trick room but then won't even know how to counter it. I kind of just go with how can I not let it set up whatever it needs and usually just try to kill it asap which barely works. Other times it won't even be a tr team, they'll send out something else entirely and ill just lose. Other other times they'll just have a drought or drizzle user and I can't even stop them then. OTHER other other times I won't know what mon runs what and hit something super effectively and then surprise WP and I lose. \n\n- What are basic leads? How do I know what my opponent is leading with?\n\nLeads are the most important part of pokemon imo. If you fail ur lead you pretty much lose. This is how I lose a lot, I pick a wrong lead, the first turn goes horribly, and then they sweep me. \n\n- For both rentals and when I decide to teambuild, how do I know what the calcs for evs are?\n\nThis goes again with the knowledge question. Please don't tell me I just have to go to the showdown calculator and keep putting in numbers to figure it out. If so I will, but that'll be hella annoying. Anyways rn for rentals I usually see mons with random ass ev spreads. Ik these aren't actually random and they must serve some purpose, but how do I figure out what? It would probably be useful to know what this mon can live and kill in certain situations. And in the future when im building a team, how should I know what evs to give it?\n\nThis is all for now. I may post another one later because I probably will have more questions. Please don't feel the need to answer all of these I know its a lot but any help would be greatly appreciated. If you've gotten this far, thank you so much for deciding to help me. I'd really love to improve so any tips in general would help. If you all have any teams as well I'd also love to see and maybe use them. Thanks!"

My mother contacted him asking about it the day of, no response.\n\n\nTwo weeks later he finally responds. \n\n\nHe refuses to help pay for \"*a surgery she doesnt need*\", misgendering me almost instantly.\n\n\nHe then proceeded to call me a manipulator for even insinuating that he'd *DARE* support his only son.\n\n\nI'm completely lost.

When I said we just wanted water the waiter looked surprised!!\n\nThe next day we went to a diner together and the man at the counter (who we later found out was VERY conservative but was still rather friendly towards us) thought I was not only a cis man, but he thought I was from the local art college here while I'm still only in high school! He was surprised to find that out as well!\n\nHonestly? I think this is really neat, since my voice is constantly saving my ass from getting misgendered as well."

It's not really an issue for me.\n\n\nI started testosterone the beginning of this year, and well... Y'know, bottom growth! It happened, so I can now be \"included in the penis jokes\" and my friends in choir lightheartedly make fun of the fact that I essentially have a micropenis \ud83d\ude05\n\n\nThis past week in my barbershop ensemble meet after school(composed of really close pals of mine), we were jokingly suggesting a song that essentially was talking about a man having a bad day, and his solution was to \"take a look at my enormous penis\", and all his problems would melt away.\n\n\nOne of the baritones quickly suggested that \"whoever has the smallest penis needs to sing that solo\" and immediately we pondered in silence.\n\n...\n\nThen I remembered\n\n...\n\n\n*I had the perfect opportunity to make a trans joke.*\n\n\nBarely missing a beat, I yelled out, \"hEY GUYS\u2014 WAIT\u2014 *I* HAVE THE SMALLEST PENIS!!!\"\n\nAnd almost IMMEDIATELY the lil octet broke into wheezing laughter, and the aforementioned baritone, who've I know since I was 11, replied, \"It makes it even funnier because anyone who knew you before highschool is IMMEDIATELY just gonna go *'waiiiiit a minute, somethin' ain't right here!'*\" and this is by far one of the funniest stories I've gotten as a trans man.\n\nTo be clear for anyone concerned, we were all messing around, and they all still see me just as manly as the rest of them.

I really want him to have fun, but I'm afraid of allowing dismemberments and instakills on crits and destroying combat balance. How can I make combat more immersive and real ?

The shop was affiliated to our school and the shopkeeper asked me what book the school recommended for chemistry practicals. I replied with the publisher's name and it all hit me when i came home.\n\nWhat if i said the wrong publisher's name? What if another teacher recommends another publisher's book? What if the shop orders tons of books from the publisher i talked about and later the school decides they want to follow another book? Will they charge me money? Will i be expelled? Will my parents get in trouble? It was a surprise i didn't get an ounce of sleep that day and from then onwards it only got worse.\n\nWhy is mom behaving like that? Is she angry with me? But i don't remember doing anything to annoy her? Did she fight with dad? Has he decided to leave her? Did she fight with my grandparents or her sister? \n\nMy friend has been busy. But I think they hate me. For that one time i didn't believe them. Maybe she has finally realised what a pos i am and decided to stop talking to me. Maybe she thinks i only hurt other people. Maybe i am too judgmental. I knew i shouldn't have been frank with her! Maybe she is suffering from something? Something she cannot talk about? Maybe- Oh she texted me.\n\nI was supposed to do class yesterday but i didn't feel like it and one of my friends said that there were two people so i should probably go and do the class. The two people, A and B seem to be in a relationship at least by the way they act. I said they do too much pda and I'd rather stay here than do class. For some reason i think they heard about it. \n\nA's texts have been weird. Or so i think.\n\nI was so anxious about this, i went to sleep at 3 yesterday. In the morning after breakfast i went to sleep again only to constantly wake up with different outcomes of what might happen. After one such dream i felt restlessness in my whole body. I was shivering and i could feel my heartbeat in every part of my body.\n\nI just want a normal life."

It's one step away from \"femoids\" really lol\n\nFemale is just an adjective, I'm a female human which is called a woman.

It looks like the gem is way too small (slightly larger than the hook thingy) so it doesnt have any support to stay outside. \n\nI called my piercer and she told me to come back tomorrow to see what she can do. She said I should try to take it out but I'm too scared to do it on my own so I'd rather wait, but i'm worried the skin will close completely on top of the piercing overnight. \n\nAlso yesterday in my sleep, i accidentally hit my nose with my arm.

I'm not really a morning person and I'm homeschooled so i will usually wake up around 9 am, sometimes 11 during weekends, because I have really bad insomnia and waking up earlier than that drains me. \nDuring weekdays I usually do my chores as I wake up before starting to study, but when it comes to the weekend, I like to take my time in the morning and have a nice breakfast and rest a little before starting my house chores, to take a break from all the overstimulation during the week.\n\nMy mom isn't really happy about it tho, every weekend she lectures me about how disrespectful it is from me to let my own mother wake up at 6 and tire herself out on house chores and I should be the one doing it. This really confuses me because I try to help out as much as I can around the house, and the way she asks for it is a bit,,,undirect? She makes weird passive agressive comments, and when I actually ask her if she wants me to do something she gets angry.\n\nFor example, today my mom was complaining about having to wake up at 6 to clean the toilet, and to paraphrase her, she said something along the lines of having a daughter but feeling like she has a son because I don't care anough about house chores. \nI told her I would gladly help with anything she wants me to, but I can't know what she wants me to do if she doesn't tell me. She said that she shouldn't have to tell me this and I told her waking up at 6 on a weekend to clean the toilet is not exactly something that feels \"obvious\" to me and she got angry and said it should be and I have no empathy towards my own mother. \n\nThe problem isn't the chores themselves, I will do them after I'm done waking up lol, but she wakes up early, cleans everything and then gets angry at me for not doing it. This is confusing me, I don't understand why she doesn't just ask me directly if she wants me to do it so badly, and why does she get angry at me when I ask if she wants help? She said if I was a good daughter I would be begging her to do chores instead of her and that I should be ashamed for enjoying my breakfast while my mom is doing so much work, is this true? Do I lack empathy? This makes me feel really bad.\n\n(english isn't my first language sorry for any weird phrasing)"

I read a lot and I learned a lot about sexuality and most people figure out their sexuality when adults, so I was wondering if you could give me a hand. Am I really too young to think about this? I'm really confused and scared, I don't talk about this to anyone except my best friend and I could use some support. \n\nThank you and sorry if I made mistakes, English is not my first language :)"

From a logical standpoint, it makes sense. From an emotional one, not as much. The best results come from trying to understand one another's way of thinking.",

To help you learn more about the industry that gives us fresh drinking water every day!

I was one of the founders of the USGBC chapter at Rowan so I can help guide you as well as the club advisor in how to start a professional/education chapter at school."

It's not like your always asking her exact location all the time, esp when you mentioned that you trust her to be safe, which I assume that you don't always ask her where she goes. Like it's not even controlling it's perfectly reasonable.\n\nIf the gender was flipped you'd definitely be voted NTA. I literally don't care if people downvote me because like ??? why are people saying YTA?? She's literally asking YOU to fetch her everytime lowkey EXPECTING you to know where tf she is without telling you where she is?? Like bro if she's not telling you where she would be going, then she shouldn't expect you to fetch her and you should be waiting for her at home or smth. That's common sense.\n\nThose voting YTA are lowkey also contradicting themselves. Ok, so you just leave her to her devices like completely. Okay, she's TOO DRUNK to get home and want you to get her, but obviously because you don't know where she is, you leave her alone. She gets into some sort of trouble or something, and then you're still gonna be an AH, because these people would say \"it's you're responsibilty to care for her!\" blah blah blah. It literally makes zero sense that YTA in this situation.\n\nI'm not saying your wife is the AH, but I definitely think there's a major communication problem between the both of u in this situation, and personally I think \"well you didn't ask\" as a common reply gets on someone's nerves quite easily, especially when it concerns the other's safety and wellbeing.\n\nI do think that saying it's a character flaw wasn't right tho. But still, I understand that you'd be exasperated at this.\n\nEdit: I'm a woman, and I find this perfectly reasonable. There are times where she doesn't need to tell you where she is, but this isn't one of the times. Especially when you're concerned about her safety.",

I self-isolate sometimes due to depression, overstimulation, and fear that no one really likes me anyway, so the genuine friendships I do develop often die out because of my own faults. But I'm really lonely. I feel like I have so much love to give and it's only a matter of time before I'm so closed off I'll never find anyone to love again. I know I can be weird/unnaproachable at surface level, and I know I'm not the best at letting my guard down but surely there is someone out there that is persistent enough to try and get to know me. I really just need a person to initiate things with me and be empathetic enough to realise how much I need someone that actually cares. The problem is, I'm so scared I'm just impossible to love.\n\nSorry if this didn't make sense. I really hope people can relate, and any advice is really appreciated :)\n\nTl;dr - I have bad rsd from 16 years of undiagnosed adhd and am socially traumatised. My relationships and friendships are limited and I have an emotional hole in my life that I don't know how to resolve."

In an example from my own life, I actually went 5 months before realizing that two of my female coworkers were actually dating each other because the two of them constantly referred to each other and the members of their mutual friend group as their girlfriend, so I always just assumed those two were referring to each other as their friend. It just seems really confusing why some women refer to their friends with a term that can be used interchangeably for a romantic partner, especially in an age where its becoming increasingly acceptable to have same sex partners. I have absolutely no judgement on women who choose to date other women (hell, I'm recently out as a demisexual myself), but I honestly just don't really get why women in purely platonic relationships would refer to each other in that way. \n\n(And before anyone asks how I wasn't able to tell that my coworkers were dating, I don't really work with either of them very often, and when I do work with them it's usually just one or the other. Additionally, they're both pretty low-key about their relationship and not at all big on PDA, so they never publicly expressed any physical affection beyond what I would expect out of someone who was just a friend.)",

Some highlights from that episode include them both poking fun at one of the aunt's high school boyfriends who was living on welfare, the ex revealing secrets about one of my best friends that he had told her in confidence, the aunt enabling (and to an extent maybe even encouraging) my ex to use alcohol as a coping mechanism for her trauma and anxiety issues, and the ex getting mad at me when I needed to rest in bed when I had mild food poisoning because I \"wasted the entire day\" in the guest bedroom. The breakup of that relationship still messes with me a little to this day because of how viciously she tore me apart in her Dear John letter, particularly when she told me that I was only ever a good boyfriend on paper. \n\nHad I even half the backbone I do now, I would've told them off, packed my things, and flown back to Texas after the dinner incident. By no means was I saint in that relationship since I was fairly toxic myself with how clingy and dependent I was on her, but I detest my cowardice because I was more concerned with pleasing her than standing up for myself.",

It's not that they don't want to find purpose it's that they feel like they can't, and therefore there's no point trying. That \"I can't do it so why try\" mindset is very very common among people with depression and can be overpowering.\n\nI really hope someday mental health can be truly destigmatized.

However due to lack of eloquence  on my part, I may have failed to properly explain myself. Also, please take the time explain where I went wrong, and give advice on how I can improve. Please. \n\nI wasn't looking to discuss race in regards to a movie series that involves a big purple alien, a sentient tree, a talking racoon like species, a pantsless duck, a giant green rage monster, an android, and a sorcerer and his magic cape. I could go on and on, but I think I have made my point . \n\nBut since you want to  bring it up, I'm going to take the bait and put my foot in my mouth big time. \n\nLet's get a few things clear.  \n\nAs it stands right now, white people are the ones buying the most tickets, we're talking 70% or more. It seems the majority of people are avoiding the movie, regardless of the color of their skin.\n\nThis is notable because that the bulk of our attendance comes from the Hispanic and Native American population.  \n\nAlmost entirely absent from Black Panther showings is the sizeable and constantly growing black population. As a side note, they have displayed a clear preference for faith based movies, which is something that intrigues me. \n\nSo, you tell me pal, does this shadow conspiracy involve almost completely white audiences for the movie? Is that part of their racist agenda?\n\nAs I said, it's a non factor, and a non issue.  \n\nWhat's more, is that the first Black Panther did fantastic for us and was second only to Infinity War for the level of business that year.\n\nPersonally, the demo breakdowns fascinate me, and I like to make note of it so I can better assist guests in the future. \n\nAnd again, my apologies to anyone I have offended, I only ask that you correct me so I can do better in the future.",

We have lost thousands of jobs since the start of the year. \n\nOur local college football team got destroyed so badly they silenced a sold out arena. That really put a damper on a lot of locals spirits as well. 3 points against 43.

In high school, I was in the circle of both nerd people and popular ones. I didn't feel like myself in any of those friend groups-- I was also not very likable at that time and didn't have the self-awareness to realize it. I became insecure and possibly codependent. The idea of being without any friends terrified me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn college, I found myself in a circle of friends who kept their academics in check but also knew how to have fun and take it easy. I felt like I finally found my type of people. But at that time, the insecurity of having no friends latched onto me and I became dependent on one friend in my group. Needless to say, she didn't appreciate that at all, and she most probably had issues with me before we became friends. At one point, she broke her friendship with me, pointing out the flaws in my character that she absolutely hated. She was the center of our friend circle, but my other friends still hung out with me till the end of college. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, the pandemic started. I got enough time to self-reflect, almost healed from the trauma of abandonment by that one friend, and tried to become a more well-rounded person. I became a lot reclusive, spent less and less time online talking with my friends outside of class and a few from the class. I was once addicted to social media, but now I hate the idea of using it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few days ago I sat for my uni admission exam as the covid infection rate is comparatively lower right now in our country. I had never felt so happy and carefree in all of 6+ years of HS and college. I approached people, was very social, actually enjoyed my time being outside and around people. It felt like the baggage in my soul that I was carrying around with me was finally gone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, to the question finally, how do I get into the right type of friend group in uni? How did you make friends during the time of the beginning of your uni? Should I continue to try to make friends if I become friends with a circle of people I don't enjoy being in? I would just wing it and go with the flow had I not been insecure ab making friends in the past. But now, being out into the world again soon is making me nervous."

Have boundaries that you actually stick to; doing so will garner more respect, make you appear more confident, and in turn, more attractive. As many have already said here, humour also gives you a big leg up. The type of humour will vary depending on the woman, so just be yourself (sorry to be sounding Disney-like) when joking around; you\u2019ll be able to attract more compatible personalities! Lastly, just enjoy yourself. Don\u2019t go out with the mindset of being on the prowl, as that can translate to your overall demeanour and energy. However, if you\u2019re just genuinely enjoying your own company (or friends), you\u2019ll come off as secure and independent, which are both very attractive qualities. It\u2019s usually when you\u2019re not actively looking that people begin to show up.",

I want them to want to be open-minded before starting such talks, but I fear I'm unable to communicate that without everything devolving into confrontation once more, instead of us working together. I fear I'm going to end up feeling hurt and misunderstood yet again. \n\nSo I started looking for other videos that might address this particular topic but found nothing aside from the \"Helping a Father and Son Reconnect\" from about a year ago. The video is great, but I felt the issue was more focused on the brothers and dad, than on interests vs parents as a topic. \n\nPerhaps at HealthyGamer you already have such an idea planned for the future, but in case it isn't it would be very useful for it to be featured at some point in time.

I feel like a bad sub for that.

We have discord, sometimes spend a lot of time talking post games and analysing them, so we are looking for friendly company :D We do wish to improve.\n5.

Because you cannot convince me that watching your friend die for 12 years and then her disappearing and being the only one person to remember her wouldnt make Homura twisted. \n\nPlus at the end of the Rebellion Homura is in state of despair as her Soul Gem is about to hatch a new witch right after Kyuubey almost got his hands on Law of Cycle, thus Madoka. Homura seeing that, seeing that even after Madoka disappeared from \"normal\" world, she can be still hunted, of course that would hit her soft spot even more. \n\nAnother point - the flower scene from Rebellion. Homura learns about true feelings of Madoka, of course she would want to free her and give her normal, happy life, no matter what sins she bore or what she would become, she wanted to see Madoka and protect her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy opinions are pretty biased probably, but I dont think Rebellion doesnt deserve such hate and doesnt assassinate Homura's character."

She wasn't born with them, she didn't gain them from anything Demeter did, they appeared after the 10 year exile. They were meant to tell the reader that Persephone had actually done work during this time (instead of showing us the work she's been doing, but I digress) and signify character growth.\n\nSo what does this mean? Persephone losing her green hands means we lose the one part of her character that told us that she changed for the better. We lose all of the proof that she's done hard work. Because even though Rachel WANTS us to think Persephone went through character development, outside of her green hands, nothing about her has changed.\n\nNow that her hands are pink again, what this is saying is that Persephone does not have to work for anything anymore. She is Queen of the Underworld. No longer will she struggle over anything worse than a chipped nail. She can do whatever she wants and have everything, including the narrative, be completely on her side.\n\nHer trauma is unrealistic, coming and going whenever the story sees fit. Apollo has no control over her fertility goddess powers. Leto can't convince her of anything. Demeter cannot get through to her. Zeus can't touch her now. She's been let off from TGOEM peacefully. Her friends are all yes-men. She has all the money she could ask for.\n\nThere are no stakes that aren't fixed with a flick of the wrist. There are no conflicts solved with a simple fix. All that is important to Rachel is that everything ends perfectly for her two main characters and everything else is left in the trash to rot.\n\nLore Olympus is not a story of change. It is not a story of love. It is a story about a spoiled brat becoming a sugar baby and getting everything she wants. I am appalled."

But I'm 40 pages in and this might be just about the most obnoxious thing I've ever read after 50 shades of gray. \n\n*Why* for crying out loud does the protagonist only care about how she looks? She's supposed to be the best assassin yadayada and she just focuses on how pretty she is. Besides, she might just be the most impulsive assassin I've ever read about in a book. Like 0 assessing of a situation before saying anything. If that's the *best* they've got, the bar for it must be rather low. But I digress. \n\n*Why* does every character description have to be focused on how hot they are?! Especially when they're not supposed to like each other?! The protagonist was put in the gallows by the king and when his son and his captain go get her out she basically starts a hotness ranking. I mean what the fuck. \n\n*Also why do they talk to each other as if they were friends?!* Or as if they knew each other?! They're supposed to hate her, and she's supposed to hate them, and lo and behold the captain melts in just about 50 pages and tells her she's pretty as soon as she puts on a dress??\n\nI'm sorry, but what in the heck is this lmao this is so unrealistic and superficial! \n\nIs the whole series like this? Or does it get any better? Is there anything else to these characters than how hot they are? You can't go ten pages without the words pretty or beautiful popping up. \n\nAm I the only one, or does anyone else see it too?\n\nQuick edit because I can't keep up with the comments right now:\n\nWhy is it that everytime I post here I step on a hornet nest lol \n\nI'll add an apparently much needed disclaimer: dear folks, yes this was a rant, but it's my opinion - I never wanted to imply you can't enjoy these books! So please don't take it that way, I thought it was kind of obvious I was only speaking for myself because...for whom else otherwise?? \n\nAlso I'm glad to hear the series gets better, I'll probably keep at it while skipping the cringy descriptions just to see where it goes :D"

Of course I don't work in heavily mechanical jobs or with potentially damaging tools, which of course makes a world of difference, but do stones really crack that easily? Or is it more that people plan to wear these *literally* all the time, so also in the shower, when baking, washing dishes, etc.? I've even slammed my opal ring into doors and tables couple of times and my heart quivered more than the stone itself. \n\nThis really doesn't want to be an attack on anyone's preferences!

I'm on the latest Linux version on EndeavourOS. Windows is on dev/sda2. Windows system files are on dev sda1. This install is very old like 2014 old. It was Windows 8 once. There is a weird ntfs partition on dev/sda3/ and idk what it is.

When he flipped through Morgenstern's book, he realized that the book is a verbose, at times tediously dull satire of Florinese history, save the action parts that his father plucked out to read. He calls his editor, puts all his current projects on hold, and works on a publishable abridgment of the original S. Morgenstern text, which he then presents to us.\n\nThis is the introduction of the book that William Goldman has given us on his inspirations for writing this book. But the truth is there is no S. Morgenstern or his book.\n\nMany fans, over the years, have been fooled by Goldman's introduction of The Princess Bride and have gone to bookstores, asking for the original copy of S. Morgenstern's Princess Bride, only to find out it was all a hoax!\n\nThis is one of the greatest trolling done by an author, in my opinion, and it's still fooling people today!",

                "body": "**Availability:** My time zone is PST. I'm available at 5 PM PST from Monday to Wednesday, and Friday. I'm free all day on Sunday. I have other groups on Thursday and Saturday, so I'm not available on those days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Looking for:** Online Pathfinder 1e group that is 18+.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Equipment:** Have a mic and a camera (though I prefer camera off, lol, but I can have it on if you require it). Have experience using Roll20, DnDBeyond, and Forge-VTT. Can learn other VTTs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Experience:** I'm actually a noob to Pathfinder 1e, but I do have a group that's learning 2e. Other campaigns that I have played are D&D 3.5e and 5e, so I have things to go off of to learn to play Pathfinder 1e. I have played Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, so I may have an idea of how 1e works, but I'm sure there's things in that game that don't apply to the tabletop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**About Me:** I'm a 32-year old, married woman. I'm a person that enjoys heavy roleplay, but I do work on optimizing my characters to be of use to the group.\n\nI don't pick bad feats or spells unless they wouldn't badly affect the build and would add flavor to my character's backstory. In these cases, I would only pick one (which is usually just a spell), so I can focus on optimizing the rest of the build. However, I can focus solely on optimization or even go completely the other way and build a character off of flavor for story purposes.\n\nI can play in groups that are more 50/50 on combat (which is actually what my other groups are), but I know that I enjoy roleplay and fully fleshing out the characters. I enjoy combat but it needs to have a purpose (roleplay leading up to a fight, I'll ofc expect enemies in a dungeon, etc).\n\nI enjoy making a whole array of characters, both serious and silly ones! I enjoy giving them silly voices and accents (though I may not be the best at it, but I try)!\n\nIf you were to include me in your campaign, you may get a chance to see me roleplay as a paladin pigeon (yes, literally a pigeon), originally a wizard's pet, who believes himself to be a gallant knight while not realizing that nobody takes him seriously! A miser cleric who is looking to set up her business empire! Or you may see me roleplay a much darker character, like a witch who was forced into a coven of hags in an effort to save her childhood friend, only to be met with further betrayal.\n\nI'm actually eager to try out my witch in a Pathfinder 1e setting. I've actually originally made her while eying the possibilities I can do while building her in a 1e setting, but my current Pathfinder group decided to try 2e instead. But I can do a different character if you prefer.\n\nAs I'm married, I'm not comfortable with romancing PCs or NPCs, so that's off the table. I'm fine with people romancing each other, it's just that I can't roleplay my characters doing that. But if you were to allow me to roleplay two characters, I may be able to entertain you by watching me romance myself, lol! It depends on the characters though and if you're up for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Preferences:** I prefer roleplay heavy groups, but fine with 50/50 groups. I'm fine with homebrew or no homebrew. I'm cool with making a character that's optimized or not optimized. No romancing my character's with other PCs or NPCs, but you're free to romance each other. I'm seeking an 18+ group. I prefer no camera, but I can have it on if you require it."

It would put a smile on my face with how happy their coos sounded. \n\nI have no idea if they built a nest somewhere on the roof or found a hole somewhere near the top of the house, but I assumed so with how often I would hear them. \n\nI have no idea if there's any young on the roof. I haven't heard any sounds that may sound like baby pigeons, but I don't know what baby pigeons would sound like. Do pigeons sometimes just make nests for shelter?\n\nWell, today, I went to collect the garbage bin when I noticed something odd laying near one of the trees in my yard. It looked odd and I thought a lot of gray leaves fell from the tree.\n\nWhen I got closer, I realized that those leaves were feathers. And right next to that pile of feathers was the poor bird. \ud83d\ude22\n\nI assumed it was attacked based on how much feathers there were. I looked around the body and saw that its head was gone and guts were showing. It looked like whatever attacked it just munched into it at a diagonal angle.\n\nWhat sort of predator would just eat a portion of its prey and just leave the rest of it behind? A coyote? A cat? Would a bird of prey do that?\n\nThis will be my first time dealing with having to clean up the remains of an animal. \ud83d\ude14\n\nThis has also definitely given me a fair warning about predators being in the area and I'm definitely not letting my future toy dog use the dog door that came with this house. I wouldn't have let them out without supervision, but I need to warn my husband about it in case he makes that mistake.\n\nI've been thinking about having a pigeon as well maybe in the future (but no plans right now). I would have kept my pigeon as an indoor bird either way, but this sad event has also definitely told me that there's no way in heck I'd build an outdoor aviary either.\n\n\ud83d\ude22 I just hope that it wasn't the pigeon staying on my roof and I'll still hear their happy coos in the next few days or so...\n\nI might grab a ladder to check for a nest around the roof, but I'm a bit scared with how tall the building is."

My family members playing a prank on me? (Which they almost never do unless its April fools of course.)\n\nFor further context; my dad owned a cowboy hat and some boots to go along with it.\nMaybe it was that ? But who honestly knows?"

I usually just send a casual text saying how I thought about something funny we talked about or said and saying hi, or mention that I still think they're really cool and life gets busy so sometimes conversations die but we would probably have a lot of fun goofing off or doing stuff.\n\nPeople stop talking when there doesn't seem to be steady interest, but they get interested in people who make them feel special or exciting that day the problem is that most of these apps it just dies out but I think a lot of it is just a lack of fuel for the flame but that can happen with any connection.\n\nI'm interested to know other people's styles or what has worked for them. I think the hardest part about online dating is that most things don't materialize but I think a lot of the time it is because life is hectic and lots of people don't check their apps or they get serious with someone for a few weeks or many things that aren't necessarily the door closing."

                "body": "After switching my approach I'm having a lot more success in keeping conversation going with women on apps and getting them interested in me. I went from talking to a few people a month having dry interactions or heated conversation that always trickled off disappointingly, to the opposite problem of struggling to keep up with all my texts. \n\nI apologize if some parts seem common sense- it all seems worth mentioning. Of course everyone's approach is personal but a lot of this can apply to anyone, even just making friends or growing closer to your family.\n\n  1. Sign up for several services to broaden your options. Some have better experience than others. The more specialized ones may have less users but attract better quality people.\n\n\n  2. Put some decent pictures of yourself in a good mood, enjoying something or your cute pets. Don't try too hard just show people your good side.\n\n\n  3. Make a thought out, fun or alluring profile that appeals to your people. Then go over it several times to be as concise and well worded as you can and trim the fat. If you like gamers, thick girls, dark humor, sarcastic types or whatever mention it (in a thought out way), it will save a lot of trouble. Pick a tone and work it to give people an idea of your personal language. Describe your perfect adventurous or lazy day with them, then you a have good first conversation subject!\n\n\n  4. Seek out in particular the people who you want to meet.\n\n\n  5. This may be controversial, but pay to get their attention if you must but wait for a sale cause it's a big ripoff. Some app features make a big difference however in catching someone's attention like super likes or sending a message while unmatched so it is worth considering as much as I hate to say.\n\n\n  6. If you have 'super likes' from subscribing to an app, wait to use the app when you have at least one left in case you see someone who really appeals to you.\n\n\n  7. When talking, be light, fun. Open with a personal compliment about what is so great about them to make you want them specifically! \n\n\n  8. **ALWAYS BE ASKING QUESTIONS.** Don't meander on yourself. Read their profile and figure out what subject you could get them worked up about. Treat people like a lock picking minigame. Try to keep your replies short and sweet then turn it back around to them. Let them go on. It will usually become balanced on its own. Always end with a question about them if you can. Follow up their questions with a thoughtful observation or a funny reaction and and a follow-up question. Get more specific until they are telling you stories or advice. \n\n  9. Often people will take your lead or adjust to your energy. Tease or flatter them and they will do the same. Swear or tease them and they may relax and match your playfulness. Avoid politics, economy, the news, negative subjects or being too cocky, whiny or long winded. If you are negative, guarded or low effort people will return that energy.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nOther tips that are worth mentioning \n\n  1. If it's getting late and things are slowing down after a long conversation, say how much you enjoyed your chat and look forward to the next one. Give the conversation some light closure. This accomplishes a lot by re-establishing how you feel and your enthusiasm toward them while leaving a fresh slate for the next conversation. Often people just get distracted by life however and that is fine too.\n\n  3. If things dry up a few days you can bring it back with a funny meme or question about something you talked about earlier. Ask about something they mentioned they were going to do or ask for a restaurant suggestion, send a picture of some food you cooked or your pet being cute. Mention something funny that reminded you of your earlier conversation. Do not leave walls of text or anything needy or meandering. As long as you keep it light brief and fun people are likely to open up to conversation again. If they don't message back after that move on.\n\nI hope this might help someone else who is going through the same online dating fatigue and frustrations. Feel free to give me your own comments, corrections or advice."

I have both US and Canadian based bank accounts.  \n\n\nNote: I've been trying to do my own research on taxes as a dual-citizen, however it seems to be EXTREMLY complicated.  As far as I can tell, as a US citizen, they require me to report any income I make in Canada and pay taxes on that (I believe I get tax credit for whatever I pay in canada).  The reasoning for keeping my business separate up until now has been because it's a temporary move and doing work as a US based business for US buisness with US bank accounts.  \n\n\nApologies if this is off-topic or complicated but I can't seem to find good answers."

That is the 'loser' and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner get to go to the next round.\n\nI have found that, in general, brown and red M&Ms are tougher, while the blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense ring of competition and cracks under the pressure of being in the modern candy and snack food world.\n\nOccasionally I will come across a mutation, a candy that is mishapen, pointier or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this seems to be a weakness but on very rare occassions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the candy continues to adapt in it's enviroment.\n\nWhen I finish the package, I am left with one M&M. The strongest of the herd. Since it wouldn't make any sense to eat this one as well, I package it up with a letter that says \"Please use this M&M for breeding purposes\" and send it back to M&M Mars, A division of Mars INC in Hackettstown, NJ\n\nThey wrote back this week thanking me and gve me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of M&MS.\n\nThis weekend there will be a tournament of epic protortions.\n\nThere can only be one champion.",

I found myself in a van that's riding in the sky and saw Peter Griffin and some other people there. Then then van drove down from the sky and drove on the road. We were choosing where we want to be reincarnated at. If the van stop and a per left, that means he or she wanted to be reincarnated in that place. One by one, all the people had left and only me that haven't chose one. I just realized that the van had already turned into a car and I was sitting behind the driver. I told the driver I don't know what place to choose and then the knob of the gear selector scrolled to number 1969. He said we're in 1969 Malaysia right now and I thought about the 1969 May 13th incident that happened in Malaysia so I decline that place. Then I thought about modern day Finnish's cool education system. The driver seemed like he heard my thoughts and teleported to modern day Finland. I got out of the car and turned into a baby which I thought my gender was a boy. I crawl on the tar road and saw Malaysian 8th prime minister walking along the shops. I entered a place which seems like a small company and in front of me was a receptionist asking me what name do I want and also I feel like someone picking me up.

Then, I saw the snake moved and I quickly ran away and idk how I saw the 3rd person's view but I saw the snake leap forward and bit my back.\n\nThe next scene was an omori meme which was between hero and kel. Hero in second panel talked about a snake he found in the plant(which i think is the same). Then he talked about another snake found in other places with the same image in third and forth panel. In fifth panel Hero asked Kel why there's snake everywhere. In the sixth panel Kel said something which I kinda forget.\n\nThe next scene is I saw the water rising up to my house's(same as the first scene) doorstep(what I thought in my dream was I lived at the sea and it cuts to the next scene which was in a car on a single lane highway above the city/village with my parents. My dad was driving and my mom was sitting beside me with a space in between. After a while, I saw the clouds getting darker and darker until it was as dark as near night with some bright dark blue in the sky with the clouds. Before it went very dark, I saw some towers and buildings which looked like the ones in the city surrounded by village looking houses and huts. It didn't rain and I kept saying stuff like \"Wow look at the sky! It's as dark as night\" and some other stuff. I was the only one who kept talking and my parents were silent.

In a week or 2 I'll have a 2nd PSU to try but until then I was wondering if anyone had any other suggestions.\n\nThese are the parts.\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/fCz34s)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 7 5700X 3.4 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JmhFf7/amd-ryzen-7-5700x-34-ghz-8-core-processor-100-100000926wof) | Purchased For $307.79 \n**CPU Cooler** | [ID-COOLING SE-225-XT 76.16 CFM CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/tsnypg/id-cooling-se-225-xt-7616-cfm-cpu-cooler-se-225-xt-black) | Purchased For $47.92 \n**Motherboard** | [ASRock B550 Taichi ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/jKLwrH/asrock-b550-taichi-atx-am4-motherboard-b550-taichi) | Purchased For $234.28 \n**Storage** | [Crucial MX500 2 TB 2.5\" Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/nF8j4D/crucial-mx500-2tb-25-solid-state-drive-ct2000mx500ssd1) | Purchased For $0.00 \n**Video Card** | [Asus GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11 GB STRIX GAMING Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Z8cMnQ/asus-geforce-gtx-1080-ti-11gb-video-card-strix-gtx1080ti-o11g-gaming) | Purchased For $0.00 \n**Case** | [Lian Li O11 Dynamic EVO ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/4cPQzy/lian-li-o11-dynamic-evo-atx-mid-tower-case-pc-o11dew) | Purchased For $204.44 \n**Power Supply** | [Corsair RM (2021) 750 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/R4Gbt6/corsair-rm-2021-750-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-cp-9020231-na) | Purchased For $122.47 \n**Case Fan** | [ARCTIC BioniX P140 77.6 CFM 140 mm Fan](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/djkgXL/arctic-bionix-p140-776-cfm-140-mm-fan-acfan00128a) | Purchased For $16.97 \n**Custom** | [Patriot Viper RGB Series 32GB (2 x 16GB) 3600MHz kit w/Black heatshield](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/rCxbt6/placeholder-) | Purchased For $127.79 \n**Custom** | [Arctic P12 PWM PST RGB (Pack de 3) - 120 mm - Noir](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/knddnQ/placeholder-) | Purchased For $39.40 \n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | **Total** | **$1101.06**\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2022-05-16 05:45 EDT-0400 |\n\nThe SSD and GPU were pulled from a working system so presumably they're fine but I'll try alternatives if the issue persists.\n\nI have 2 separate 8-pins going to the GPU (not daisy-chained).\n\nI have one EPS 8 pin going to the CPU but the mobo does have two 8 pin EPS ports (8 pin 12V Power Connector.) Does it matter which ATX12V you connect to? I have it connected to the one labeled \"1\" on the mobo.   I was under the impression plugging in both was unnecessary unless the CPU was OCed and using a ton of power.  I can try plugging in a 2nd one eventually.  \n\nMOBO Manual: \"This motherboard provides two 8-pin ATX 12V power connector. To use a 4-pin ATX power supply, please plug it along Pin 1 and Pin 5.  **Connecting an ATX 12V 8-pin cable to ATX12V2 is optional**\"\n\nThe BIOS version is 1.30 from 2020/8/24 and says \"2. Support AMD Ryzen\u2122 5000 Series processors\".  I would like to update it for possible better stability but not while I'm having this issue.  Perhaps I could use the BIOS flashback option while the PC is powered down but would rather try replacing the PSU first.\n\nThis isn't my first PC build but this is my first to have an issue."

I haven't reinstalled this thing in almost a decade, mostly because I did remember the hell that was getting it to work last time in win 8.1. Turns out the drivers of this thing are a nightmare, never understood quite well but I think the APU thing makes the processor and  graphic cards to share the same driver... now yes, there are drivers in the HP support site, but in a weird turn of destiny, non work, they just collapse the pc and make it impossible to boot, so that leads to a reinstall(already in the fourth one for the moment), I remember from last time I freshly installed windows the getting it to work was a weird maneuver of install and uninstall of drivers in some devilish unknown order, why? I have no idea, I just remember that after going through this same hell last time, the installing a shitton of drivers one after another for weeks end, until it worked... nooow I am tired, and I lack time to do the same thing and I can't remember the precise steps, so please help me find some drivers that work... a bit broken already from this.

I always worked hard to keep my options open, since I never knew what the future would hold. Unfortunately for me, I guess I reallyyy didn\u2019t know what the future would be like, since I certainly did not anticipate the destruction of my grades lmao. \n\nNow that I came out of my depressive slump, a part of me still wants to dream like I was previously able to. How unrealistic would Johns Hopkins, USC, UT Austin (out of state), Boston University and Rice be for me? I\u2019m looking to major in bio, biochem, or human bio as a pre-med student, and open to any school suggestions as well!\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s appropriate, but here\u2019s some additional stats just in case: \n\nACT: 32 (34 in everything except 27 in math, so I plan on retaking in September and super scoring). \n\nAPs: APES (4), Psych (5), Lang (4), Gov (3), Bio (4), APUSH (4). planning to take chem and physics next year \n\nECs:    \n- Min wage job 16 hours a week (more now that it\u2019s summer)\n\n- Was previously lieutenant governor for a Key Club division (so I would overlook like a dozen Key Clubs in the area + I chartered one at another school). 15 hrs/week last summer, then 5hrs/week over first sem junior year. I was re-elected for the current term but I was so burnt out that I stepped down after a week (mental health improved tho so yay!) I\u2019m still in Key Club but no more leadership.\n\n- Teen Council (peer-taught sex ed, basically all about prevention and staying safe)\n\n- Japanese Culture Club president\n\n- And I\u2019ll be a Youthline member moving forward (teen-to-teen crisis support helpline).\n\n- 200 ish volunteer hours. I basically didn\u2019t volunteer this past year because of my slump, but I used to live, love and breathe it lmfao so hopefully I\u2019ll get back into it this summer.\n\nOther: First gen student, mid income family, and I\u2019ll have my CNA license by the time senior year is over, thanks to the Health Careers pathway my school district offers. \n\n\nThanks!!"

After things ended completely and he was blocked, I tried to move on, meet new people, put myself out there, I've always been a very shy and antisocial, but as the time has passed I've found myself realizing more and more how important having a Dom was for me. I did meet new people, had sex with a few, but all of them either 1. Don't want a serious relationship or 2. Aren't into bdsm. Right now I find myself missing that feeling of being into a dynamic, the feeling of belonging to someone, having an owner, someone to make decisions for me and so on. I know I need to be self sufficient, but bdsm holds such a important place in my life, that when I can't practice it, something feels like it's missing inside me. Does any other sub here agree with me? Does anyone have any comforting words or anything helpful to say?"

He was the first Sir I ever had, I learned a lot with him, but now all my memories involving bdsm relate to this terrible person and I know everything will remind me of him.\n\nI just wanna know from the more experienced people in here, what are your advices to cope with this situation, how do I overcome how shitty I feel rn and how do I not feel disgusted at myself for allowing someone like that to ever be in a dynamic with me."

I started therapy in December 2020 after what was probably 6 years of me struggling mentally to get the courage to ask for help. I got diagnosed with anxiety disorder/social anxiety a couple of months later and started to be medicated and still am till this day. It was scary, I finally knew what was wrong with me and knew that I was getting professional help, but with all of that it was still very scary to start facing my fears. I had MANY ups and downs throughout these past months, even started showing signs of depression and suicidal idealizations, I finally thought I was reaching the end (and at some point even overdosed myself in hopes that I wouldn't be here anymore), but I kept going and kept trying, I did it for my family and friends, but now I can confidently say \"I am getting better!\". I did things that months ago sounded impossible, like buying things by myself instead of asking for a friend or family do it for me; Went out to meet my friends without feeling the fear of being judged by others; Sat down many times at parks to catch some sunlight all by myself; Made phonecalls; Started going out more and interacting with new people. Those things may sound stupid, but they are super important small wins to me. I feel like I can finally see a bit of hope at the end of the tunnel and now that I got a taste of what really feeling like I'm living instead of surviving is, I want to feel that again every single day.\n\nSo please, if you're asking yourself if it is worth it still trying, if starting therapy really helps, if things can really get better, I promise you, they do! I know from the bottom of my heart that it is not easy, but the feeling of finally being able to feel happy, \"alive\" again and like a independent person, is really really worth it!"

Be it trump card or not, slow hunters need a teleport on this map in case of someone using roller-coaster or just to be able to apply more pressure overall.\n\nAll mentioned hunters shouldn't have a problem with following the escaping survivor. I see you have a geisha flair, in case someone is heading towards roller-coaster, you should either knock them down before departure by placing butterly next to the cabin or simply place butterfly on the surv. Even with failing this, you still can place butterfly to next station and knock surv down when they arrive to it (there is a small pause) and even if this is failed, second butterfly to the next station will help you out.",

Sure, it's not always about winning but it's so frustrating to keep dying almost every single match. I know I am absolutely awful at looping but I don't really feel that it gets anything better. I can't even imagine how hard is it to play for solo que??? If we as swf manage to die almost always. \nI don't have the same expirience with the hunter though, most matches are a win or a tie. Sure, I also get debunked from time to time but the amount of losses is nothing in comparison to survivor. This also makes sense since survivor side is team play and if you can't coordinate properly it won't work. This is the first game where I have a feeling of not having any progress at all and this after so much time!!! I have watched YouTube videos and tutorials but it just doesn't help, I keep being downed like 40 seconds into chase. No clue how should I else improve my skill.\n\n\nDid you guys had same feelings at one point? Did it get better?"

                "body": "Hi! I didn't know where else to post this but I need to get if off my chest.\n\nFirst I have to make clear that I am a man who chooses to be celibate because of religious/spiritual reasons along with mental health issues, so the issue I am going to rant has no direct impact on me, so I believe this leaves in a position of objectivity from which I can formulate a more or less neutral and selfless opinion.\n\nDating apps are creating Incels en masse. They are creating and expanding a new bread of lonley and bitter men. Why? because of the way dating apps work. Whether we like to recognize it or not, the RedPill 80/20 theory is 100% true, and statistics support it. Most women only swipe right on 20% of men while the other 80% only seldom get a bone. This is being VERY detrimental for men's self-esteem. In counterpart, women are getting tired of getting so much matches, even women who aren't neccessarilly model-looking are getting more atention than ever, which makes the average woman extremelly picky. Don't get me wrong, everyone is entitled to be as picky as they want, I am not complaining about that. The problem here is that we are going to see an increasing wave of hateful Incels, RedPillers and the Manosphere in general.\n\nI don't believe the RedPill is wrong in their theory. I believe that their idea that women like assholes is 100% right, in which I don't agree is on **what to do** with that information. **Are all men going to become assholes in order to get laid? That would create a very shitty society to live in.** It's really disheartening to see guys who are genuinely nice turn into mysoginistic assholes with the hopes of getting laid (which btw, isn't big deal anyways). Being a good person for society is way more important (and more rewarding) than a few minutes of meaningless pleasure. \n\nNow going to back to the issue of dating apps, women are being bombarded with so many options that they don't even pay attention to the men they like. If they really like the man they matched with, they have 10 other similar guys in their inbox begging for her attention. Flaking and ghosting are going rampant. It's also worth mentioning the amount of girls who are only on apps to promote their Insta/OnlyFans or just to get ego-boosts by the amounts of likes they get.\n\nAll this creates a lot of resentement among men who just don't have what they need to get a lot of matches so they become hateful and mysoginistic.\n\nIt's very sad that dating apps have gone so mainstream. Not only that, dating IRL is becoming less and less common, with the pandemic also playing a role on that.\n\nAnother issue with apps is the algorithm they use. Tinder, for example, has algorithm that puts in a category based on how much likes you get, and your profile only gets shown to other people who have similar amounts of likes. So your profile goes buried and no one sees it.\n\nTo add on this, women on dating apps only like a certain type of man. First, the man has to be very physically attractive. But more important is their type of profile. He has to be a man that has an outdoor-sy, socially active, \"high speed\" life. If you are a nerdy introvert dating apps have nothing for you.\n\nI remember before going celibate I created a profile being 100% honest on my personality. I made clear that I like anime, videogames and heavy metal, and that I prefer to spend my free time alone. In one month I only one quality match (and some few others but didn't respond) from a geeky girl who has been traveling to Japan and we had a lot in common. Didn't respond after a while, because of course, she has 10 other guys begging for her attention. One month latter I got no matches at all, LOL.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------\n\nSo, why do I propose? This may some pessimistic for some, but far from that, I am just being realistic.\n\nMy solution to this rampant Incel problem is to **accept reallity as it is and learn to love yourself as you are.** You are not the guy who is going to be partying with model looking women every weekend, and it's ok, you are meant for other things. **Stop focusing on what you HAVE instead of what your percieved lacks.**\n\n**Start to de-normalize dating.** Fortunately, as there are more and more singles in the world, the market will start to adapt. Soon, being single will be very enjoyable. Do you know why most Japanese men choose to be single? because single in Japan is fucking awesome. Japanese culture is shaped around singleness, so being single is hella fun. In China, on the other hand, they already have a day for singles on November 11th, kinda like Valentine's but for singles. So the good thing is that dating will become less and less normal.\n\n**Understand that being single doesn't prevent you from enjoying the good things of life in any way.** In fact, you may enjoy MORE if you are single.\n\nStatistics show that people who choose to be single are happier, healthier and live longer lives. Dating is detrimental for life in terms of happiness, health and longevity.\n\nAnd don't worry about sexual pleasure. First, is not big deal. Second, sex toys are becoming more and more realistic so a real vagina will have nothing to offer. \n\nIn short, if you learn how to be happy being single, dating will become an unneccessary trouble and you won't want to do it anyway."

He showed that, while he's better at physical attacks, his special moves are much more powerful, and thus a better special attacker.\n\nThis is a problem I've come across with Luxray, which has a very High Att, yet has no access to good physicial moves besides those which give recoil damage.\n\nSo I was trying to understand, when is it better to use a counter intuitive option, like a Physical Move on a Special Attacker or vice versa? How many points of difference on the attack does it need to bridge the gap? It can't be 1 to 1 as Nidoking base Special is 17 points lower than his attack, while most of the attacks he uses is 15 points higher.\n\nIf anyone can help me with this, I'd be really grateful."

Fire:\nIt is really good from what I've seen, most Frost opponents have weakness to fire, it causes burning so it can increase DPS as it stacks, having augmented flames and aspect of terror makes it even more powerful and getting Ahzidal's mask would grant you 25% even more damage with it... (I don't really wanna use the ring, as I don't plan on using dual spells on hand most of the time).\n\n\n2. Frost:\nFrost has a really cool effect on Stalhrim weapons and chaos damage... Having Dukaan's mask, Stalhrim Sword, Augmented frost, Frost damage and Chaos damage on the sword is probably the way to make the most powerful weapon in the game, but the problem is that frost damage is very resisted in Skyrim and thus it would probably be a waste for spells even if the sword is basically the most powerful weapon in all of Tamriel, so maybe people could help me find a way to make it better?\n\n\n3. Lightning:\nIt seems to me that it is the worst element of all for a Spellsword, no enemy is weak to it, high magicka cost, no way to get a fucking gigantic damage with enchanting or anything more than Zahkriisos and Augmented shock... For a mage it is really good as you gain access to a hitscan spell, but for a Spellsword/Battlemage, I don't see it as much more useful.\n\n\nSo I'm stuck between fire and frost, but I don't know which should I use, maybe get both? Maybe get one then the other? Or really just stick to the pure element Idea, I don't really know, so if you could help me I'd appreciate it."

But then they changed it, so now it is just a smaller version of ranked and it even has an unranked mode where you play ranked without a visible rank.\n\nOverwatch has the same basic principle as Rainbow 6. Ranked is a longer version of casual, being most of the time just a change of the team that attacks or defends on that round. Basically the same as CSGO, but it is much easier to get to Ranked play after playing some casual matches.\n\nCS has the problem where casual is 10v10 instead of 5v5.\nBesides that, those other games I gave as example, has terrible ranking systems if used infinitely (They used a per season system), as it tries to hone in on where you are most likely to be even if you got better. Thus discouraging constat ranked matchmaking\n\nAll I wanted to know is, does CS have a good enough mmr system where I can play ranked without being afraid of being stuck because of previous losses (especially the ones at the start of my ranked experiences) being a big factor for the system?"

When the cousin arrived, I noticed he was young (6-8 years old) and he was dressed like a Buddhist monk! My dream self however did not seem to mind whatsoever and I treated this cousin as if he were my son. In my dream, I took him to festivals and protected him. He was adorable, but quiet! \n\nWhen I woke up I realized that 1) I don't have a younger cousin (I'm the baby of the family) and 2) that my cousin was actually the Dalai Lama from 7 Years in Tibet. \n\nI don't think I'm asking anyone to interpret this dream.

This is when I should've known to brake. The second that car passed the road, the dodo guns it and gets hit in the rear passengers side by yours truly, their vehicle doing a 180 degree spin and ending up stopped at the stop sign on the other side in the opposite lane they were driving in. Poetic justice, I say. I can only hope that her vehicle was totalled as mine was. The collision was fantastic, and the only injuries anyone sustained were both my wrists, from I suppose bracing against the steering wheel during impact.

It's only gotten worse the past year; my insecurities just keeps getting worse and worse and I don't know why. I don't know why this even started, a year ago.\n\nEvery time I'm (F22) alone (not with friends irl or online), I feel anxious. I can't even pinpoint WHY, but I'm constantly checking if someone \"that would want to be with me\" (so even if many are online, i dont consider everyone) is online on discord when I'm home, even excluding my closest friends right now because I'm scared they find me boring. Every time I talk with people these days, I analyze every single little thing to see if there's any indication that they are bored, or simply in any sort of negative mood whatsoever. If it wasn't obvious, I'm also a overthinker - aware that I'm probably wrong most times, but it doesn't stop my anxiety. I don't do anything when I'm alone these days; I just have anxiety and desperately search for human interraction in any way, judging everyone I know by \"would they feel even a slightest doubt of saying yes\", then I won't ask, because 99% yes and 1% no for me is basically \"they don't want to and I shouldn't burden them with my presence\", which is dumb, I don't know why I can't just ask. If they say no, they say no, right? Doesn't have to be about me being boring... yet here I am.\n\nBasically I have two problems that connect. I am desperately afraid of being abandoned by friends and ending up alone (I want to be with people literally all the time - this wasn't the case a year ago), and I am afraid to be boring. Being boring to me, leads to them abandoning me, thats why I'm saying it connects. I always compare my personality with other peoples, and think \"why can't I be more like that? That person is liked by a lot of people...\", extra for girls that are liked (because I am female - I hang out with mostly boys though).\n\nI think this made me suddenly develop something similar to social anxiety. With newer friends or strangers, I am afraid of not fitting in, or not giving a good impression, not being as fun or interesting as they were hoping or thinking. The friend group I found a year ago, about when this started, I met for the first time just a few weeks ago. I felt like shit going home after that, because I was so stressed because I didn't feel like I was fun enough, and that they lost interest in being my friend after that. Nothing has actually changed after it, but I'm still sitting here like I am, feeling like shit about every small thing. Trying to be someone I'm not. \n\nI check for differences in a person's attitude towards me. Are they even the slightest more hostile or not-as-happy? I must have done something disappointing, or not done *enough*. I always compare their attitude towards me now from before (doesnt matter what time), and if I talk to someone late at night before bed, and I remember them laughing and acting normal towards me, it makes me content and I automatically think \"now tomorrow they probably will not mind if I were to ask to hang out\", or \"if I join the call tomorrow, they won't hate it\". Cus that's also a thing; I isolate myself from group calls quite often, like right now as well, in case someone doesn't want to talk with me. \n\nI'm writing this for the exact reason that I *am* feeling lonely, and not daring to ask if anyone wants to hang out irl or online. I'm just... looking for any sort of compassion, or anyone that maybe relates, or at least simply any sort of human interraction (since I'm a coward with my actual friends) that I have come to be obsessed with."

I began to wonder if the original was so small as well and I only remembered it as longer, or something is going down here.\n\nAfter crying to an ending again and rolling through end credits, Steam told it took me 26h to complete the whole story.\n\nIt's really disappoint that a 60-dollar game (on release)\nfeels really cut-down on content and is almost a half shorter than its predecessor.\n\nAlthough, I absolutely don't mean that the length is a main criterion of a game's quality, but the whole LiS:TC main story feels very incomplete and just unsatisfying, like Deck Nine halfway through the development realized that they don't have enough funds to complete the vision they had at the start.\n\nWhat do you think about all this?"

Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.  \n>  \n>But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.",

The answer to both is the same. You have to go through a PROCESS and then you have to ACT. The only difference between both goals is that there is a slider of difficulty, but the basic principle holds true. Allow me to explain.\n\nExample. You want to eat. You either cook for yourself, eat what's available or have someone make it for you or feed you. You dont moan, you just act, plain and simple. And what are you rewarded with? a satiated stomach. No matter what the situation is, someone had to act in some sort of way for real results. Big problems are the same way. \n\nEffective action follows a plan. A plan forms from logical thought in aiming for a goal. The goal was set by your desire. A strong desire is the foundation for success and good habits that point you toward your goal are the building blocks. But the BLUEPRINT from day fucking one is a very simple yet profound word. GRATITUDE. Count your blessings because all of us here have a shit tonne.\n\nGratitude you have your 5 senses (don't get me started on the amount of things these alone allow us to do, experience and enjoy). Gratitude that you are privileged enough to live in a developed country. Gratitude that you have the internet. Gratitude that you are literate enough to read what I'm writing rn. Gratitude you have fresh water to drink and hot food to eat. Gratitude everything is so convenient you can even feel depressed about the simple problems that really arent that big a deal even a week from today and countless others. This is ground zero. Anyone that truly masters gratitude will always have the mindset to grow and will never truly be depressed. \n\nExactly 0 percent of people that have ever bitched and moaned and decided to feel sorry for themselves and roll into a ball to hide have ever got their problem solved in the end without some form of action, no matter how insignificant. Hell, scratching your back requires you stretch to get the itch. Everything else getting imbetween your desire and then to start acting serves as a detour making your journey for real change longer than it needs to be.\n\nThe same world that lets both rich kids inherit billions and some nameless poor African starve, with nothing but the rags on their back, breathe the same air also doesnt care whether you grow or not. To the extent if you ever  become a billionaire, you simply become another statistic. And if you die a miserable gruesome death, that's also simply another statistic. We arent special and our problems arent unique. They have been solved before and can be solved again.\n\nSo if life gives that little amount of shits about us individual folk, the only answer is you act in your best interest and for your own self fulfillment because who is actually left if you arent there for yourself. That is all.\n\nThx for reading :)"

We were arrested and during our court hearing, one of our other friends came with this machine. Then we wanted to escape, but some guy wanted us to escape on the ground, as opposed to flying, because the vehicle was too heavy. I told him we had to fly or else we\u2019d get caught quickly.\n\nDuring takeoff, some people fell off, but all the convicts (me and 2 other guys) stayed on the machine. We then went to a petrol station, and before we could buy anything, we saw a policeman telling the security guard at the petrol station to look out for us. We rushed to the machine and flew off. \n\nThen we went to a lake cause these 2 other guys hadn\u2019t seen it, and the road leading to that lake was the same road leading to my home. We went to a small shop and got some stuff to eat (I didn\u2019t eat because I wasn\u2019t hungry). I walked away from the other 2, they were sitting at the machine eating. I started to feel sad, because I knew I could never go home, since I was an outlaw. I started thinking about turning myself in, but realized I couldn\u2019t, as the judge had talked about life imprisonment when I was in the hearing.\n\n Just then, I remembered that in real life I wasn\u2019t a criminal, and the dream became lucid. I started running to try and escape, and a crack in the world opened to reveal these rotating poles each with small foot parts. I was jumping on each of the correct foot paths, and a song I liked started playing.\n\nThe song finally ended and I woke up to see a large metal thing next to my bed. This time I thought I had actually woken up, and went outside to find it was night time. I came back inside and saw my brother\u2019s snake, and I was content with it all, like all of it was real. I then remembered something I had to do, and woke up for real this time. Possibly the most disorienting dream I\u2019ve ever had."

I found that I could identify with most of the experiences other people had, and it all made sense all of a sudden.\n\nNow, in my country, mental health is nothing short of a joke. Regardless, I told my mother about ADHD and the symptoms, and everything I had found about it. I asked her if we could get a professional diagnosis, to which she agreed, and we got onto the waiting list for a psychiatrist.\n\nI usually spend about 10 hours on my computer daily for things like online school and mostly leisure. Recently, I've barely been able to control myself, and the 10 became 12. This is definitely unhealthy, and I'm working on spending less time on the computer by getting other hobbies, doing other stuff, et cetera.\n\nLast night, I was agreeably up on the computer too late, and my mother walked into my study, to tell me to go to sleep. She then got angry, because I had spent the past few weeks spending all day and night on the computer. In a fit of rage, she proceeded to utter these words:\n\n*\"All these things you're consoling yourself with, ADHD and whatnot, they aren't true. The real problem is that computer!\"*\n\nI think those few words were some of the most hurtful and angering I've heard in my lifetime."

We were still talking everyday, but we weren't playing games together or anything. I got hit with some seasonal depression, and he told me that he was feeling numb to me, that he didn't feel anything. Though he claimed to still love me.\n\nI figured he'd get over it before long, but it doesn't seem like it. We still feel distant, and it fucking sucks. The last few days I've really been trying to reignite our spark, but he's not engaging. Time zones are an issue, he's 6 hours ahead of me, but even when we're both up, we still don't do much. He runs from serious conversations, so I can't really talk to him about it. He hasn't even been saying that he loves me unless I deliberately prompt him to. Idk what to do. I still love him, I don't want to end things, especially since I'm terrified of being alone. But I don't know if we can recover from this. I don't know if he even wants us to recover from this"

I'm learning how to build a race track for Assetto Corsa on a GIS map; however I've found that the roads are too bumpy. Like extremely bumpy. GIS and OSM give the same result. I'm modeling Brescia's viale Venezia, one of the main roads of a big city. IRL the road is a regular smooth city street.\n\nSo far, to test the track I've raised it and moved that problem for later. But here we are. Shrinkwrap modifier made the car jump like a rally car, and in some places the road goes below the terrain. Every tutorial I've watched concerns mountain roads, where you can raise it and add things on the side to cover it (you can merge it with the vegetation) or smooth surfaces to begin with.\n\n1) Should I smooth the terrain and how?\n\n2) Do you have any other suggestion?"

I have the sub-threshold one.\n\nI apologize for the long text. I need to vent and can't stop my hands from typing.\n\nSeven years ago, I had a major depressive episode. For the first time in my life I went to a psychiatrist and a few months later to psychotherapy. There were no doubts about the diagnosis, along with moderate Social Anxiety Disorder. I got out of depression after the paroxetine did its work, and for a while all looked good, for only the second time in my life.\n\nI've only been happy two times: one between 2005/2006 (it stopped suddenly at the beginning of 2007, like a switch) and the other one while on SSRI between late 2014 and early 2016. During those two years, however, I started having problems with my meds, I had some lows but generally I thought I was good. I thought I was normal. After that, I had a second major depressive episode, switched to Wellbutrin + a mood stabilizer (sodium valproate, it's called Depakin here in Italy) and again I felt better.\n\nOver time I got worse again, thanks to anxiety and a melancholic temperament. I had what I called \"mediums and lows.\" Those didn't feel like major depression, they only had a few features. The term **\"treatment-resistant depression**\" was said while adjusting the dosages. Wellbutrin 300 gave me bad anxiety; Wellbutrin 150 gave me depression. Going back to 300 fixed it again overnight, but Covid lockdown came ten days later and couldn\u2019t see the results. I felt good during the quarantine, but I think it was down to feeling like everybody else.\n\nIn May, one week after the lockdown ended, I started to experience **very rapid cycles** (every 10 days) of depression and medium-okay mood (that means: having energy... but angry energy: Wellbutrin exaggerates my anger, which I normally repress. I don\u2019t see having anger very well, so even if I have energy, I put myself down with guilt). That lasted until August, when I had 10 days of an even worse depression (felt like the major one). Then got better again, and now for the first time I suspect myself that I may have hypomania. BUT NOT QUITE.\n\n**In fact, according to my psychotherapist, I've always had dichotomic thoughts and energy. According to my psychiatrist, I could be either Bipolar Type 2 or treatment-resistant.** (Today he revealed he thought I could also be dysthymic or cyclothymic). According to my younger self, I could very well be dysthymic, as **I have the ups and downs like switches, but they\u2019re mostly downs, and the ups are never that up.** So, I always denied the bipolar hypothesis. My doctors were never sure about it either, so they kept monitoring and taking care of my mental health the best way they could. In the long run, I grew confused and lost all hopes.\n\nToday, after I explained the rapid cycle thing, my psychiatrist said: *\"*You have a classic case of **cyclothymia**.\" Stupid me knew the term, but somehow didn't figure out it was a type of Bipolar. The exact type of Bipolar that explains why my ups are never so up. I.E. **Being bipolar without the fun stuff.** Apparently, I've always been like that since I was 9, I had the sub-threshold hypomania in those two happy times in my life, depression has been sub-threshold most of the time (another term it was used since the very beginning). **He said that cyclothymia is like depression winning over hypomania.**\n\nI went home enlightened. Everything started to click. Even the terms and the metaphors I unconsciously used all my life were contemplated in the description. I watched Dr Tracey Marks' video on cyclothymia and almost cried because of how fitting it was.\n\nThen I opened Reddit and got confused again. It\u2019s like if most of you are describing the ups as hypomania, instead of sub-threshold, which to me is something that can be easily mistaken for being normal, only slightly wrong. That means I don't relate to that and possibly I have no clue about what hypomania is. Then, it turns out that hypomania should be present half of the time. I don't think that's my case, but I\u2019m not entirely sure. I'm mostly depressed, I'm lucky if I have one good month a year. Or that\u2019s what I think I see the most. I accept that I can be wrong.\n\nThat prompted me to look at DSM V. Apparently, to be diagnosed you should have never had major depression... which I had. Twice. In that case, you go to Bipolar 2, but it doesn't fit because my hypomania is sub-threshold.\n\nMy therapist would be mad at me for this post, as I should stop overthinking everything. But the question is: **can anyone relate with feeling depressed most of the time, and switching suddenly to semi-normality for a brief period?**"

Although both were loved by their parents, Yandere always perceived her sister as receiving more love and appreciation, making her jealous. One day, during an argument, she finally exploded and in a burst of rage, accidentally killed her sister. Panicking, she burned the body and spread the remains in several places of the woods surrounding the small town they live in, lying to her parents (who came back from a summer vacation) by claiming her sister disappeared. No one ever found out the truth.\n\nYears later, she matured into a gorgeous lady who was both kind and helpful, being appreciated by everyone. It was in that same period she started dating a guy. At first, nothing was off about him and that made her feel safe about sharing her guilty secret with him. Bad choice. \n\nAfter taking hold of the information, his attitude towards her shifted into one of abuse and backmail, in which he would threaten to reveal it to the general public of the small town if she didn't comply to his demands. The nature of said demands can be easily imagined. The girl was now suffering from both traumatic guilt and outside pressure surrounding it.\n\n***And that's when she met her future darling.***\n\nAt first, he seemed to be no more than a troublemaker; beating bullies all around and making history on the second day of entering the school. She didn't think much of him... Quite forgettable, as most likely was just like all other dudes.\n\nThat would change in a couple weeks when, due to story plot reasons, said guy would battle and defeat her abusive ex-boyfriend, setting her free of his grasp.\n\nShe started stalking him, trying to learn more about that dude and then finally interferring when he was being cornered by a much larger group of bullies. That's how they met.\n\nHer gratitute grew into admiration, and admiration into an urge to help in his goal; of being his confidant and helper, the pillow he could rest his head on after a tough battle, the arms that would embrace and give him their heat. She wanted him to rely on her.\n\nHe was always overwhelmed by responsibility, tired - she could tell from just looking. But he would always say \"Nah. I'm fine!\" and force a smile.\n\nBut always, she would ensure him of that unchangeable fact. He could always count on her for anything - *anything really*.\n\n***But he never did. Instead, he went after her.***\n\nShe could feel nothing but spite for that girl. That haughty, condescending attitude... All those shallow friendships... and especially, the way she treated him when he was just trying to be so kind, sending dozens of her little \"cult followers\" to take him down. She was hateful, irredeemable.\n\nBut what hurt more was just how invested he was in helping her. She beat him, almost killed him - but he still went and saved that monster from the lies she told herself. He was amazing, yes, but why for that girl?\n\nHe was *her* hero. He was *her* savior. He was *hers*.\n\nAnd then, there was that rotten voice, always ringing by her ear.\n\n***\"No matter who you become. No matter how kind you look on the outside. No matter how many you help. Nothing changes the fact it was your fault.\"***\n\n***\"Did you enjoy the new love of our parents for you? They hug you so much more tightly now, don't they?\"***\n\n***\"When are you going to tell them, sister? When are you going to let me stop burning? It hurts to breathe...\"***\n\nIt was only when she was by his side that Sister would stop talking and muttering those hurtful words. He would keep her away with that calm smile and kind words. When she hugged him, that dead voice would finally shut up.\n\nBut only for so long, as it didn't take long to start again after he was gone.\n\nShe needed him so badly and nobody will get in her way... Not even his beloved sister, who just started  subtly warning him of her \"unhealhy adoration\", as she says.\n\nShe would be next to *her* hero, no matter what."

But, can it get any better?***  \nSo we got two characters: Ryan and Phoebe. They fit in a scenario where Ryan is supossedly seen as the hero and Phoebe, one of the arc antagonists... Or at least it would be that way, if I hadn't nuanced both their motivations for doing what they do.\n\n***FOR THE SAKE OF SOME CONTEXT ON BOTH OF THEM...***\n\n* Ryan is an amnesiac with the power to read memories of others. Remembers nothing before age 12 and is constantly seeking his previous identity. His motivations lie in protecting the ones he regards as friends and, in second place, trying to \"re-discover\" himself somehow. During the course of his \"new life\", had to change address every few weeks, and thus could never stay in one place for long enough to form true friendships. Has a caring, but busy older sister, and a distant mother, who is almost never home. Ryan deeply resents the fact he can't fully reciprocate his sister's love, due to not remembering a single thing of his childhood. The few weeks with the others characters formed moments held dearly, to the point he could sacrifice to save his \"first true friends\".\n* On the other hand, we have Phoebe; a girl with a loving mother, but a neglectful father she was always trying to please as a child. At the age of 9, said father left for good, leaving her mother seriously depressed. The combination of neglect, abandonment and severe bullying at school (that lasts for years) made her grow to be a bitter, hateful and resentful person, trusting nobody but her mother, which tries hard to remain strong for the sake of her daughter. Later on, Phoebe gains a power to manipulate biology, which she uses to get revenge and \"rise in life\".\n\n***So, for the plot:***\n\nPhoebe manipulated her own biology to create a new form, adopting an alter ego: Becky.  \nBecky is beautiful, likeable and desirable. Everything about this new figure is amazing and great - except the whole scheme behind that facade, that boils down to Phoebe using this new face and powers to get torturous revenge against all the bullies and also the ones that ignored her suffering.\n\nRyan proves specially antagonistical of her plans and steps in, confronting Becky. He wins, leaving the girl disraught over the fact she wasn't the only one \"gifted\" with such powers.\n\n... Then she gets caught in some major plot and ends up being coerced by an actual antagonist to kill Ryan; or else, footage of her \"metamorphosis\" would leak worldwide.\n\nAngry due to being forced but still favourable enough to comply, she once more tries to confront Ryan... and ends up overwhelmed by numbers, as other students with powers - Ryan's friends - show up.\n\nGrowing desperate, she once more confronts him... only to realize Ryan used his own power to read her memories and learn about her motivations.\n\nHe opposes her idea of revenge, saying there is a better way to solve the problem, and that they could join forces to fight the mastermind behind all that. Ryan says he knows it all - how she feels, what she went through... and assures the girl that giving up on her identity to become someone new (Becky) is not the way to go.\n\nShe pays no heed to his words, jumping in for a fight.\n\n... and Ryan ends up being saved once more by everyone, leaving Phoebe to see that all along she was alone, and that the people never truly loved her; they loved Becky.\n\nIn a rush of desperation and taking it as an absolute lose, Phoebe attempts to take herself out by drowning, but ends up being saved by Ryan, and they once more end up arguing.\n\nRyan points all the good things she has (a loving mother - which he lacks - being the most important of them) as well as reasons to live and fight. The two continue clashing in words for some time before Phoebe is finally forced to give up.\n\n***And the points I'm going for are:***\n\n1. **Ryan's obstinate idealism and abstract hopeful message, directly facing concrete and raw revenge, pain and neglect.**\n2. **Phoebe's lifelong frustrations being miraculously \"cured\" by Becky's existance, reaching horizons of quality of life she could only dream of.**\n3. **Her underlying insecurity concerning Becky (aka: \"they love her, not me\") and prospect that the only way for true happiness and love from others is by \"embodying\" that Alter Ego.**\n4. **Ryan (who we are supposed to see as the \"hero\") being portrayed as the villain from Phoebe's perspective.**\n5. **Ryan's search for himself directly clashing Phoebe's abandonment of herself.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, any tips on how to possibly improve this?"

The power always represents the person, be it:\n\n1- Massively amplifying an existing trait or expertise (a dancer acquires a movement-based skill);  \n2- Covering a weakness/need (someone who doesn't walk gain a skill that creates \"ghost limbs\" or so);  \n3- Reflecting an aspect of character (a timid person may gain a power that gets stronger as they gain confidence).\n\nSo this guy (a minor antagonist) is considered a type 2 (weakness/need) ability-user. Shortly put, he is just your regular sexually unsuccessful modern man, who happens to come across the power-granting substance and proves compatible with it, this gaining **the ability to romantically control women.**\n\n* It is triggered by touch; any woman he comes in contact with, brief as it may be, will immediately fall for him.\n* The effect works on any woman, regardless of previous relationship status, sexual preferences, previous opinion on the user or even age.\n* The \"infected\" woman will reach an impossible level of infatuation with the power-bearer, losing all sense of rationality and blissfully obeying any command given by him, regardless of its nature - and I mean it. They are also deeply protective of the ability-user.\n* The women under his spell cannot be reasoned with or talked out of loving him, even if heavy evidence of amoral acts is shown, as the feeling of \"love\" will always negate any chance at critical thinking.\n* And lastly, killing the power-user or permanently placing them apart won't cause the effects to disappear, and the woman will be left in a hopeless state of bottomless depression for the rest of her life.\n\nThe guys we have to fight him with are:\n\n* Memory-manipulating boy who can look deep into your soul.\n* Illusion-user chap, who can also kick some butts.\n* Firebender lad and his pepper breath.\n* And last, but not least, Copycat fella, capable of copying any other skill for 5 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo guys... Any tips?"

I'm also considering Motorola Moto G 5G Plus but I'm not sure if Motorola provides regular updates compare to Samsung.\n\nAs for the usage, I hope what I'll buy has quality camera/s, display (since I stream a lot), good battery life, earphone jack and would provide security & OS support for a couple of years. I don't really prioritize gaming but it's still nice if the processor is pretty good as I expect to use it for next 3-4 years.\n\nBtw, I'm based on the Philippines if that helps. Thank you. :D"

Where often the winds have swept my atoms to the bodies of   \nevery life form imaginable, I now lay in line with the law of strength,   \nthe law of power, the law of self-respect. For even when the carbon in   \nmy cells was Cheetah, pouncing onto the earthquake of tumbling beast   \nknown as dinner, my bones felt like a ship being battered at sea. Now   \nnot, My God, now I know what it is to be strong and balanced. Now I know  \n what it means to be connected to the universe. It requires a small   \nreality to feel the connection between your gracefully cascading mass as  \n it dances through the cosmos and the arena of living beings. However,   \nit does not require smallness to know the connection between your divine  \n grace and living as a being.\u00a0 \u00a0 I can feel every other being in   \nexistence through you, my God. When my atoms were a man, I could but   \nfeel my own hands, perhaps the sound of a tree somewhere off in the   \nforest, or the sound of my own breath, but never would I presume to know  \n where a tap-pole felt its' center of consciousnesses. As a simple film   \ndiffusely-lain within the nooks and crannies of the most massive,   \ncontinuous system around, I can choose to see each bird leaving the safe  \n attraction of your fertile trees and I know when they land; tired,   \ngrateful, and unaware of the true strength of their grand foundation;   \nyou, My God. I can infer when you are sinking into yourself to produce   \nanother wet divot in which to build life, and I can feel the tickle of   \nyour skin being constantly stretched by hundreds of glaciers. As a man   \ndomesticates, a planet processes and rotates, and a grand universal   \nforce permeates the plane of the living. My God, thank you for this day.  \n Man must compensate the same way you; carry what he must, rest where he  \n can. It holds together the heaven and the earth, by your grace, and   \nwill calm the spirit of man in this, the final push of our birth into   \nthe post-scarcity eras.\u00a0 \u00a0 But post-scarcity is tantamount to   \npost-freedom. In our infancy, we have built a world around closing our   \nears, and that blindness has been our freedom. Now, as we approach the   \ncritical mass of available information, we are ripped open to a new   \nunderstanding. Our inability to listen has been torn away, and our ears   \nare wide open to the massive holes in our world. Epstien's island,   \nGihslain Maxwell, Bill Gate's creepily accurate predictions of who would  \n develop the vaccine before there was even a need for one. This world   \nis, as we realize now, defined by the child with the most money and   \nability to deafen people through cognitive dissonance. We would like it   \nto be defined by the pleasant imagination of the middle-ages peasant. We  \n would maybe even like the world to be defined through the knight's eye,  \n a land of warriors making pacts with and against other warriors,   \nbecause that reality would be less painful that 1000 years of high level  \n espionage and erosion of cultural and spiritual ties to a higher   \nreality. So what happens when all the information is out there, My God,   \nand we only have our own earplugs to blame? We become bound by our own   \nregrets, misguided by naive appraisals of the depths of human apathy and  \n greed, and chained on both wrists with denial and fear of an economic   \nsystem that gives ample berth to manipulation and coercion through   \nsymbology and belief. How do we remove these chains, My God? Acceptance?  \n Cunning? Time?\u00a0 \u00a0 I am but a small covering on your ever-reaching   \nbody, My God. I am leaving Plato's cave and turning my eye outward, but   \nthe shear unmanipulated brightness of freedom is deafening to me. What   \nis the oculus of perception which I can dilate to exist in this new,   \npost-information-scarcity world cohabited by leeches and mockingbirds?   \nRiddled with secrets and only one bad nap away from waking up in that   \nreactive, lie of a cave again? Possibly never to remember that is was a   \nwell planned show? Oh. Oh, what's that? That's my eye. It's contacting. I  \n can question things without feeling like I'm betraying a position, or a  \n person. I actually, question everything, as a matter of course, as a   \nmatter of respect. I question how I question, and what that can lead to   \ngiven different initial conditions and known variables\u00a0 This is, I can   \nsee, this is wonderful! Oh Thank You My God! I can dance, I can sing, I   \nam no longer bound to the foolish karma of unenlightened men. I spin   \nmerrily upon the surface of your magnificent womb and thank you for each  \n day above ground, ever sweeter coming out of the swamp. Thank you My   \nGod, for giving me eyes with which to see, hands with which to feel, and  \n a heart wise enough to love the whole of creation. Thank you, My God.   \nThank you.",

Its really funny and the plot is actually quite interesting! However, it's very \"slowburnish\" in the sense that it's been over 250k words I think and they still haven't kissed.

Their parents are homophobic and they have no lock on their door. And we also have a busy schedule. We call each other so little that when we have a call scheduled, I'm nervous. \n\nSecond, we're both awkward. Very, very awkward. I'm autistic and they may be too. When we get on the phone, it's sometimes hard to keep the conversation fluid. They told me they never talked to anyone more than 10 minutes on the phone before me. As for texts... I don't like texts because I hate being the last one sending a message. I know it's stupid. Also, I feel awkward when the conversation is going back to back and the person answer immediately. The only person I feel comfortable texting like that is my best friend, but we've been friends for like 7 years now. I can spam him about whatever I want whenever I want. I wanna be like that with my girlfriend too. \n\nThird, the language. We both speak english really well but we have an accent so it's kinda hard to understand each other sometimes. \n\nDo you have any advice on getting more comfortable? Or should I just let time take care of it? I really want my girlfriend to be the person I feel the most comfortable with\n\nTl;Dr: my gf and I are both autistic and awkward so it's kinda hard to have fluid conversations together and to look forward to calls instead of being nervous, I wanna improve that"

UGH.\n\nshe also asked if i been taking my meds, and ofc not because metformin tastes HORRIBLE and birth control can affect cortisol levels (i thought i was gonna get my urinary cortisol test yesterday)!! THEN SHE TELLS ME THAT BIRTH CONTROL DOESNT AFFECT CORTISOL LEVELS. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! THERE IS LITERALLY RESEARCH THAT STATES TO AVOID BIRTH CONTROL OR ESTROGEN DURING THE PROCESS OF CORTISOL TESTING!\n\nanywaysssss she just thinks i have PCOS AS ALWAYS and just prescribes me metformin with BC and tells me to \u2728exercise and diet\u2728 \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d such wise words!! and the fucking doctors evaluation literally said polycystic ovaries LIKE I DON\u2019T EVEN HAVE CYSTS ON MY OVARIES?!! \n\nsome endocrinologists DO NOT DESERVE THEIR JOB! i hate my life :)"

SJW movement seemed to rise up a bit more and looked into things that were not really publicly discussed before (that i have saw). a lot of gen z started maturing and becoming apart of the LGBTQ+ community. one of the more topics of the community is really about gender identity, but they have never really focused on intersex issues and only spiral it around trans issues.\n\ndon\u2019t get me wrong, trans issues are valid enough to care for and discuss and doesn\u2019t necessarily bother me, but the issue is that people try to tie in my issues along with validating trans identities. my gender dysphoria is not the same as theirs. i never had a decision and exploration with my hormones and looks, they just came naturally. trans people don\u2019t choose their dysphoria, but at the same time, it\u2019s not the same as me having my condition. \n\nyes there are bearded women, but at the same time, i\u2019ve never seen a trans women with a beard, and at the same time, people tend to idolize more feminine figures rather than others these days. as well as to mention, i never went to a doctor to prescribe me testosterone. some trans people have that decision. so please, instead of tying my issues in with trans issues, just speak up for the intersex community alone. \n\nit\u2019s not illegal to say we\u2019re different than trans peoples experiences. even though we deal with gender issues, it\u2019s not the same. i wish my issues were simply more aware to people instead of being viewed on a post about trans people. maybe even speak up on a post about intersex individuals who are trans.\n\nsorry that this is long i\u2019ve just been bottling this up."

So if that was the case she was born in 1694/1695 (1994/1995)\n\nTom: Same age as Star and Marco\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, this is just my opinion, if there's a mistake please let me know(English isn't my first language), feel free to share your opinion."

The only ones who \"help\" are my fmAunt, and only when asked out of extreme need. NBrother only comes around when Grandma has fallen, and then he comes over with zero notice and messes up our schedule and it drives me BANANAS. Absolutely none of them have ever offered to take her to Dr.s appointments, give me a break and have some time to myself, nothing like that. I'm at my wits end with everything. I've taken care of her, by myself, for seven years. I'm only 33. So, I thought about calling a \"family meeting\" \ud83e\udd2e and shaming them all. See if I can shame them into helping. Thoughts? Fyi I am VLC with my nMom. We only talk when she finds out through my aunt that something happened to my grandma."

(That's actually a jab, because she knows I no longer tell her when my Grandma's in the hospital . . . It's a whole stupid thing)\n\nBack in January when estepdad had Covid and I had a broken right arm in a cast, we found we couldn't cook meals. Estepdad didn't want to give me Covid and I couldn't cut anything up.\n\nAre you guys in need of meals assistance? I'm actually providing a meal for a friend who just had major surgery and her daughter tomorrow but I can make a double portion or drop off whatever you need. Please let me know.\n\nI hope you're not too ill. Let me know if you need any medicine or anything.\"\n\nI am very low contact with her. Like, life threatening situations only, contact with her. So when she does text me I try to keep it as brief as humanly possible, which is extremely hard for me. So I texted her back and said thank you for dinner, I'm going to have seconds now etc. \n\nThen tonight . . . My grandma pops her head in and asks if I want dinner, someone just dropped it off. Sure? Long story short, my nmom made dinner again, this time all my \"favorite\" foods. (Going based off the last time she knew anything about me, roughly 15 years ago.) My grandma was acting all weird and I finally got out of her that she talked to my nmom that morning and nmom wanted to keep it a secret \ud83d\ude44 Also, I still believe I was an afterthought, that she was making it for that other person and just made extra.

I don't want to text it.\"\n\nI don't want to call her. What should I do? What would you do?\n\nUPDATE: I texted her back after waiting 4 hours and said the following:\n\n\"I won't be able to talk any time soon, as long as I know it's big/bad news coming, I don't mind - you can just tell me via text.\"\n\nAnd she hit me back with:\n\n\"I don't want to put it in writing.

It shouldn't take long\u2014it's just informational.\"\n\nTo which I replied: \n\n\"Ok, like I said I'm not able to talk right now, but if you don't want to text it, you can call and leave me a voicemail.\"\n\nIt's been over 24 hours now and she has not responded.

There's a definite creepy son/husband blurred line vibe. Her other son even calls them \"Mr. And Mrs. Bates\". Anyway, I'm plowing through the show, still only a few episodes in.

But, social structure we created masculine things and feminine things. You can only be a man or you can only be a woman. Sure there are exceptions like intersex but those are technically biological malfunctions and should be treated just like any other exception in life. But that does not mean they can change the entire basis of a social structure. I do not see a logical way how someone can feel outside of being a man or a woman when in life those are the only two rules you can really be. but with that being said, why can\u2019t someone feel like they\u2019re 60 years and they actually are? Age is significantly less important than gender and we can we cannot change it. so what makes you think that you can change something more important than that?",

I was waiting for him on the first row of seats, and after going to the back to talk with his classmates, he approaches me and gives me the balloon. \n\nHe knows about my fear, and I think he's a little \"phobic\" too, to a certain level. \n\nBut instead of sharing how I felt in the moment outside, I'm asking myself, why part of me was still scared of the balloon but the other part was willing to receive it? \nI know it's a foil balloons, those don't pop so easy and loudly, but I was still scared of it.\n\nOn the other side, I wanted that balloon from the moment I saw it fly away to the ceiling, and for some reason, I was waiting for this friend to gave it to me, I saw it, and I wanted it, from him, even tho I was scared of it, maybe it's the symbolism of the red heart? It's the fact that it was the first time I could have a balloon without the fear of the taboo that represented my fear from other people I know? (A.K.A. My family) It was a foil balloon at the end of the day. Why did the balloon floated away in the second function but not in the first one? It was supposed to be for me?\n\n\nSometimes the universe can smile at us and good things happen.\nIt doesn't matter, at the end, a good friend gave me a balloon, and for the first time, I was happy for holding it.\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n(My real experience from some weeks ago, at the end of December.

I'm a beginner piano player with experience in other instruments, some parts of reading piano sheet music are still a bit hard for me to grasp.\n\nAs a \"rule\" I've seen that each staff goes to each hand, some sheets seem to be written with this idea in mind while others seem to just want to separate melody and accompaniment. But then I saw this piece of music, mainly from bars 7 to 38:\n\nhttps://musescore.com/starsoarer/the-ancient-vessel\n\nIt is clear to me that the lower cleff plays chords to the melody in the upper cleff. Yet very often, mainly after bar 23 when the upper cleff turns into a bass cleff too, both hands play the same notes, or if not the same, very close or with awkward switches of the left hand over to the right of the right hand.\n\nSo far, I've been ignoring what should be each hand and just have been playing it in whatever way feels easier at each point in the song, like playing many of the trilled chords with the right hand because \"it's already there anyway\" instead of jumping with the left hand.\n\nI get that this is written by an user on Musescore adapting something from other instruments and all that. So with this in mind. Should I now:\n\n* \"Man up\" and play it like it's written, even if it feels very awkward to me now, later on it's something that I need to be able to do.\n* Take it as the user who wrote it, wrote it in an awkward way that should not happen often, so I should not care much.\n* Continue to play it mixing both hands like I've been doing, trying to play the melody slightly louder so it doesn't get entangled in the chords as easily.\n\n\nAnd if it matters, I have taken piano lessons, it's just that I no longer do because of Covid. So I'm not in contact with my teacher to keep asking these questions."

But recently, It would shut-down and restart when playing some games, even ones that it had no problem running before. I looked at temperatures and they seemed fine with cpu never going much over 55C. I'd stress test and it would be perfect, but 3 seconds into a game map it would reset again. It seemed to happen not as often after I downclocked my GPU with afterburner, (980mhz to 800)\n\nI took it to a tech support shop and the dude said he found nothing faulty testing one by one, but my cpu was overheating, so he told me to install a water cooler.\n\nI bought a water cooler and a SSD and am waiting for the delivery, but as of now, I cannot even use my computer anymore. its not just games, a simple firefox with 2 tabs open crashes (at random, not at opening). I can open Android Studio fine, but as soon as I start to edit something, just adding a few lines, crashes again. There is no error message, its just goes off, and starts again.\n\nIt seems to be getting worse and worse, at a point where it would shut-down even before completing to load the windows\n\nNow Im writing from my phone and I let the pc just on, and it hasn't happened so far, but I need to do my stuff, and I dont think that the water cooler will solve this.\n\nSomeone has any idea of something I could do to understand better the problem so at least, get to solve it?\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone that tried to help, I now understand the problem and it is my GPU, if and when it gets load, it resets and shuts down the computer. PSU is working as intended as it was tested with an oscilloscope. \n\nI will try someone to look into it if its fixable, but its hard to get this kind of maintenance where I live, so I guess I'll have to get a new one."

So if I think Zynx is a suitable pick for support I customize it in that way, no need to open the \"show all heroes\" tab.\n\nSecond thing it does is remove cluttering, we still don't have that many heroes, but I would like to only see heroes I'm comfortable with, so no need to show me Riktor as a jungler, so I customize it so.\n\nPut this as an option on the hero's mastery page, something like:\n\n**Position**\n\n* \u2610 Standart  \\\\Default\n* \u2610 Jungle\n* \u2610 Support\n* \u2610 Carry\n* \u2610 Solo\n* \u2610 Mid\n\n\nI've seen someone explaining the reasoning behind \"why riktor is not between the supports\" as in, for newer players, he might too hard to pull off but more experienced players will know that he is a support and will pick him regardless. So this role customization could be locked behind a level just like deck building(is it still like that?).\n\nNothing changes, it's just a plus QoL for those who are willing to use it."

Newer toilets, though, added forced water to reduce the water level needed to initiate it. Thus, the new design has more water turbulence.\n\nIf we just go back to older designs, we'd have a lot less aerosolized poo-water, if any.",

My dad has the tiny black dot, too, in both ears.\n\nOther symptoms include the left ear drum getting stuck more than the right when I try to pop it, requiring more effort, and loud noises sometimes cause a bit of buzzing in the left ear. I have no idea how long this has been going on. Has to be many years, at least 5, but not my whole life. It's such a small problem to me that only curiosity drives me to do something about it.\n\nExtra question: Can I call up an ENT directly, or do I need a PCD to recommend it first?"

But I've always felt comfortable being a girl. I don't mind being perceived as one, and I feel no dysphoria. I'm quite happy in my own skin. So I'm a girl, but I want to be a boy too? It's not like I'd want to do any surgery I think... but also I want to be a boy. And when I do want to be a boy it's only occasional. A lot of times I'm completely happy being a girl and feel fine with it. I'm just really confused. I don't know if this counts for anything, but I do theater, and all of my dream roles have always been guys. I've always projected myself into both boy and girl characters, depending on the day. I know that clothes and interests don't define gender, but to add to it I've always been a girly-girl. I love skirts and dresses, and fashion and makeup interest me. Most of my friends are girls, and I rarely ever make friends with boys. What do you guys think this might be??

My type for guys is completely different from what it is with girls (and non binary!!), and although I like them without a preference my type for each still varies. Girls I've liked are often taller or more masculine, and more on the \"tough\" side. With guys its the complete opposite, where I find myself liking feminine or shy guys...\n\nIs it ok to have a completely different type for different genders and still be pan?

Since destined death was sealed off, and the elden ring shattered, the lands between have been stuck in a state of purgatory, waiting for the tarnished to bring a new change. One of the characters who intentionally gets in the tarnished's way is king Morgott, who under the guise of Margit, leads the night cavalry to take down the strongest tarnished warriors and protects the state of the world. As such, using destined death on Morgott, the one who tried to hold back change, is poetically fitting.\n\nAm I being stupid? Yes. Do I want to do it anyway? Yes. Pls help."

I\u2019m a fairly new Radiohead fan and I had heard about half of these songs before giving the whole album a listen but even the songs I didn\u2019t love at first listen grew on me a little. In conclusion, this is a good album that gets a lot more hate then it deserves."

Or am I seeing something that isn\u2019t there? Anyone know what Alan was like as a dad?\n\nEdit:\nSeems like the consensus is he deserves to charge what he wants, because most people are happy to just watch what floats and leaks to other platforms and if someone is a super fan or whatever then they can pay the $360 for the complete works. \n\nSeems like it could be problematic if he were to squash outside sharing of the material and force his own exclusivity of obtaining it, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be like that, and there is allowance of other use licenses etc. I just wish I could afford it tbh.\n\nEdit2: I\u2019m not searching for sources, although it\u2019s appreciated.

                "body": "So recently TikTok has basically forced me to enter my birthday as a requirements if I wanted to keep using it. \n\nI am a 28 year old woman, I only started using Tiktok back in 2021. \n\nI actually love using TikTok because I enjoy so much of the fairy core and cottage core lifestyle videos up there, memes, comedy, incredibly enriching and intelligence TikToks based on cultures from around the USA and elsewhere in the world, alt tok and goth tok, the world of people who were my peers in my late teens to twenties and mid twenties, animators, creatives, fellow neurodivergents, Queertok, learning about blm and black content creators and even more black history than I ever would have from my school system in spite of living in New York. Indigenous culture, social justice issues. Some of the very first videos that I got on the platform happened to be amazing five nights at Freddy's security bridge cosplays or cosplays a video game character its other shows and fandoms, and a lot of the time they carried a humorous and youthful streak, because shockers, it was often people younger than me or who were making content for younger people making the content. Which isn't to say that people my own age or older weren't involved as well, but I guess I saw a lot from that crowd. \nI felt so alive and enriched and happy and inspired and in awe, every single visit.\n\nBut after sharing my birthday, all of the content has had a markable shift.\n\nI haven't actually interacted a lot with people my own age because I'm an isolated person irl who finds it hard to connect with people in meatspace, but I've always had a good time being on the internet, save for a few instances specifically outside of TikTok. And just so you know, no I'm not a hikkikomori, I am a full grown adult woman who is employed and holds a Masters degree. \n\n\nBut now I realize that I feel like I've either been blacklisted because of being open about my age and trying to make my own Tiktoks, while simutaneaously seeing a lot of content that's now a bunch of millennials who speak petty things, engaging in some insanity like debating whose sexuality is \"valid\" or whose allowed to call themselves alt or goth. I almost never get fun animated content or memes on my FYP anymore, where people validated and supported each other's exploration of their self and what ever their interests are. I saw a post on a self proclaimed lesbian bashing people who call them \"bi lesbians\". And it's like, I didn't freaking ask to be shown content that basically sounds like bullying or looking down on others. Maybe shes younger than I am but the whole vibe just takes me back to parts of my formal years that I thought I distanced myself from from artificial drama that feels like it distracts from either actual issues going on in the world (like what's literally happening to trans people right now in the USA with certain bills) or just seeing anything that made me get a good dopamine/serotonin kick. I didn't come onto the app to witness the trashiest or boorish of unwanted hot takes.\n\nThis whole time, I felt at peace with myself and content in my own skin, but I'm being reminded of how I grew up being bullied, couldn't understand or couldn't care about divisive social politics as a young girl. I thought I genuinely developed and saw a better world. But now I realize its still full of people I find to be completely insufferable. And Im not suggesting that Gen Z is perfect, but I just literally can't stand other millenials after growing up surrounded by them and seeing they still haven't fucking changed in plenty of ways. \nAnd I realize that part of what made me an insufferable person myself was how I would always react to what I saw as irritating stuff, so it's like a vicious feedback loop, as I feel myself mentally regress back into an irritable teenage hipster who thought I was hot shit for acting mature (being quiet and just trying to doodle my OCs, making art projects while embracing early 2010s era meme culture and lolhumor in private). And again I'm really genuinely showing my hardest not to make fun of people who take their relationships seriously, I want to be respectful, But I don't know the f*** I can be with some of what I see on my FYP. \n\nLike, it sucks. I thought I found a place that finally felt like it made *sense* and I enjoyed myself everytime I was there only now I feel myself taking a deep breath because some jerk wants to justify harassing or doubting SA victims. I just want to have a good time and also learn things along the way, tick tock is the only form of social media that I feel I can enjoy to the fullest. It feels like I have to mourn a second death of my childhood.\n\nI don't know if I'm wrong or should feel bad about it, If I'm the only person who's experienced this, Or maybe that I'm supposed to suck it up and enjoy feeling like I'm doomed to being a crusty 30 year old."

Fast forwards to today, I managed to get recruited into addictions related social work, and this is my 4th week of training so far. I feel like I have a good idea of how to do some basics of the job, but I never assume full competency in anything, ever, because there are tons of stuff that gets lost in communication, things that I feel really ought to be submitted via memo (I have an awful memory at times) and everything feels like it's presented in the most extra way possible and makes me so nervous regarding using the system. It's not my first rodeo in a healthcare oriented setting but its been terrifying me. I have a three month probationary period. I've showed up late often since I commute 33 miles one way to show up (this was the only decent job I could get) and it's taken a while to get used to having to commute early to the city. \n\nI feel like an idiot a lot of the time. We don't have a formal way of having me test the system we use, and I'm constantly not super sure of myself, even though I think if someone just handed me a practice dummy with specific assignments to process them on a PC, I could get things down? I'm currently shadowing another SW'r here but I just follow along as best as I can observing how she communicates with clients so I know what the process looks like in action. \n\nThis day has me feeling more stupid than usual and it makes me think I'm not going to last here or even get fired soon once people catch on that I'm incredibly slow, they say that most social workers by now would be expected to just start by now (which terrifies me ,because I'm Liscenced, and I don't want to lose my Liscence if I screw up at my first real job. Meanwhile many of the other social workers are unlicenced)."

I've been also looking for an owner if it was likely an escape pet. \nNo luck, guessing it was genuinely in the wild in spite of being invasive. But they are so small and I wouldnt forgive myself if I just abandoned them to chance in my very busy suburban environment where it's regular to find animals killed on the road.\n\nMy brother and dad who I live with have been extremely discouraging towards me in getting a tank and have openly called me stupid, badmouthed me, said we don't even have an appropriate outlet or space for a tank. It doesn't help that I'n between jobs at the moment, and we are also having issues with the landlord who may try to evict us soon and that's scary. Maybe some of this is a vent but I feel scared for the little guy, I have no heater or filter, I just change out the water in their shallow basin everyday and place them in a cardboard box outside of the water so they can have a break.

                "body": "TLDR: You only need a permit for an amp, a table, or selling things. Some areas of the park are restricted (check these in 3.1 and the PDF I attached).\n\nI'm planning to go busking in Central Park NYC next month when I go back to college. I spent a long time trying to figure out whether or not I need a permit, looking at blogs and their official website. The first result on google was a blog that said something along the lines of \"you can buy a Special Event permit for $25 per month of performances.\" This is also the most common answer I found on this subreddit scrolling through old posts. I'm guessing the blog was where this rumor started.\n\nI also read that most people busk in CP without permits and never have problems, but I didn't want to get nervous every time a police car drove by, so I tried buying a Special Event Permit from their website. As I was filling out the form, I could only reserve an event for one day. I was trying to book it for a full month, as the internet had suggested.\n\nAnd so, I went to the fine print laws on their website. Here are the rules you need to know (I'll summarize them afterwards):\n\n1. No person in or on any property under the jurisdiction of the Department shall sell, offer for sale, hire, lease, or let anything whatsoever, including, but not limited to goods, services, or entertainment, or provide or offer to provide services, items, or entertainment in exchange for a donation (hereinafter \u201cvend\u201d), except under and within the terms of a permit, or except as otherwise provided by law. For the purposes of this entire section, persons who vend as defined herein may be referred to as \u201cvendor\u201d or \u201cvendors.\u201d\n2. Persons may vend expressive matter, as defined in section 1-02 of this title, on property under jurisdiction of the Department without a permit, but must comply with all applicable provisions of these rules. However, in the specific locations enumerated in paragraph (3) expressive matter vendors may only vend expressive matter at the specifically designated spots identified by the Commissioner in the accompanying maps and as marked by a Department decal, medallion, or other form of marking, on the specific location of the approved vending spot, unless they are only vending expressive matter without using a cart, display stand, or other device and without occupying a specific location for longer than necessary to conduct a transaction and are otherwise in compliance with Department rules. These spots shall be allocated upon a first come, first served basis except as otherwise provided by law and any expressive matter vendor may only vend expressive matter centered directly behind the Department decal, medallion, or other form of marking. Only one expressive matter vendor is authorized to vend directly behind the Department decal, medallion, or other form of marking. If multiple expressive matter vendors attempt to vend expressive matter at any one Department decal, medallion, or other form of marking and it cannot be determined which expressive matter vendor arrived first, then all such expressive matter vendors at such spot will be in violation of this section and may be directed to leave the area of that Department decal, medallion, or other form of marking immediately. Any such expressive matter vendor failing to leave the area of the Department decal, medallion, or other form of marking immediately upon direction will be in violation of these rules. Expressive matter vendors can only occupy the designated spots for the purpose of vending expressive matter and only during posted times, which will be consistent with the hours of operation for the park where such designated spots are located in or adjacent to. The designated spots may deviate from the restrictions enumerated in subparagraphs (i), (iv), (v), or (vi) of paragraph 5, if such spots are determined to be appropriate by the Commissioner given the specific features of the park.\n3. Expressive matter vendors may not vend in the following general areas unless they vend at the specifically designated spots for such vending on the accompanying maps and in compliance with all other applicable Department rules:\n   1. Central Park at the following locations: (A) the perimeter of the park between East 85th Street and East 60th Street, including all sidewalks and plazas (B) the perimeter of the park between West 86th Street and West 60th Street, including all sidewalks and plazas (C) all of Central Park South, including all sidewalks and plazas (D) Wien Walk and Wallach Walk, (E) pedestrian pathways parallel to East Drive between Grand Army Plaza and the Center Drive, (F) Grand Army Plaza, (G) Pulitzer Plaza, and (H) Columbus Circle.\n\nSource:  [\u00a71-05 Regulated Uses : NYC Parks (nycgovparks.org)](https://www.nycgovparks.org/rules/section-1-05) \n\nOr in comprehensible English:\n\n1. If your busking breaks any of the following rules, you need a permit.\n2. You can busk anywhere without a permit other than the locations listed above (3.1). In those locations, you can only busk on specific spots marked by medallions on a first come, first serve basis. You'll only get into trouble if you refuse to leave a location after you're asked to leave. You can find the maps of the locations with medallions starting on page 4 of [this PDF](http://www.nycgovparks.org/pagefiles/57/expressive-matter-faq.pdf)\n\nOther details from the rest of the page:\n\n1. You can only busk from 8 am to 10 pm (idk why you would want to busk at night anyways)\n2. You can't be too close to a residential structure\n3. You can't block pedestrian traffic or play anything disturbing\n4. You do need a permit if you set up a table or sell anything\n5. You do need a permit for an amp of any kind which is something ridiculous like $45 a day\n\nJust felt like putting all this out there in case anyone is as confused as I was. Also, in case I got anything wrong, please correct me. I'll see how it goes in in a few weeks--hopefully New Yorkers like my viola playing."

If it's worth it to go for a master's even (I would either get one in sport management, marketing, or communications which is why I think IMC would be perfect for me)?

I'm nine years self taught on the piano and I've gotten absolutely nowhere - granted, I haven't been the most disciplined as i mainly played songs that I enjoyed playing (hypergixations - I have Autism and ADHD) which were typically pop or game music, and my area is poor so only offered BTEC onstead of A Level music which focussed on pop songs.\n\nAnyway, I've come to the realisation that I'm literally awful at the piano and my mental health has taken a HUGE hit because of this. I'm seeing a counsellor but I just can't stand not being able to perform music at my university anymore when music was such a big passion to me. Now I'm banned from jazz bands, soloist concerts, orchestras and even just the music practice room because it's only for people who can play at a grade 8 level - I can barely get through Reverie.\n\nI'm just begging for any advice on how I can improve quickly, because honestly if I cannot engage with my passion for my whole time at university I might actually not make it through.\n\nFor reference, I typically play at about grade 5 level (what some of you would call intermediate and some would call beginner) but I'm just an absolute idiot who can't grasp classical music at all. My boyfriend is an incredible pianist and just keeps telling me 'relax your hands, read the music one bar a head' and I'm trying to do those things but I just keep losing my place and it's getting to the point where I cry every time I try to play.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated! Please help a girl out so she doesn't have to give up on music forever.\n\nP.S. a teacher is absolutely not an option, I can't afford to heat my home at the minute let alone afford music lessons."

Music is THE most important thing in the world to me and the fact that I'm so bad at it while all my friends are so good is heartbreaking. I've never been able to afford lessons and come from a poor background, but have tried teaching myself absolutely everything from sight reading to technique to theory, and I still can't play anything above ABRSM grade one. Recently, it's absolutely crushed my mood, and I would do anything in the world to be able to play something that isn't made for kids. Even the pieces I play that aren't made for kids (River Flows in You, Nuvole Bianche, alongside loads of non-classical pieces) always say like 'suitable for 7-8 year olds' and its just so soul destroying when I've been trying so hard for so long.\n\nI also can't cook. This isn't from lack of trying. I've tried so many experiments and followed so many YouTube tutorials and recipes but I just can't make anything better than a 11 year old food tech student could.\n\nI can't drive, and this one is soul destroying. I come from a poor, rural town and EVERYONE can drive other than me. I feel so childish and stupid about it. I've had lessons and practiced with my parents, but every time I get in the car for the exam I fail on something easy like a 5 lane roundabout or something. One time I even failed for panicking because my examiner called me \"little girl\" and it just killed me on the inside.\n\nI would do anything at all to not be seen like a child. I'm 5ft tall with small breasts and am very thin, and can't gain weight due to hyperthyroidism. Everywhere I go I'm treated like a child and I just hate it. When I had a job I had like 5 customers a week ask if I was old enough to work there, or ask if I was in high school yet.\n\nIt's getting hard for me to get out of bed in the morning knowing that I'll never be taken as seriously as everyone else. It hurts so much that I am so childish in looks and have no talents above a child's level. I don't know what to do and it's destroying me on the inside."

I recognise my privilege in many areas of life and know that people have it far worse off than me, this is just a bit of a rant because I really feel completely worthless sometimes.\n\nI attend the most prestigious university in my country. Everyone there is gifted in ways I cannot even fathom, and they\u2019ve had tutoring and lessons in music and maths and computers and ballet and all manner of things I can\u2019t even begin to form a fully comprehensive list of. Every single one of them is ridiculously gifted both in their subject and outside of it, with most getting 1sts (the top degree grade) in exams and high proficiencies in their in instruments and hobbies. It\u2019s incredible being surrounded by them and they\u2019re some of my best friends.\n\nBut I\u2019m completely worthless in comparison. I\u2019m a poor girl from a small rural town who\u2019s there on a scholarship and I just can\u2019t do anything at all. I\u2019m terrible at everything. I feel like the most stupid person in the world. I\u2019m only getting a 2:1 in my degree, I can\u2019t drive, I know nothing about philosophy and I don\u2019t do sport, and music is the most important thing in the WORLD to me and I self taught myself lots of instruments growing up but since I wasn\u2019t able to have lessons my proficiency is so bad that\u2019s it\u2019s just humiliating to even play in public. I know that nobody takes me seriously, and I don\u2019t get invited to any music events except for when I\u2019m a tag along of my boyfriend (who gets 1sts in his degree too and is an incredible musician).\n\nMy education was absolutely appalling, I was only allowed to take 8 exams and a vocational course whereas most people here have 12 exams. They had no professional teaching in any extracurricular; no qualified music, sport or philosophy teachers who could help me get vocational qualifications. In fact, they essentially had no normal teachers either - 16 year old me ended up teaching high school classes as an \u2018assistant\u2019 to supply teachers who didn\u2019t know the subjects they were teaching.\n\nSo, realistically, I know that the fact I managed to get into my university it\u2019s no teachers, no support, and having to work to earn money alongside teaching classes and teaching myself the content I didn\u2019t learn in school, means that I am not an idiot. But I just feel so worthless. I just cocked up two really important exams because I just wasn\u2019t smart enough and I can\u2019t play any instruments any more for respite. I can\u2019t join any societies that do music because I just get singled out when I can\u2019t read the music fast enough or play well enough, I can\u2019t carry on with theatre because I don\u2019t have the qualifications, and I am poor so have no money at all to pay for lessons in anything.\n\nSometimes, I feel like the most stupid person in the world. I feel useless, and humiliated to be alive. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019ve had therapy and can\u2019t have any more because I can\u2019t afford it, and I also can\u2019t afford to drop out of uni because too much money has been wasted and I have no qualifications.\n\nAnd god, I wish I could just pass my goddamn driving test so I\u2019d be treated like an adult (f19, small, treated like a child).\n\nTLDR: everyone around me is insanely gifted and I\u2019m an idiot in comparison.

I have gone from a small town to the most prestigious university in my country, and when I was back home I was never able to engage with things my friends were good at (video games, make up etc) because I wasn't good enough at them and now I'm here, I can't engage with things with my new friends (music, photography, ballet, writing, philosophy) either. \n\nIt's just so frustrating. I've been starting to feel really low about it. I have ADHD, and consequently jumped between a loooot of hobbies as a kid because I got bored doing just one thing. The most important thing in my life has always been music, and it's gotten me through a lot. However, I'm not good enough at music to engage with it here - I never had lessons at the piano and guitar and am self-taught, so I can't join any bands or societies because I'm not good enough to get in. I do play with my boyfriend sometimes; he's the most incredible piano player I've ever met (like, seriously - that's not a pedestal thing) and as much as I love it, I struggle to keep up and I know sometimes he simplifies things for me when we duet. He is super supportive and kind and makes me feel really good about myself though. I've also been trying to learn a videogame so I can play with him, but I'm super bad at that too, and usually drag the team down. Even though they're super supportive and say they don't mind, I'd like to contribute more! My friends all have talents that they're seen and recognised for, such as ballet, philosophy, article writing, crochet and other things. And they're all super talented at these things too! I'm super, super proud of them and this isn't a jealousy thing, I just kind of wish I had something too so that I didn't feel like I was falling behind. I'm not getting top grades in my degree like others either, but I'm trying my best and that's what counts!\n\nI know that I'm likely just setting the bar way too high for myself, but I just feel so mediocre at everything. Sometimes I try to think of what hobbies I have that I could engage in with my friends and boyfriends, but the truth is I like the same things as them, I'm just a lot worse at them: I like playing music, but I can only play simple things; I like dance, but I can only do freestyle and rock and roll; I like art, but my art is not quite good enough to be considered a 'talent'.\n\nThis isn't like a huge 'I hate myself' sort of rant. I know that I am trying my best. However, sometimes I just get down because I'm the only person without a 'thing' that can be attributed to them, and consequently struggle to do things with others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: All of my friends both at home and uni have talents but I don't have anything I'm particularly good at. I'm disappointingly mediocre at most things."

However, I'm starting to feel really stupid because all of my friends are getting 1sts in their subjects (STEM and humanities, the whole mix) and I can only get a 2:1. I've tried so many different things, from maximising study time (I did 10hrs a day for a while and fainted and we had to call paramedics) to changing study methods but nothing seems to be working. It's really taking a toll on my self esteem because it just makes me feel like I don't deserve to be at my uni nor with my friends, and I feel like I will never live up to them. They all have talents outside of their degrees too (piano, photography, writing etc) but I just don't have time to get good at anything because I have to spend all of my time working.\n\nJust a general overview of some things about me:\n\n* I usually do 6-8hrs of work depending on the day.\n* I have quite serious ADHD but can't get medication due to a 3 year delay in the diagnostic system (neither I nor my uni can fund it privately).\n* I come from a very poor background compared to all of my friends.\n* I study loads of different modules for law but I'm aiming at focussing on Criminal Law (crim bar UK)\n* My average score is a 62 but I'm better at problems than essays (avg 67 v avg 62)\n* I get ill (sickness and nausea) if I wake up before 9 in the mornings and have done ever since I was a child (I'm definitely not pregnant! It's always been like this).\n\nDo you have any advice for how someone like me could improve my grade? I'm super sorry if this subject is a bit niche but I really needed somewhere to turn!"

I\u2019ve tried dedicating myself to some things to improve at them, like art or the piano, but I\u2019m so far behind everyone else that I know people judge me when they see me practicing because I\u2019m at the level they were at when they were children.\n\nWhen I was a kid I was quite poor (not that I realised that before going to uni) so didn\u2019t have access to lessons/communities for a lot of my hobbies, and I didn\u2019t have the resources to play video games, download music software, or get Netflix/streaming services. However, because most people in my town were in the same position, I was looked at as quite talented for being able to teach myself my hobbies to a reasonable proficiency (I taught myself up to about Grade 4 piano with no resources, about an A level in art and a few video games I could get versions of that would work on my phone).\n\nI always loved trying new things, which suited me quite well because I have ADHD which made it hard to stick to only one thing for a long time.\n\nHowever now at Uni, every single person is so gifted, have hobbies they\u2019ve been improving at since they were children, and can do all manner of things I never even knew existed. As such, I\u2019m kind of way too embarrassed to engage in any of my hobbies around other people because I\u2019m just so much worse in comparison. It hurts me sometimes when they call me a beginner or say I\u2019m at a child\u2019s level because I\u2019m not a child at all, I\u2019m just as much as a respectable adult as them who has been doing the same skill for just as long, just haven\u2019t progressed as much.\n\nAs such, I have absolutely no hobbies anymore. I can\u2019t do things I enjoy to ease the stress of my degree and it\u2019s becoming so hard for me to to maintain my mental health because I have no stress outlets at all. I\u2019ve recently tried to get better at the piano and I\u2019m slowly improving but I\u2019m still only playing easy intermediate pieces and it hurts to know I\u2019ll have to give up practicing when I get back to uni or people will look down on me, so I\u2019ll go straight back to square one. I\u2019ve also tried picking up a new pc game now I have a new laptop so I can play with my friends, but I\u2019m still learning it and when my friends speak condescendingly to me because I\u2019m not as advanced as them it just kind of breaks my heart.\n\nDoes anybody have any advice of how I can work around this? I\u2019m in desperate need of a stress outlet and I don\u2019t know what to do. And I know people will just say practice more hours but my university has me working for ten hours a day and I really need to at and sleep enough because the last time I didn\u2019t I fainted.\n\nAny advice at all would be appreciated, thank you!\n\n(Summary, too bad at everything to keep up with the skills of people at my university and too embarrassed to engage in hobbies because of this. how can i improve at something on a strict time schedule?)"

                "body": "This is not a highly developed theory, I just wanted to see what you guys thought of it. Though it may seem unlikely, please consider it:\n\nThe majority of the Fatui harbingers seemed to meet in Sumeru Academia, where Lisa was the most proficient student. Pierro and Dottore were extremely interested in making a powerful, god-like human (I\u2019m assuming something similar to making their own Scaramouche) so would most likely have needed the highest level of intelligence for this, surely. Could they possibly have enlisted Lisa?\n\nThey later enlisted other members to become Harbingers, such as Signora, Pulcinella and Pantalone, to join their organisation. I am here assuming that the Fatui Members\u2019 numbers (aside from Pierro, are dedicated to power, not time of enlistment, as suggested when Yae Miko says that Scaramouche is the 6th, and thus more powerful than Signora, implying that his power relates to his number).\n\nWhile this organisation was still one that involved academia, would it not be probable that Lisa was a part of it? Plus, she has an obsession with understanding how visions control the elements - while played off as curiosity, could this not be linked to delusions? Specifically, her voice line where she says she would like to experiment on how the traveller uses elements without a vision makes me suspicious of this - especially since she said \u2018experiment\u2019, not \u2018research\u2019, and Lisa is presented to be an academic, not a scientist.\n\nLater, it is made apparent that the Fatui did indeed gain a god-like superhuman, Scaramouche, Number 6, a \u2018divine creation\u2019 that they could then make their own.\n\nPierro also is called the Jester, and in Italian theatre, Pierrot is a sad clown who falls in love with someone who doesn\u2019t love him. Could this imply that Pierro fell in love with the Tsaritsa, hence why the harbingers began working for her?\n\nThe question that I ponder then is, if Lisa WAS involved in the Fatui, did she leave once they had achieved their goal of creating a god like human and started enlisting combat-orientated members such as Childe, or did she remain a harbinger, only undercover as a knight of Favonius, further explaining why, in her own words, it would be \u2018dangerous\u2019 for her to take up a captain\u2019s role?\n\nAgain, this is all just speculation. It just seems remarkably suspicious to me that Lisa is the only major character thus far who attended sumeru academia who is, apparently, not a harbinger. The fact that the organisation started in the academy and likely searched for intelligent members suggests that she could be involved.\n\nP.S. sorry for weird grammar and formatting, I\u2019m typing on mobile and my autocorrect is weird.\n\nUPDATE: Also, so many characters make such a distinctive point on commenting on how dangerously powerful she is, could this be linked to the Harbingers' power requirements and training techniques?"

Maybe I should make song writing my major? I am going to Belmont University in Nashville, it\u2019s a pretty good school from my understanding, Honestly I don\u2019t know if I want to work in the industry if I don\u2019t get to perform.

I\u2019m not ugly by any means, but I also don\u2019t think I\u2019m so hot that they would just literally throw me a record contract at me if that\u2019s something you think it really takes. I am just not sure I\u2019m interested in working in the music business unless it\u2019s a really creative position and it\u2019s not just me working in A&R or something like that. Maybe I should just settle for building myself up locally again? I wouldn\u2019t be able to live in my parents home while I go to university. I did last semester from home because of COVID and they told me I should be able to do that again this semester. I have been scared to really put myself out there as you said. But, maybe being an artist with a very small following and a day job wouldn\u2019t be bad, I don\u2019t know. I know I need to grow up, and I don\u2019t want to waste a good opportunity but even when I move there next semester I won\u2019t have enough money to even cover dorms, unless I get some really good scholarships between now and then, I will be in debtors prison basically by the end of all of this. Belmont is good, so if it s worth it it\u2019s worth it, but maybe I could just get into passive streams of income or work up to finding a job I like in nature and also write. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve definitely been hiding that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019ve been embarrassed to come out and try I guess.",

The manga really only focuses on the protagonist (Boruto) and the deuteragonist (Kawaki).\n\nAll other characters get neglected, and really while they could give Sarada a power up, for some reason they are choosing to sideline everyone who's not Boruto or Kawaki.",

I personally like her character for what she is, not what I think she should or could become. \n\nShe's a 12 year old girl who was shy and timid until Boruto helped her come out of her shell, and she feels great appreciation for him because of that. Even moreso after learning that he had issues with his dad just like her with her dad.\n\nShe has been working hard towards that goal, she doesn't have any Otsutsuki karma power ups and she's just trying her hardest as a kid to keep up with her teammates who are literally stronger than the adult leaders of her village.\n\n>i don't feel she did anything wrong or humiliating this chapter\n\nI \ud83d\udcaf agree! She's acting how her character has always acted. She's always been overly sensitive about Boruto getting hurt, and she suddenly learns he died and no one told her about it?! She's frustrated that she as a future Hokage is powerless and can't protect her teammate. What can she do? She has 3 tomoe and can do chidori. How is she supposed to defend Boruto when she's not only always kept in the dark about things so she doesn't even know that Kawaki is that much stronger now? I mean as readers we know that Kawaki has Karma but if I recall correctly, Sarada was never informed he regained it back. Only that Code had injured Boruto and that's how he got the scar in his chest.",

Because they're family. Why save them over strangers? Because they are family. Most people won't mourn a stranger's death, at most, they can empathize and feel sadness for them. Most people will mourn their pet's death. They will cry for them. They will have them buried or cremated. They will be emotionally shaken because they have just lost a part of their family.\n\nAgain you probably won't understand why people treat them or think of pets as family, and you're not obligated to understand.

                "body": "TLDR at end.\n\nHell is not a real place where people are tormented forever. That belief is not biblical or supported by the bible. The bible does not mention an afterlife, in fact in Ecclesiastes 9:5,6,10 says \"For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at all, nor do they have any more reward, because all memory of them is forgotten.  6\u00a0Also, their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished, and they no longer have any share in what is done under the sun. 10. Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might, for there is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in the Grave, where you are going.\n\nHell is simply the Sheol or the common grave. It doesn't matter whether you are good or evil, we all end up dead, in hell/Sheol. https://www.britannica.com/science/death/Mesopotamia#ref385082\n\nGod permits all people whether good or bad to be able to live their lives. This is said in Mathew 5:44,45 \"44 However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you,  45\u00a0so that you may prove yourselves sons of your Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise on both the wicked and the good and makes it rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous\"\n\nGod let's all this happen because he is simply not in control of the world. 1 John 5:19 says that \"We know that we originate with God, but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.\" His authority to govern was challenged by Satan who became prideful and wanted humans to worship him as well. It is why Satan turned himself into a snake and deceived Adam and Eve into eaten the prohibited fruit, which marked human's obedience and loyalty was not to God. \n\nGod had the power to kill Adam and Eve immediately. He could have created new humans to populate the Earth. But he wanted to show that there would be people willing to serve him out of their own free will. Job for example, was one human who demonstrated that he is faithful to God whether he had a good or horrible life.\n\nTherefore on that day that Adam and Eve disobeyed his command, God gave a promise that there would come a man born to mankind that would be a ransom to allow humans to receive forgiveness of their sin. Jesus' death was necessary so that people can live in Earth forever in a perfect world. This will happen when God commands the destruction of Satan and his former sociopolitical religious world as mentioned in Revelation 17, 18. The beast described is a political institution and the prostitute who stands on many waters is false religion. Both will be destroyed.\n\nSo to recap, TLDR. God does not punish anyone with eternal torment. The ultimate punishment is simple nonexistence in death. God permits life to continue as it has on earth but he does not interfere with the current world's affairs until his appointed time comes and that is very near but yet to come. When that day comes, he will allow the destruction of the current world (not the physical planet but rather the governments and religious institutions that currently exist). \n\nThen he will allow anyone who is faithful to him to live forever in a planet with no more disease, hunger, or death, so that humans can once again live as he planned in Genesis 1:27-30\n\n \"27 And God went on to create the man in his image, in God\u2019s image he created him; male and female he created them.  28\u00a0Further, God blessed them, and God said to them: \u201cBe fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving on the earth.\u201d 29\u00a0Then God said: \u201cHere I have given to you every seed-bearing plant that is on the entire earth and every tree with seed-bearing fruit. Let them serve as food for you.  30\u00a0And to every wild animal of the earth and to every flying creature of the heavens and to everything moving on the earth in which there is life, I have given all green vegetation for food.\u201d And it was so.\"\n\nMany teachings about hell, the afterlife, that God wants angels in heaven so he allows kids to be killed etc, are all teachings that are not only biblical but also soil his name. They are taught by false religion which he will destroy for causing so much suffering on earth. His purpose for humanity has always been to live forever in a beautiful planet while they have fun, take care of the planet and the animals, and just enjoy themselves. It has not changed and it will be fulfilled.\n\nSo yeah that's actually what the Bible teaches."

Seduced by the revolutionary idea of Protocol Owned Liquidity i immediately wanted to participate & earn my share of money. Instead of going with OHM i had the good idea of looking for forks; i found Wonderland quite early & stacked a fair amount of money (felt confident bcs of Daniel & Wonderland being the most popular fork of OHM).\n\nBut i must confess that i do not fully understand the workings of the system; the numerous posts on this sub made me realize that it's not that simple & that the monstrous gainz promised by the APY are but a mirage.\n\nIf i understand correctly buying and stacking my $Time is part of the *optimal strategy*\u2122, the system thanks me for participating and rewards me with rebases (In %Memo) every 8 hour, proportionally to my stacked amount & the APY%. $Memo being equal to $Time.\n\nThe rewards (every 8 hours) are minted by the protocol & distributed proportionally to every stackers. Logically, the increase in supply due to rebases makes the $Time inflationary & if the treasury, from which the $Time are minted, does not increase in size & if the total supply is not caped, which i think is not \\[?\\], $Time loses it's value over time. Do i get this correctly ?\n\nFollowing this line of thinking, if the Treasury stay stagnant, the price of $Time doesn't move & the protocol keep minting new $Time, then my balance will increase due to rabases but the value of my stacked $Time will not move; Owning 1/100 of the supply is same as owning 100/10000 of the supply. (If the rebases aren't sufficient to then my stacked amount will lose value (is this possible?)).\n\nTherefore, if i get it right, the only way for me to get richer is if the $Time token increase in value or the treasury increase in size. It's ultimately a market cap game. Correct me if i am wrong.\n\nSo the real question is how the protocol earns money ? Ofcrs minting plays an important role but the protocol cannot simply rely on this bonding mechanism, for it's Ponzi-like mechanisms are evident; good if you are early but unsustainable in a long-term. \n\nThe 2nd way the treasury can grow in size it's through VC investing. The protocol provide it's liquidity (the treasury) & earn revenues from the yields, that further grows the treasury & benefits every stacker. For lack of a better word, Wonderland is an decentralized *hedge fund* .. \n\nIf the majority of growth are generated through treasury yields or others VC investments, then the system is far from being a Ponzi scheme. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf i got it right (correct me if i am not), then the %amount i own out of the total supply of $Time never changes; when rebases happens, my balance grows but the total supply grows too, everything proportional, the value of my balance doesn't increase.\n\n**So, as an** ***Intelligent Investor\u2122,*** **i solely need to pay attention at the price of $Time and the growth of the treasury ..?**\n\nAlso, the yields from treasury are directly distributed to stackers ? The protocol buys $Time, driving the price up ?"

                "body": "Edit: Title should read: \"I (30m) need space. She (28f) needs attention.\" \n\nSo my girlfriend of 8 months gets extremely bad separation anxiety to the point where she has panic attacks when I'm not around. She had a horror story of a childhood and an abusive, distant ex she was married to for a long time. I tend to be someone who can easily feel smothered or overwhelmed if I don't have a lot of free personal time. \n\nI feel like I'm redlining to try and keep her happy (which I know isn't healthy) but it feels like it doesn't register to her. And sometimes she gets extremely distant or passive aggressive when I'm about to leave which hurts me deeply. I've expressed this and she's apologized saying she gets hit with a lot of emotions at once and \"it's easier to be distant than to give a sad goodbye.\" \n\nOne of those times happened earlier this week and it cut me deeply as all of the emotions I've bottled up kind of hit me at once. She was thankfully understanding that I needed space then. I was quietly spiraling and questioning everything, until we talked it over a bit on the phone and I felt like I got a lot off my chest. We had dinner plans for last night and had a really great time, until we were sitting alone in silence and she brought it up again, and added that she felt like the relationship \"was doomed\" because \"we want different things.\" She later reiterated her need for a lot of time and attention from me and how much pain she's in because she doesn't get it to the extent that she needs. And at some point she mentioned the dating pool being poor as she gets older (not the first time). Then she got noticeably sad and started playing sad music videos and we cried together mostly in silence for like an hour it felt like (alcohol was involved for what it's worth)\n\nThe spiral continued, and I got kind of emotional and defeatist. I assumed the next words she said would be the breakup because I didn't know what else those messages could possibly mean. So I basically admitted that I don't think I can give her love in the way she needs it and she said she just wants a life together and \"she isn't asking for much, just time and attention.\"\n\nShe said it was earth shattering to hear that. Apparently breakup wasn't on her mind at all. She went out to her car to have a smoke and asked to be alone (normally I'd join her). She came back and crawled into my bed. The conversation was kind of the same until she said \"I'm sorry. I made a plan for our lives and didn't consult you about it. Apparently it's a thing all girls do, all of my friends do it.\"\n\n Then after a bit it led back to her separation anxiety and I said (arguably too bluntly) \"If you genuinely can't be away from me then that's not healthy and it's some trauma thing you need to work on.\" In the middle of saying I'd be supportive, she yelled she's \"sick of having her trauma thrown in her face\" then threw my hand off her and rolled over. I apologized for the wording but insisted I wouldn't bring it up if it wasn't important and nothing else was said. She left this morning to go to work and I'm currently waiting for her to call me and I have no idea what to say.\n\nLike I know there's the common line of \"don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm\" and I understand that now more than ever. What can I do?"
