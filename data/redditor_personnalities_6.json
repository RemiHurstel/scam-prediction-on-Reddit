Our garden is a \"working garden\", we grow vegetables and herbs and one of the things I want to do is attract bees and other pollinators. We moved here last year and the garden was just a flat stretch of turf with shitty soil. We've made a lot of headway with it and are now in the process of converting this corner. My question is \n\n- do I need to remove the turf first, or for a meadow style area do I just plant some seeds among the grass and let it self seed etc? I've seen some people say one and some the other. What's making me think I should remove the turf is the soil quality here is shite. I had to remove tons of soil from my vegetable beds and replace it with top soil and dig in llama beans due to it all being clay and little else. So I'm tempted to dig the turf and nourish the ground before planting. However if I don't need to, then I don't want to waste my time. Any tips appreciated.\n\nI also plan to introduce yellow rattle plug plants regardless as a method to control the grass."

                "body": "I've tagged it as spoilers just in case. I have zero knowledge about leaks, this is purely my own interpretation based on a reading. Originally I posted this in the leaks thread but a few people asked me to post it by itself so here it is!\n\nSo as I promised [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/mkdkiy/new_chapter_spoilers_leaks_discussion_chapter_139/gtgnxvl?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) I've done a tarot reading for AoT. I've done a past, present and future which is a pretty standard reading. I'll be doing individual characters later. This is purely speculative and all I can read is what I see, but thought it would be fun while we have no leaks. \n\nHere are the cards I pulled. The deck is the Bohemian Gothic by Baba Studios, its out of print now sadly but its very beautiful. They go for a few hundred bucks online sometimes, if you like tarot and gothic stuff and have the cash, I would recommend it. Anyway!\n\nhttps://ibb.co/JzLRz9X\n\nSorry for it being tilted. I forgot to flip it before I uploaded it lmao.\n\nAnyway, a look at the first two cards. We've got the six of cups and the seven of wands in the past position. This is about the build up of the story so far and it fits surprisingly well. In the first image, we see two children, a boy and a girl, collecting flowers. Behind them is a walled fortress, and the sky is stormy. This card is often used to indicate nostalgia and memories of childhood, innocence and indulging in simple pleasures. However there are also darker meanings to every card and this can also indicate a traumatic or disturbed childhood, or a darkness behind an innocent facade. \n\nThe second card is the seven of wands. Here it depicts a horned monster batting away several sticks from his window. Wands are associated with the element of fire and are subsequently cards of willpower, passion and determination. Typically interpreted as the will to fight, getting a buzz from wining a battle, but also perhaps quick to start fights that aren't necessary and arrogant behaviour.\n\nIf we read these together as a narrative, we see children inside a fortress, gathering materials. There is an innocence around the children but the clouds and darkness in the distance suggest perhaps something unpleasant is looming. This then changes to someone with the determination to win and who takes pride in his victories, but perhaps may be a bit trigger happy. What struck me most about this was how the six of cups here reminded me a lot of the initial scenes of Eren and Mikasa collecting firewood and playing inside the walled city of Shiganshina. I think both these cards indicate Erens childhood fairly well. It was somewhat peaceful and idyllic but behind that facade he always felt trapped and penned in, literally indicated by the walls we can see behind, and the looming darkness approaching represents the attack on Shiganshina, which is what transforms the first card to the second, and gives him the drive and determination that we see become an integral part of his character.\n\nNow, if we look at the second two cards, we've got The High Priestess and The Magician. This is really interesting because these are Major Arcana cards, which indicate more significant events. The High Priestess usually refers to intuition, divination, and is the gatekeeper of secret knowledge. She sits between two pillars, guarding the gateway to another world. She is magic and mystery. The Magician speaks of manifestation. On his altar he has a representation of every element and the confidence in himself to manifest his desires. He wears a determined expression and the full moon behind him highlights his intuitive nature. He often indicates a controlling of natural forces, but the danger here is being seduced by the power or dealing with darker forces. Putting both of these meanings together, we have secret knowledge leading to a controlling of nature, with possible immoral implications. Again, I think its fairly clear that this refers to The Attack Titans power of future memories and his use of the founder to literally reshape the world, for better or worse. That is where we currently are in the story.\n\nNow, the last two cards. Again, they're both Major Arcana. This time, we've got The Hermit and Justice. Now, this is purely speculative on my part. All I can do is interpret what I see. I don't have anything to reference against for this part, so - no hate if I either get something wrong or say something you don't like lol. \n\nSo firstly, let's talk about The Hermit! This is a person who seeks truth and enlightenment, but one who may also be isolated or exiled from society, either by himself or by others. But before we delve into traditional meanings, let's take a look at the imagery. The first thing that stood out to me was the lamp. Of all the cards that could've come up for the future, the one with the lamp appears...now you all know (if you've seen my personal opinion posts) that I subscribe to Skyclads theory of the benevolent devil regarding Eren. Its interesting that similar imagery would appear here, at least to me. Reading this in a chronological fashion from the last two cards, in this spread it looks to me like The Magician who manifested his desires previously is now alone. The full moon is behind The Hermit much like The Magician, this to me indicates they're the same person in this reading. Behind The Hermit, trees flourish. But The Hermit himself looks weary, as if the light he is carrying is heavy and he wishes to rest. Its as if he himself can take no pleasure in the beautiful landscapes behind him, as he seems burdened by what is in his hands. The second and last card is also really interesting here - Justice. We see a judge, holding a red book and a candle in his hand, and another figure further behind him. Justice at its best can mean getting what you deserve, for better or worse, but at its worst, can indicate vengeance disguised as justice, one person acting as judge, jury and executioner or a cruel judgement. I am going to be honest and say I find this hard to interpret in the context here, because we all have very different opinions on what justice would look like in AoT at this point. Reading the two cards together, I would say its someone who's got what they wanted, but at a significant cost to themselves, in that they have very little inner peace and are stuck carrying a burden they long to put down. \n\nSo what does this indicate? Cautiously I'd see AnR but I don't want to commit to that as I will disappoint myself and everyone else if its wrong \ud83d\ude05 It could also indicate Eren trapped in paths, forever wandering, alone, never able to live in the beautiful world he has created for everyone else.\n\nSo, thats my interpretation! Any questions, ask away! I'll do specific character readings, if you want to request someone specific ask me. I'll obviously do our edgy boi, but feel free to request whatever you want. Also if you want a personal reading or whatever, I'm down to do that tonight. It took me about an hour to do this though so please be patient.\n\nHope this is interesting to some of you.\n\nEdited: so now we have the ending. I guess the Hermit was a literal meaning in Eren being alone, feeling that he couldn't be with Mikasa and the secret pr hidden knowledge he had referred to the titans ability to change both the last and the future."

I don't want a bright green, i want a dark green.\n\n2) how do I get it to blend into the black? I've read that i need to backcomb my hair near where I want the join to be but I'm still a bit confused.\n\nHere's a photo of the length and colour of my hair compared to the kind of effect I want.

I'm talking stacking items to make steps up to the top shelf, vaulting over toddler gates, using bookcases as a ladder. I've had to remove the bottom shelves in all my bookcases for this reason. Her bedroom has two gates stacked on top of each other otherwise she just escapes.\n\nIts constant. As soon as I remove her, she goes back to it. And she will trash whatever she finds. Push over ornaments, rip pages out of books. As soon as I remove her, she laughs and goes straight back to it. Or goes and climbs on something else. I can't take my eyes off her for a second, I can't get a drink or use the loo or anything like that. If I do she will create absolute pandemonium in that 30 second break by climbing and wrecking things.\n\nIts all day long. She will try to use the door handles to hang off, she's attempted to climb flat walls, she's used the radiators as a stepping stone...I've tried telling her no, I've tried talking to her, I've tried punishment, everything. She doesn't care. She just does it again.\n\nMy elder son has ADHD (as do I) and he wasn't this bad, although he was a pain with it for a while, which makes me query something similar with her. As well as the climbing she jumps, runs, throws herself off chairs, and generally isn't interested in \"playing\" or toys so much as charging around full steam. I take her out to the park and to the woodlands often and she climbs trees, so its not like she gets no output for this need.\n\nWhat can I do? Shes two but was born severely prematurely if that matters. I'm spending literally all day chasing her. Short of giving her a crash helmet and selling all my furniture on eBay I'm out of ideas.\n\nIs there anything I can do at all? I'm starting to get really fed up of it.\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much, I had never heard of a Pikler Triangle. Husband and I have looked at it and it looks perfect for her, we will be getting one ASAP.\n\nEDIT: Our triangle arrived yesterday and she loves it! Keeps going up and down it, jumping on and off and she hasn't touched the bookshelves or other furniture besides the couch since. We got one that is modular and can be linked to other triangles and climbing equipment, and we are going to get another one with a linking ladder as her brothers also like it. This is the best toy we've ever bought, I hadn't even heard of it until this thread. Thanks everyone."

The energy types (Generator, Manifesting Generator, and Manifestor) have black text on a colored background, while the non-energy types (Projector, Reflector) have white text on a colored background. The colors are as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Generator|Green|\n|:-|:-|\n|Manifesting-Generator|Orange|\n|Manifestor|Red|\n|Projector|Blue|\n|Reflector|Black|\n\nYou can edit the flair text if you like. I suggest adding your Profile and Authority in addition to type. The suggested format is: \\[Profile\\] \\[Authority\\] \\[Type\\]. My flair, for example, is \"2/4 Emotional Projector\".\n\nNote: Keep the color coding consistent. For example, if you're a Manifestor, choose the red Manifestor flair and edit the text if you want. Don't choose the blue Projector flair and edit the text to say Manifestor.\n\nLet me know if you have any flair-related suggestions!"

                "body": "So I just subscribed to regular Gamepass for 1\u20ac, and I went back to the manage subscription page and saw that the Ultimate subscription is also 1\u20ac and then 2 free months, and I think \"Damn, 3 months for 1\u20ac and then I downgrade to regular\".\n\nShould I just upgrade now? Or wait until my month expires (I already paid 1\u20ac for regular Game Pass trial) and then pay the Ultimate Trial? This way I get 4 months for 2\u20ac. Is it too good to be true? Should I just bite the bullet and pay another euro for Ultimate?\n\nOn the [Gamedeals Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/k5dh30/microsoft_xbox_game_pass_ultimate_1_month_1_get_2/) they say it lasts for 3 months. But maybe it will go away if I play a game on the regular subscription\n\nEdit: I just tried playing a game and the offer is still up. So I guess I'll wait until the final days of this plan to switch to the Ultimate subscription."

I was extremely confused at first. I thought to myself, maybe it's a semi-blue-collar job and they need strong boys to carry containers and glassware around, maybe, maybe...\n\nAnd then I found the obvious reason: female employees are unreliable because they will all get pregnant at one point and sabotage the company's productivity. Tip: I don't want to ever give birth to a child and I'm probably unable to since my genetic makeup is a lost lottery, but this boss somehow knows me and my future plans better than I do.

One of us has kids and she's constantly \"accidentally\" showing them off to profs in order to gain praise, sympathy and small privileges, because being a mom in college is difficult and eeeeeveryone must know that she's a hero *eyeroll*. One of the male professors is particularly fond of them. We mostly do the eyeroll when he starts talking about cute babies muh muh because that's not why we're here. We're here to fucking learn. One day he picked up our reaction, questioned us on our indifference towards cute babies on screen, we answered that most of us want to complete studies and find careers rather than becoming housewives and he was pretty upset about this, so he decided to share his good old wisdom with us.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a STEM class on Feynman path integrals turned into a breeder propaganda speech from a male whose maleness allows him to know more about our bodies, instincts, personalities, career and life choices than we will ever do *insert eye roll*.\n\n\"You'll all become mothers, this is your natural purpose and instinct, giving birth to cute little copies of your husband is the best achievement ever, the purpose of love is getting pregnant\" again and again and again. One of the two males in our class violently agreed. Of course he did. Trump is his political idol, in his opinion women are biologically destined to breed and stay at home, abortion is murder, we're psychopaths for disagreeing with him, our bodies do not belong to us, we're just vessels for evolution's plans (giving birth until we drop dead).\n\nNeedless to say, the class was a weird experience. 0/10 wouldn't recommend."

A random guy approached me and complimented me on my hat. I didn't answer because\n\n1. He had an extremely weird grin, I'm pretty good at differentiating between a normal smile and an uncomfortably flirty grin\u2122 and\n2. I was wearing earphones with music on max volume, which is an universal indicator of \"do not disturb\".\n\nThe guy was very upset about me not answering and started asking questions. \"Who are you?\" \"What's your name?\" They were personal questions. I backed off. At this point he got visibly annoyed and started touching me. I told him to fuck off, at which hell broke loose. He had a tantrum. Told me to go to hell, that I'm stupid, ugly, handicapped, a blind, that I'm probably a man under my clothes, that I don't know how to take a compliment. I'm not the type to freely swallow shit from others, so I answered with the same medicine: fuck off and go to hell.\n\nA vendor intervened and asked what the fuck was going on. He told the vendor that I was ungrateful and rude and I was insulting him and he was only trying to be nice\u2122. I explained the situation. I'm never in the mood to flirt with random strangers. The nice guy\u2122 said that he wasn't trying to flirt with me since I was so rude, hideous and masculine(?).\n\nHe ended the conversation with \"Why on Earth would you think I'd want to flirt with you? I've got a wife!\", to which I answered \"I'm so sorry for her\", got my order and yeeted myself out of that place.\n\nAt one point during our encounter I told him that I was going to call the police. He laughed and told me that the police isn't going to do anything. Unfortunately, he was 100% right.\n\nAccording to the vendor, I'm not the first person to be harassed by him. There are CCTVs nearby and everything is caught on tape, but the police doesn't care about the complaints because of the prevalent \"if he didn't rape you he didn't commit any crime\" mentality. Welcome to 2022, where you can freely harass women for not prettily smiling back at you and nobody gives a shit. Looking great so far!\n\nThe thing I regret most is that now I can't go to that place anymore because of him. I liked their pie. Fuck this."

                "body": "This is my first post and English isn't my first language so who knows how well this will go but I have a weird story I would like to share with you guys.\n\n\\_\n\nThis happened quite a long time ago, I was around 12-14, it's hard to remember. I was having fun with my friend at my house and we decided to be stupid by taking pictures of ourselves planking (yes, I know, I'm still cringing to this day) it was fun at first but when it was my turn to pose and my friend took my picture it got weird.\n\nInstead of a picture, there was a video, however, it looked like it was bizarrely edited. The camera was slightly moving around as if the person holding it wasn't standing completely still. Everything else looked like it was stuck in time, nothing was moving, not me, not the trees in the window, nothing. As crazy as it sounds it literally looked like someone had stopped time and filmed it. (the video was pretty glitchy and out of focus)\n\nThe video went on like that for a bit, just showing my frozen in time body laying there, doing the fuckin plank until a low (maybe male) voice went \"P\u00f5, p\u00f5 p\u00f5 p\u00f5 p\u00f5i p\u00f5i.\" (sounds like a bunch of nonsense but the way the voice said it made it sound like a real language) The video ended right after that. The voice in the video didn't sound evil or anything in case ya guys gonna suggest it was paranormal but I was still freaked out. Never showed the video to my friend I was with, just deleted it and tried to act as if it never happened to forget about it.\n\nNow, of course, I wish I had kept the video to maybe figure out what it truly was but I don't blame my younger self either, it was pretty fucking scary. I like to think it was aliens since that would be hella dope but being more realistic it was probably just my phone glitching out in a weird way (hopefully).\n\nWe'll never know.\n\n(***Edit\\_1:*** *I'm not sure if this is even the right subreddit for this story so if not do let me know)*\n\n*(****Edit\\_2****: If any of you know if there's a way to recover deleted videos from an Android LG plz let me know!)*\n\n(**Edit\\_3:** For those who are wondering what \"p\u00f5\" sounded like, just google translate p\u00f5 in Estonian)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**EDIT\\_4 (08.05.19):**\n\nSo I tried a few programs and apps to recover the video but nothing worked, if any of you know an app/program that works please please tell me! Meanwhile, I'll also try checking another phone since maybe I remember it wrong and the incident happened with the device I had before the LG. (Currently waiting for the other phone to charge.)\n\n**EDIT\\_5 (21.05.19):**\n\nAlright, it's been a long time and perhaps this story has been forgotten about already but I just wanted to say that I haven't been able to recover the video. I'm sorry to those who were eager to see it. At least I was able to share my story with ya guys. \n\nOh and the second phone never started working even after multiple days of charging, the battery probably died and hell I have no idea where someone might be selling batteries for a phone that old.\n\n(If something changes in the future I'll certainly update even if its gonna be years later xd)"

However, a graduate of our school recently posted on Instagram that the school is doing us a disservice by not offering APs. They shared that they \"highly recommend\" for current students to take AP tests outside of school, and that they have to retake many math classes instead of fulfilling their major requirements because they do not have any credits. I DM'ed them to ask about and they told me that it's very helpful to go into college with some credits knocked out of the way because you will not receive credit even for something you have already done if it wasn't AP. They also said that it's particularly helpful for STEM majors. I'm not planning to become a STEM major so would this still apply to me? And do you think it would be beneficial for me to go out of my way to take AP tests so I won't be behind on credits? Thank you <3"

I felt very nauseous and I forced myself to throw up, so I ended up throwing up on and off for about 5 hours at night. I felt great after vomiting literally everything that I had in my stomach.\n\nThe next day I ate diet food (soup with boiled, bland chicken). I couldn't sleep at night though because I felt that the chicken wasn't digesting properly. So for the next 5 days or so I was on an even stricter soup diet and I was fine. After those 5 days I thought I was 100% healed but it turns out I wasn't - I ate some sweets and pasta carbonara (which is fat) and I felt AWFUL, nauseous, I felt like I had indigestion, and I also had a bit of acid reflux and chest pains. The stomach felt big or inflamed, like I couldn't even wear tight jeans. There was a lot of belching in the beginning as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEver since November 2022 I've had continuous stomach issues - they haven't gone away. I feel better now than in November, but I still have some **symptoms**:\n\n\\- I feel full immediately and I feel like I have indigestion if I eat red meat, sweets, fat food, or spices. My stomach becomes hard if I press it and it just feels uncomfortable.\n\n\\- If I eat sweets I even have a bit of acid reflux and chest pains.\n\n\\- I noticed that drinking a bit of diluted apple cider vinegar during/after a heavy meal helps digestion.\n\n\\- I react best to vegetables and salads (cooked AND raw vegetables). I find this really weird as you'd think that raw vegetables would be hard to digest, but no. I feel great after eating raw fiber.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe gastroenterologist performed some **tests** and **they all came back normal**:\n\n\\- Abdominal ultrasound\n\n\\- Stool test to detect bacteria incl. Helicobacter\n\n\\- Endoscopy + Helicobacter test\n\n\\- Blood tests: Bilirubin, Alkaline Phosphatase, Aspartate Transferase, Alanine Transferase, Gamma GT, Total Protein, Albumin, Globulin, as well as all Hematology tests.\n\nShe said that my stomach looks great and refused to take a sample for biopsy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is this? Can this be some sort of a microscopic gastritis?"

My new house\n\nSo I 20m and my dad 42m are moving in together after never living together. He\u2019s very ocd and particular but we get a long well. He is just a little hard to get a long with sometimes for various reasons. Any way I\u2019m just trying to get comfortable with this idea and the logistics and I feel like I\u2019m walking on ice around everything right now. I still want to do it but I really want to make sure he is happy too because he\u2019s sacrificing a lot for this and I respect him. But it\u2019s just very stressful for me.\n\n2. The girl I have been talking to.\n\nI\u2019m going to refer to her as Emma but Emma is a very strange case. I\u2019m a weird guy and I can admit it, she is extremely weird though. Enough to where it\u2019s almost difficult to talk to her sometimes but I really appreciate her personality. That being said I have a hard time navigating someone like her and I\u2019m just trying to get used to her quirks and it\u2019s rough. She\u2019s also very guarded and it\u2019s difficult to keep a conversation going because she refuses to talk about her self for any length of time. Recently she\u2019s been kind of sad and down in the dumps. I\u2019d really like to do something for her just to kinda brighten things up but we\u2019re not close enough to be consistently hanging out or anything which makes it tough. I\u2019m just trying to figure out the right words to say to show that I want to support her I guess.\n\n3. Lastly my friends have been very difficult lately. They both broke up with their girlfriends and are not taking it well. For about a month now they have wanted me to hang out like every day and I just don\u2019t have the social battery for that. Especially when they\u2019re always asking for advice and just completely ignoring it. They constantly talk about alcohol drugs clubbing and girls but that\u2019s just not something I care about. I want to have actual conversations and they\u2019re making it so difficult but now they\u2019re saying I don\u2019t care and that I\u2019m distancing myself when I\u2019m just tired of being used for entertainment. Feels like there is nothing I can do right for them or me and especially not simultaneously. \n\nI just wish I could have a good nights rest for once."

On one half people are saying if you buy a 600cc+ motorcycle that if you don\u2019t know how to ride when you sit on it you will literally burst into flames or something. However on the other hand it seems to be common knowledge that 600cc AND ABOVE bikes are amazing beginners i.e. MT-07, SV650, trident 660, etc.\n\nSo what\u2019s the difference? Is it the type of engine? Are the dangerous ones the inline 4s like the cbr650rs? Or is it just all 600cc bikes and people are just in two different camps? Because I could totally be down with getting an sv650 with a V-twin in it but if I will in fact die upon touching it then I\u2019ll just downgrade.\n\nI just want to be able to comfortably hit 100 so I don\u2019t get clapped on the highway\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone that answered my question. I wasn\u2019t trying to buy a zx6r or anything just confused on the difference between 600cc i4 sport bikes and 650cc parallel twins. Please try and read the post before you roast someone else next time"

I think the deck is still very powerful but it can still lose now.\n\nHowever my other experienced friend builds his own decks and usually has insanely destructive win cons inside, such as crater hoof behemoth or he had a card that was unblockable and gave 11 poison counters.\n\nI think it\u2019s fine for a little give and take but I specifically took out my win con because they asked me too but have no complaints about his even if they function extremely similarly. \n\nOverall the boardstate just doesn\u2019t feel fair most of the time and when I play one of my precons it just still feels unfair because of this one dude. Is there an easy tool or chart to describe how we can all have even power levels?"

I dont wanna be the devils advocate, especially for a tiktok influencer like mikayla, whom i always perceived as overly fake and a try-hard. \nNevertheless, nowadays im getting real scared of how desensitized younger ppl are to getting plastic work done.\n\nOfc im not completely against it, i do support minimal interventions,or when there are disfigurements that reduce life quality greatly, but only if the person still ends up being recognizable. \nMikayla is still a young adult, her brain hasnt completely finalized maturing, so let her be and still express insecurities.\n\nImagine she actually gets plastic surgery done, and somewhere around the age of 26-27, she'd finally grow into herself and would start loving the face her genetics gifted her with.\n\nImagine the regret that would set in, realizing you erased centuries of your direct family genetics you show to the world. \nFearing that your family starts believing you intentionally got rid of your fathers bigger, slightly crooked nose, your mothers thin lips and your grandpas downturned eyebrows your family was so proud of, just bc you were ashamed of how they looked like on pictures and videos online. \n\nHow would the family actually think of you? Would they be disappointed secretly, thinking you turned your back on them? Would they resent you? Or would they also start being insecure of the features you intentionally got rid of? \n\nSo in this case just let mikayla mature more, grow into the features she has and give her the chance to start looking at these features with pride. Let her continue filter herself into oblivion, embarass herself which stills leaves her the choice open to embrace her natural self.\n\nThe amount of young adults who regret not letting themselves grow into their genetics nowadays is too damn high. \n\nLiving with pride of your familys facial features is so much more valuable and peaceful in the long term, than looking like all the other Instagram \"influencers\", all having the same kinda 'LA face', then continue being insecure & getting that short lived euphoria kick through getting more facial interventions until you end up being either unrecognizable or uncanny valley.",

The 3 toms always want to go outside, but since theyre a very expensive and \"extravagant\" looking breed, i always had the fear that they easily would get stolen of i ever let them roam around free by themselves. Either that, or ppl would straight think that they're wild cats, bc of their fur color/ long hair.\nSo bc of this i started walking them on a leash. It was hard at first, we needed to start very small steps and progress is long, but its very rewarding. My cats and I have deepened our bond, they go outside with me daily and dont ask me any longer to go outside by their own.\n\nMaybe that would come as an option for you?\nAnd apart from that, ofc you may get a 2nd opinion from another vet, maybe there are any possible options left for your poor kitty cat.

I know it's not even one of the best of the series so I was expecting my nostalgia to be tainted while revisiting the game but NOT AT ALL. The game has flaws but it is also super charming and quirky. More melancholic on some aspects. And way more difficult, which makes every achievement extremely satisfying. The time goes by more quickly which makes the days feel productive and not boring.\n\nAnd honestly it makes me look at PooT with more disappointment now that I realise that even HM DS is way better. I loved ToT and SoS1 as well, and then, the titles went downward. I hope the series goes back to more lively and quirky villagers, more fantasy, more difficulty and more love."

They all correspond to a Chaos God. (I consider Slaanesh to exist outside of these separation because she is as much an Eldar God as a Chaos God imo)\n\nIsha/Nurgle: both gods of life and nature. They are also the only ones in their pantheon that seem to care for their worshippers more than the basic servant/master dynamic. Isha in a motherly way and Nurgle in a grandfatherly way. One is also in love with the other, which makes complete sense if they\u2019re two sides of the same entity.\n\nKhaine/Khorne: honestly they\u2019re basically the same bloke in both mannerisms and appearance. They are both gods of fire, war, and honor. They are both characterized by their unending rage. The Dark Eldar seem to believe the only separation between the two is one of degree. Khaine representing honorable combat, and Khorne representing pure bloodlust. Although, there is evidence to suggest Khorne is Khaine\u2019s father. This leads me to believe maybe all of these pairs are related in more of that way.\n\nCegorach/Tzeentch: Both trickster gods. Both seem to be closer to eldritch horror gods since I have heard some describe Cegorach as a god of horror as well as a laughing god. They are both also mysterious as hell, the Harlequins being among the most mysterious fuckers in the whole setting. And to put a cherry on top, they both seem to have knowledge of the future. One of the more significant recent events in Eldar lore is the opening of the Book of *Fate*, a book supposedly written by Cegorach himself depicting the end times in detail. Who knows what other books in the Black Library he\u2019s written.\n\nAnyway yeah. I\u2019ve heard plenty make the connection between Khorne and Khaine, but I haven\u2019t seen as much regarding the other 4. The most I\u2019ve seen is \u201cIsha is a goddess of life, that\u2019s why Nurgle fancies her\u201d. I definitely haven\u2019t seen anything about Cegorach and Tzeentch.\n\nAll this points to the theory that the reason these three Eldar gods survived in particular is because they are all related directly to the three other Chaos gods and therefore can\u2019t be killed like that.\n\n(As a side note, I would like to make a connection between the Eldar smithing god and the possible maybe sorta machine chaos god but there\u2019s not much there\u2026)"

Now I am reading into the codex and stuff to learn what rules I need to pay attention to when putting together a list but I just wanted to ask you guys possible lists and general thoughts on what I currently have. Most of these are either minis that I had already bought before I decided I wanted to get into the gameplay or minis that I know I 100% want to run but yeah.\n\nI plan to run Kabal of the Obsidian Rose:\n\n-10 Kabalites \n\n-10 Wyches\n\n-5 Incubi (including Klaivex)\n\n-5 scourges(-1 depending on WYSIWYG\u2026)\n\n-5 Mandrakes\n\n-Drazhar\n\n-1 Archon\n\n-1 Succubus\n\n-1 Talos Pain Engine\n\nI\u2019m also playing around with idea of adding a Harlequin detachment. Here\u2019s what I have for those:\n\n-2 Harlequin Skyweavers (-1 WYSIWYG)\n\n-10 Players(-1 WYSIWYG)\n\n-2 Death Jesters\n\n-1 Shadowseer\n\n-2 Troupe Masters\n\n(I know, I have a problem)\n\nWhenever I post questions like these, they tend to get downvoted but I\u2019m just an idiot trying to learn the complexities of army building. Have mercy lol\n\nPS: the WYSIWYG thing is because some of the models have kind of custom parts and weapons so they may or may not be illegal on the tabletop (I.e. extra arms as to have 4, or having a two handed rifle in one arm, but still holding a sword in the other). I\u2019ve been told WYSIWYG can be pretty strict so I\u2019m just covering my bases\u2026"

Mostly from Pork and eggs.\n\nWhich i had a craving for during day 10-15. Mostly the craving was for Sausage which i ate for a few days.\n\nOther than that, i've only eaten PUFA's one day and it was on a birthday celebration for my father.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positive things that has happened.**\n\nWeight is stable. Usually it was either increasing or decreasing much. But now its stable, very stable.\n\nI've been eating what i want. That includes Ice cream, fruits, home made candies or desserts.\n\nI have actually eaten ice cream every day.\n\nStable food has been Ground beef. My body loves it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positive things in short:**\n\nLess depressed\n\nTaking more action\n\nCleaning my apartment more\n\nExtremely many epiphanies, i can wake up in the morning and have a revelation of some sorts. More on this later.\n\nMy brain works much better, i can actually focus on things for a few min without feeling the need to look elsewhere.\n\nLess dopamine dependent.\n\nLess cold sensitive.\n\nNot as carb sensitive. Normalizing insulin levels?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that i am actually writing this is amazing me even to this day.\n\nYesterday i told myself that i was going to write this and here i am.\n\nNot putting it off, no excuses just writing.\n\nLiberating and it feels wonderful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think also ive been able to connect to a few of my friends more these days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm much less codependent on others. Which has been my bane over these past years. Almost to the point of asking others for permission to do things.\n\nI am starting to do things for me and me alone. It's quite amazing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tests i've conducted on myself.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Nightshade test.**\n\nDay 20 i tested to eat a stew that contained three different types of Nightshades.\n\nPeppers, Potatoes and Tomatoes(pur\u00e9 and crushed).\n\nIt was basically a stew made from these three, onion, garlic, ground beef.\n\nThe result was a huge wave of brain fog and a migraine like headache.\n\nPain in my leg showed up after 24 hours.\n\nSoooo... I am avoiding nightshades now.\n\nDepressive like symptoms lifted after around 60 hours.\n\n**Soy Lecithin test. (Chocolate bar)**\n\nAffects me negatively, but not very much. Acceptable in small amounts on weekends.\n\n**Sorghum pancake test.**\n\nMade me tired, very tired.. Seems like nothing else. Avoiding\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLife really seems to improve a lot fast.\n\nIf you got any questions i'll try and answer as many as i can."

But i'll throw a hail mary.\n\n6 Days ago i found out that Pufas suck and is in almost everything, through the \"What ive learned\" video about Seed oils i learned that this might be the thing responsible for my poor health.\n\nSo i quit Pufas immediately, threw out all foods that contains them and started to eat pufa free.\n\nSo, Pre-pufa-free i experienced the following problems.\n\nLow Energy, Lethargy, ADHD like motivation/discipline(unable to act even if i wanted to), Depression and probably many other things.\n\nSo day 5. What has happened?\n\nAlready at day 3 i noticed small changes in energy and motivation. Usually i had to push with all my might to just do the dishes. But today i did the dishes, vacuumed, sorted a few things and half the day i  spent helping my mother with various tasks.  Sidenote, i also slept extremely well that night.\n\nThis behavior just seems to improve with each coming day. I sleep better and i do more things every day.\n\nToday i woke up, started clean my clothes, did the dishes and am writing this. My thoughts are more focused and i dont feel like a zombie, Even though i am actually very tired. I feel more in control of my day.\n\nIf this continues,  who knows what might happen. I feel that i want to learn things today.\n\nDo you want me to update you guys at around day 20-30?"

                "body": "Disclaimer: I have been up for almost 2 days, so sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes in advance. I\u2019m very tired.\n\nI\u2019m an 18 year old girl and have recently been diagnosed with ADHD. On Thursday I was prescribed 36 mg of Concerta. Yesterday I woke up at 5:35 am and then picked it up and took it at 10 am and then ate immediately after, before it kicked in. After about 30 minutes I started to feel euphoric and very relaxed. I then started to feel very tired and drowsy at around 12:30 pm. This lasted until about 2 pm and then I started to feel very motivated like never before and like I could concentrate on my studies. So then I studied Korean from 2 pm to around 7 pm without looking at my phone or getting distracted. I literally lost all interest in the things that distracted me before. I was actually so happy and emotional that I could finally focus. The only downside I had noticed thus far is that I had literally no appetite but I could drink a lot of water. I also bought a soda on the way home from the pharmacy and after my medicine kicked in I had no interest in it, which is unusual because I am a sugar-aholic. Has anyone else experienced this?\n\nHaving no appetite really isn\u2019t good for me because I\u2019m 5\u20197 (170 cm) and naturally 110 lbs (49.9 Kg), which is underweight and if I continue barely eating anything throughout the day I feel as though I will eventually become severely underweight or anorexic. I have a fast metabolism and usually eat two meals a day of whatever I want and snack throughout the day and night. I feel like I can\u2019t afford to lose more than 5 lbs. I am starting to think that the dose might be to high for my weight?\n\nI also only slept 2 hours last night. I was very tired because I was up since 5:30 am Friday and I tried to sleep at 9:30 pm but couldn\u2019t sleep because my mind was racing way more than usual, all I could think about is how excited I am to do my Korean homework tmrw, which is very out of the ordinary for me lol. I also kept grinding my teeth (not normal), twitching in my sleep (not normal), and getting up to use the bathroom more than usual because of how much water I was drinking. I somehow fell asleep around 2:40 am and woke up around 4:40 am (when I woke up I felt like I didn\u2019t sleep at all.) I did something stupid and took the concerta right when I woke up hoping that it would relax me again like it did the first time but nope. It got worse and I couldn\u2019t go back to sleep. It was overall a horrible night. \n\nToday I felt like an actual zombie. I tried sleeping for a couple more hours around 8 am, but my mind would not shut off. It still hasn\u2019t shut off and it is now 8:30 pm Saturday as I\u2019m writing this. I took 10 mg melatonin and vitamin C and it did nothing. I had bad insomnia before where I would stay awake for up to 24 hours but now it\u2019s even worse. I honestly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m even functioning at this point. Has anyone experienced anything similar and has it gotten better? \n\nMy mom called the psychiatrist this morning but no one answered, I think because it\u2019s Saturday. I will have to wait till Tuesday because Monday is a holiday. But I have Korean class on Monday and I don\u2019t want to take the medicine anymore, but I can\u2019t focus without it. I don\u2019t know if the dose is too high or if this isn\u2019t the right medication for me? It really helped me to focus but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the severe insomnia. It\u2019s 8:53 pm now and I have been trying to sleep since 4:30 pm. I would really like to know if anyone has experienced anything similar? I\u2019m looking forward to reading about your personal experiences!"

When we went out, we laughed together and seemed to agree on so many points.\n\nYesterday, however, he broke up with me because he reinitiated a contact with a person he was already seeing prior to us start talking. At the time, their relationship had cooled down a bit and that\u2019s why he reached out to me.\n\nI sort of saw that coming, though. As much as we were interested in each other, he always seemed a bit off. Something inside me knew I couldn\u2019t just completely give myself in.\n\nIn any case, I\u2019m absolutely heartbroken. I have this feeling of absolute hopelessness that I\u2019ll never find someone who matched me as much as he did. Seems like he had everything *but* the most important thing\u2026 requited feelings.

Went to to OB/GYN today because I'm interested in getting an IUD. He presented the options, but seems like you can either get the non-hormonal one and suffer endlessly from cramps and long, intense periods or maybe get pretty bad hormonal acne (I'm also predisposed, even had to be on Accutane about five years ago) with Kyleena or Mirena.\n\nSo, I'm thinking about relying only on condoms but I really want to hear what are you guys' experiences with that one. I don't intend to ever have sex without it (while I don't get sterilized), have seen a bunch of videos on how to use it correctly.\n\nSo, for those relying only condoms, could you tell more about it? Do you guys still do it? Any regrets?\n\nThank you everyone so much in advance for hearing these ramblings and to those who are keen to share."

Despite this and being very familiar with the film, I have recently encountered an instance of the Mandela Effect. During the gypsy camp scene, just before the first gun shot is fired, one of the gypsy girls holds a glass bottle just above the other girl's head ready to bludgeon her with it. For the longest time, I thought that that first gun shot shatters the bottle. I was certain of it. However, the bottle doesn't break and I feel like I've seen a different version of the film than the one in my memory! I then realised that this memory came from the video game version of that scene from the 2005 game where that distinctly happened.\n\nMy question is: have you encountered the Mandela Effect during any of your viewings of the Bond films? The 'Dolly with braces' phenomenon in 'Moonraker' is well documented, but have you seen any others?"

I was surprised that America got the different subtitle of 'Ripto's Rage!' and got frankly jealous. To me, 'Ripto's Rage!' is a much better subtitle. It's punchy and to the point; whereas, I think 'Gateway to Glimmer' is a meandering title with too many syllables. Granted, it's a better subtitle than the generic and presumably censored 'Locked and Loaded' for Insomniac's later game 'Ratchet and Clank 2: Going Commando' in Europe. \n\nMy question is: which subtitle do you prefer? If you're European, are you angry that Reignited made 'Ripto's Rage' the default subtitle to Spyro 2?"

I know I should probably see a therapist about this, but after 25 years of living with Ns and being constantly told that \"only crazy people / deranged lunatics see therapists\" I struggle with the idea of finding one who will listen to me.\n\nThe few people that I actually talk to are mostly people I work with now, but I don't see or talk to them outside of work. Working night shift also makes it very difficult to get out and meet new people. Additionally, I have pretty severe depression post-chemotherapy, so I already struggle with motivation to do anything.\n\nThe last couple of weeks, I've gotten back to my apartment (at around 3 am) and felt that if I didn't have a dog I would have absolutely no one. I want to start dating but I realize that I am not emotionally mature enough to even try to date. I don't want to be a nagging clingy person like my Ns were to me, so it's just best if I don't right now.\n\nCan anyone provide any resources on how to heal from emotional abuse and manipulation? I don't know where to start but I know that I need help and I'm willing to admit that to myself. I guess that's a better place to start than nothing at all."

That said I find that I find myself too reliant on atomos so I'm thinking of investing on a nice primary. Need a good primary to invest in that covers what atomos lacks like range. Currently MR9 but higher MR weapon suggestions are nice too so I can path my investments. A good MR10 weapon or less with most its mods being applicable to higher MR weapons would be nice though."

Is it not known to most social democrats that the nordic model is social corporatism/tripartism? I find that they are often conflicted when I point this out due to the fact that the economic model of fascism is corporatism as well making it seem like social democracy is a less authoritarian form of fascism. \"The moderate wing of fascism\" as Stalin described.

I'm especially into vocal production, but I'm trying to sharpen my mixing and mastering skills at the moment.\n\n**Here is a list of plugins I already own:**\n\n* Abbey Road Saturator\n* Abbey Road TG Mastering Chain\n* H-Delay Hybrid Delay\n* H-Reverb Hybrid Reverb\n* S1 Stereo Imager\n* Vocal Rider\n* DeBreath\n* Doubler\n* Renaissance Axx\n* Renaissance Channel\n* Renaissance DeEsser\n* Waves Tune\n* Vocal Bender\n* Also got most Goodhertz plugins (vulf compressor).\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/o92n50)"

I trust him completely, so theoretically, I'm not that afraid to confess to him. If I were to confess to him, I'd need to get him alone first, which I don't really know how to either. Now my dilemma.\nI have zero dating experience. I've liked people in the past, but growing up I was very shy and awkward around my crushes, so I never confessed to anyone, I've also never kissed anyone or anything. \nI feel like I have a fair chance that this friend might like me back, but since I know him so well, I feel like I need to gain some experience/outside perspective on dating before I risk it. However, at the same time, I'm not really interested in dating anyone else, because I'm pretty into my crush. So I don't know what I should do with all of this now.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for me on this matter? \ud83d\ude05"

I have an intense fear of home invasion and living in a house would place me in a constant state of anxiety. Making sure every window, door, back door, gate, everything, is locked. Even then, a window can be easily broken. The thought of being up in some other room and suddenly hearing a break-in makes my heart race. As a kid, when I use to live I. large two story houses, I would always feel anxiety when home alone or in a secluded section of the house. There\u2019s too much \u201chouse\u201d to think about. I enjoy apartments as they typically have one entrance and windows are hard to reach if you\u2019re not on the first floor. Town houses are passable as a singular unit can blend in and are typically in busy urban areas were a break-in attempt can more likely have more witnesses. \n\nThank you for coming to my little anxiety vent."

Every. Time.\n\nThing is, now, after 8 years, we've decided to give into our feelings for each other again, but I'm kinda freaked out, cuz I see his name *and* last name everywhere! I also keep seeing the number 222 everywhere, and 22 has always been my lucky number! I heard this can be a sign of being close to your twin flame, but I just don't know what to think!\n\nAlso, I've read that in this type of relationship, there's always a runner and a chaser, and BOY DO I FEEL LIKE RUNNING!

A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce with the statement: \"this is the lettuce you eat at burger king\" admittedly, he had shoes on, but that's even worse. The post went live at 11:38 pm on july 16th. And a mere 20 minutes later, the burger king in question was alerted to the rouge employee. At least, I hope he's rouge. How did it happen? well, the BK employee had it removed the exif data from the uploaded photo which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. Five minutes later the news station was contacted by another 4chaner and three minutes later at 11:58, a link was posted. BK's \"tell us about us\" online form, the foot photo, otherwise known as Exhibit A was attached. Cleveland scene magazine contacted the BK in question. The next day, when questioned, the breakfast shift manager said: \"Oh I know who that is. He's getting fired.\" Mystery solved by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace."

She doesn't have a job because she lost her last one due to being fired. they were a bad company so I do feel bad abt it, but at the same time I bet she could've gotten a new job by now if she wanted. it's been several months since & I'm starting to think she doesn't want to get one & just have me continuously pay her. A couple of instances that really upset me abt this is that a few weeks ago she told me, \"I don't think I'll get a job anytime soon. I feel like I'm being led to stay at home & be around the family more, especially your dad. I feel like one of us doesn't have much time alive.\" when she told me that it upset me. my dad had cancer a few years back but he's doing mostly fine now. not only does the thought scare me, but at the same time it feels like a tactic to make me be ok with giving her so much $ every week, or make me feel bad & obligated to give her $. another instance happened a couple days ago, she texted me, \"can we move the day you send me $ to Friday? you pay me Mondays but all the bills come out Friday.\" I replied, \"yes but didn't I already send you $200 for this week on Saturday like u asked?\" she said yes so I thought that showed her I wouldn't be sending her any more this week since I already did but no. she texted me this morning saying to send the $200. (so I gave her $400 this week.) I live at home, 21f, and my job pays $14.50 an hour. My parents have consistently been bad with money and I grew up poor, partially from what I believe to be bad money habits. while my siblings still lived here, she also made them pay her money (or bills). my older brother told my older sister \"they don't really need ur help\" when she was having to shell out her entire paychecks to mom while she was living here. the bills part is understandable, but being made to send HER money seems so unfair and stupid considering how bad she is with money. It feels like flushing money down the drain bc I know she isn't financially responsible. I hate going to a job I hate & then having to pay her half of what I get every week just for her to turn around & make me pay her that much AGAIN which results in me being out a whole check. AITA for being upset by this whole situation, & for feeling like I was tricked into sending her 400 this week? I feel like I'm a cashcow to her. I used to pay a few bills for the household but now I feel like I'm giving handouts to my mother who blows it any time she has it. she was several hundred dollars in the hole when I initially started sending her $200 a week. my older sis says mom told her she feels bad abt having to ask for money from me but it doesn't feel that way when she takes it from me so willingly. I try to put all of the money I don't give her into savings bc I dont want to be in the same financial situation as my parents (esp mom) & I'm planning on moving in with my SO in the future."

We were teleported into my living room, which was our class, my Technology teacher entered the room, greeted us, and started teaching.

From a strictly financial perspective she was effectively destitute throughout the entirety of med school.

Most likely, no. Speaking from personal experience, I was in a relationship with a woman who had a very strong friendship with her ex-husband. They would get coffee together, or meet up for lunch, that sort of thing. They texted frequently. Although I was also insecure about this at first, it became apparent that there was nothing at all untoward going on between the two of them. They simply had a great relationship, and it remained that way until he passed away unexpectedly. Now she has that kind of relationship with me, and frankly it is quite refreshing when compared to some of my other exes. But there is absolutely nothing between us, and never will be again.

These changes permanently alter a person's ability to control their usage of the substance(s) they have become addicted to. In other words, they can't stop themselves, nor can they stop the cravings they experience.\n\nPeople who have successfully overcome an addiction are still addicts. The difference is that they have learned how to ignore the cravings and push past them, thus avoiding the use of the drug they became addicted to in the first place. Over the course of several years these altered neural pathways become less prominent, though they can never be fully repaired to their pre-addiction state. The cravings can become \"dampened,\" or weaker, as a result, but they never go away completely. Unfortunately, even a single use of the addicted substance is enough to put the addict back at square one. This is why they need to avoid the substance completely, rather than only using it \"once in a while.\"\n\nEdit:  \nFor those who are curious, the source is a good friend of mine who literally studied and conducted research on addiction in a neuroscience lab. Since I was working on a PhD in psychology at the time, we naturally discussed this topic a great deal.\n\nWe (as a society) have only relatively recently begun to develop a good understanding of how addiction works. Other comments I see in this thread reflect popular, and outdated, views on the nature of addiction. It will take some time before these misconceptions catch up with the science.",

Full disclosure: I have not yet read the study itself, but I probably will end up doing so shortly.\n\nThe upshot of the study is that there has been a big decline in sexual activity of all kinds and at all age groups up to age 49 since 2009. This includes intercourse, masturbation, and oral. We don't know exactly why this is happening, but the researchers believe there are several contributing factors such as the rising popularity of social media, video games, and rough sex. With sociological phenomena like this it is never just one thing driving the change.\n\nImportantly, the data collection for the study was concluded in 2018, which means COVID wasn't even a factor in the results.\n\nThoughts on this?"

And if they did that, does that mean I only have \\~$50 in BAS for the second half of the month? \n\nAlso, from everything I've read, \\~$239 is a super low BAS. That might be because I'm in tech school, but again I'm just generally confused on everything right now.\n\nI guess my main question is, can I exceed my BAS eating at the DFAC and get charged the overage? Can BAS run out? I didn't think that was supposed to happen."

And another. And another. It\u2019s been three weeks and three paychecks since my last \u201clegitimate\u201d paycheck. I checked my pay stubs (which I still have access to) and they record me as working my normal ~50 hour week for these extra checks.\n\nSo right now I\u2019m sitting on $2000 I shouldn\u2019t have, and there\u2019s no sign the checks will stop coming. I notified my old boss immediately upon discovering the issue, and he told me the district manager would look into it. I haven\u2019t heard anything from him yet.\n\nMy question is, how do I return the money? From what I\u2019ve read, employers can\u2019t reverse deposits after five business days. If I just write them a check, what are the tax ramifications? They\u2019ve deducted taxes from the money automatically. To further complicate things, I work for a contract company, so they\u2019re probably still getting paid by the company I was contracted to for services I have not been providing."

I'm torn between two options:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Apply upwards lift until you release the button, then immediately apply downwards force. This is used in most modern metroidvanias and allows for tighter platforming.\n\n2) Tap for a short jump, keep holding for extra height. More common in older games and stuff like Smash Bros, feels more floaty, smooth and \"believable\". This is currently what I'm using.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich do you prefer and why? Any insights welcome. Also, I'd appreciate comments about wall jumping, since there isn't a consensus about which inputs to use (just jumping next to a wall, jumping + moving in the opposite direction, etc.), whether to delay the jump a little or be immediate, jumping on the same wall, etc.\n\n\nEdit: my game does play kinda like a metroidvania so it makes sense to use type 1, but I do like how type 2 feels. I'm happy with how it plays but obviously I'm super biased."

Rationally, you'd think that the arm that moves forwards is the opposite of the leg moving forwards, just like walking or running, to keep the balance. And indeed, it looks like pros do that. But when I try it it feels off. I end up feeling more comfortable just putting the same arm forwards as the foot. Yesterday I managed to do it right, but it feels A) forced and B) inconsequential. Like it doesn't make much difference really. I don't feel I lose balance or anything weird regardless of what I do with my arms, the torso alignment and legwork alone handle most of it. I think it also feels forced because of how when rollerblading the strides are longer and fluid/ \"circular\" without stomping with each step, so if I try to mirror that with my arms it feels like I'm jokingly pretending to run in slo-mo or like inside jelly, and it's less natural. And then there's the people that just rollerblade with their hands behind their back.\n\n\nAny insights about this?"

By the time I can pay attention to the angle of my feet it's already time to slow down if I don't want to crash.\n\n\nI'm trying to learn how to to turn around but it's not going particularly great, and I've managed to learn how to slow down by making the triangle with my knees but it's way too subtle and as mentioned I end up feeling a lot of pressure on my feet afterwards.\n\n\nWhat can I do to improve my stability? Should I just learn a different braking technique or am I just doing the one I'm using wrong and it should be more painless and effective?"

                "body": "In one of the more controversial endings in Star Trek, Riker kills Yuta with his phaser when she tries to kill the Gatherer leader Chorgan. This is after he had warned her to back off and after he had repeatedly hit her with lesser phaser fire that was clearly having an effect. The question has always been: was the killing necessary? I have heard arguments from both sides - that it was cruel and needless to kill her when he could have stunned her or beamed her out, while others argue that it was too risky to do anything other than what he did.\n\nThe problem I have with these arguments is that they both miss the bigger picture. Imagine if Riker had kept his phaser on that second-to-last setting, and hit Yuta repeatedly until she collapsed unconscious and is taken into custody. Well, what happens then? The Federation can't prosecute her - neither she nor her victims are members of the Federation, nor did the murders take place in Federation territory. As we learn a few episodes later in \"A Matter of Perspective\", the Federation is obligated to defer to whatever jurisdiction applies in a particular criminal matter, and their jurisdiction in Yuta's case is zilch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I don't think the Acamarians would be able to prosecute her either. She has been killing Gatherers, and the Gatherers are treated not as rebels who are actually still under Acamarian law, but as a group that has separated and has formed its own society (albeit an unruly one). This society would have its own legal system, no matter how primitive, and thus they would be entitled to the legal right to prosecute the one who has been killing their members. (Not to mention there really is no way the Acamarians can obtain Yuta, as besides herself and Marouk there is just one other assistant dude and they're on a Gatherer ship full of militant guards.) And while Chorgan wouldn't want to get near Yuta, the others under his command would probably be more than happy to dispense their version of \"justice\" on Yuta when they find out what she's been doing. As for what that may be, Chorgan himself said, \"You will never leave this ship alive\", though that's probably the last act in a rather unpleasant list of horrible things they will probably do, such as rape, physical torture, psychological torture, mutilation, etc. As terrible as these punishments are, there really isn't much the Federation can do to stop them. In the episode \"Transfigurations\", we hear Picard lamenting that \"it's not up to us to judge their laws,\" when the Zalkonians were demanding the return of John Doe so they could execute him (and unlike Yuta, John Doe hadn't even done anything morally wrong). If the Federation abducted anyone they wanted to spare from the death penalty, they would probably have made a host of enemies all around them and a reputation that they like to interfere in other cultures' matters of law. I just don't see them doing that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis of course raises the question as to what Riker was hoping to accomplish by having Yuta back down. She's still murdered at least two people, and probably dozens - if not hundreds - more. She will need to stand trial for those, so this may end up being a no-win scenario. I imagine Riker was hoping that by showing the Gatherers that Yuta had changed, they could make an appeal for mercy, or perhaps at least a compromise to keep her alive (both HIGHLY unlikely, but if there is a chance, it has to be tried). Or maybe his conscience can't bear the thought of taking her out without giving her a chance at some personal redemption no matter how small.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhatever his motives, they're all moot in the end. By rejecting Riker's pleas and going for the kill, Yuta's fate was sealed. She's a dead girl, no matter how the situation ends. The only question is, by who's hands will she be put to death - a group of barely-civilized ruffians with barbaric impulses, or by the hand of someone who cares for her enough to make her death as swift and painless as possible? Far from Riker's action being brutal and needless, I see it as the opposite. This really was the best ending he could give her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes this make sense or have I overlooked something?"

Use this Wordle answer finder to find the daily Wordle answer before your buddies and show off your skills on social media. What is Wordle? Wordle is a daily puzzle game that allows users to create a colorful picture by combining random letters into words. The user gets 6 tries to guess the daily Wordle word. After each try, you learn if the letters you used are in the daily Wordle answer or not. More than that, a green box not only indicates the presence of the letter but also confirms its position. In other words, each word you try gives you some clues about the letters you have to unscramble in your next move. If the user guesses the word correctly within 6 attempts, the user wins. If the user fails to guess the word within 6 attempts, the word disappears from the screen and the user loses. And now, thanks to the power of social media, the word game has exploded into mainstream culture. Why is Wordle so popular? There's only one puzzle per day, creating a certain level of scarcity and competition as everyone plays the same puzzle. You can challenge your Wordle buddies on Twitter and compete with them to solve the daily puzzle. It's also easy and fun to share your result, as you can post an image of your Wordle showing off your word-solving skills without disclosing the answer. And it's not only a great way to waste time. Wordle is actually an excellent tool for learning English. In fact, the creator of Wordle says he based his creation on the famous Scrabble board game. But unlike Scrabble, Wordle doesn't require any special equipment. All you need is a web browser and a keyboard. And while it may seem silly to spend time playing a word game when you could be reading books, doing homework, or working, Wordle offers a unique opportunity to practice spelling and vocabulary skills. In addition to being a fun way! Tips & Tricks To Win Wordle 1. Carefully pick your first five-letter word To start solving the puzzle, choose a word made of five different letters three of them being vowels. 2. Learn the most popular five-letter words It's best if you learn or keep in handy some 5-letter word lists. 3. Avoid reusing letters that have come before The keyboard at the bottom can help you with that to some extent, but it's better to use a word finder that has this feature. 4. Use a Wordle solver As always, when playing word games, employing an anagram solver or word unscrambler will give you the edge you need to beat your opponents."

I\u2019m already not a fan of mid-century aesthetic OR post-apocalyptic dust bowl worlds and the two combined were just\u2026repellent to me specifically. Like oh look, the already bland design trends of the progressively more minimalist late 40s-to-late-60s but everything is BROKEN and RUSTY! Look at that sign!!! It\u2019s SO RUSTY!!! \n\nThis combined with the lackluster writing and lack of any depth made me literally sigh in relief once I\u2019d choked the whole game down.\n\nI bounced off of FNV a few times just because of my bad experience with 3 and my aforementioned dislike of this specific type of world-building, but man\u2026imagine my surprise once, on my 4th attempted play through, finally managed to push myself to make it to Nipton to find the Legion in action. \n\nHow wildly creative and intriguing. I did *not* expect to see Roman historical roleplayers out in this otherwise somewhat predictable mid-century post-apocalyptic blandscape. The Legion was so unexpected and mysterious to me that it formed a hook that drew me through the rest of the entire game and gave me motivation to see that the REST of the Mojave is also wildly interesting and extremely well-written. \n\nOf course I really wish Obsidian had more time to flesh The Legion out as they had initially intended to, but damn what a cool idea. \n\nThe intrigue of this weird faction, of their alien actions and motivations, of their commitment to *the bit,* of trying to imagine what a society ruled by these people would look like practically really enabled me to open my heart to the rest of New Vegas. \n\nSo yeah. Did not love 3. Thank you FNV for showing me how cool the Fallout universe can be and making me want to play the original. And fuck you, 3, for being so mediocre that you almost deprived me of the great experience of FNV altogether.",

                "body": "I\u2019m in my 20s and I have had POTS since I was a young teenager. I feel as if it\u2019s gotten worse as I\u2019ve aged, especially recently. But I\u2019m having a particular symptom that has me slightly concerned. I\u2019ve tried googling if this is a symptom of POTS, and although there are a feeeeew shared experiences online, lots of us have other conditions so I can\u2019t be sure. I also haven\u2019t been able to find any medical sources.\n\nSo this usually happens right after I stand up. Of course there\u2019s the dizziness, but sometimes I\u2019ll have BURNING muscle pain and weakness in my arms as well as serious shortness of breath. At these times I\u2019m barely able to lift my arms at all, they are so incredibly weak and the burning is so severe.\n\nI want to clarify the type of pain here; it\u2019s not neuropathy or fibromyalgia (I\u2019ve experienced those and this isn\u2019t that). It 100% feels like the type of burning and exhaustion caused by strenuous exercise. It feels like I\u2019ve just done a hundred jumping jacks or something, or I\u2019ve done some rapid weight lifting. You know the point in exercising where the burning just gets too bad, your muscles are too exhausted and they turn to jelly as you gasp for breath? That\u2019s what this is, but it\u2019s after like...getting out of the car and walking to the house, or sitting up from bed to go to the bathroom, or getting up from a chair to grab something out of a cabinet. \n\nI know that muscles burn after exercise for multiple reasons, but that one reason is that your body can\u2019t keep up with pumping oxygenated blood to your extremities, causing lactic acid to build up and cause a burning sensation. \n\nCould this be happening with POTS? Could oxygenated blood be draining from my upper body down to my lower body when I stand, my heart is unable to pump fast and hard enough to sustain blood flow to my arms, and the lack of oxygen is causing exercise-burn and breathlessness? \n\nI saw a post from a woman who had this symptom (as well as POTS) and they were testing her for a disease that causes progressive, worsening muscle weakness over a few short years. This terrified me, and I\u2019m really really hoping this is just a POTS symptom and not something more serious.\n\nDoes this happen to you? Have you ever seen a medical source talking about this? Should I see someone about this, and if so, who? I was diagnosed with POTS at the Mayo Clinic so I can\u2019t exactly go back to the doctor who diagnosed me. Is there a specialist I can see about POTS, and what specialist would that be?\n\nI did see one scant source mention the \u201ccoat hanger pain\u201d, which I have, and it said that this pain is caused by lack of oxygenated blood to the neck and shoulders. But I just can\u2019t find much else on it. \n\nCould this also be worsened by physical de-conditioning? It feels too severe and crippling just to be \u201coh you\u2019re out of shape\u201d. Although I\u2019m pretty sedentary, I\u2019m not overweight at all, so I\u2019m not having to lift excess weight when I lift my arms. \n\nThis is very debilitating and I\u2019m starting to get worried it\u2019s something serious. Sorry for the long post and all the questions, I\u2019m just concerned and desperate for answers here. \n\nThank you \ud83d\udda4"

I VERY rarely actually engage or have any desire to engage in physical sex, but I very much enjoy flirting, teasing and playing games with people. Confusing them about my interest in them, making them wonder if I\u2019m trying to fuck them or not, that kind of shit. \n\nIf I could sum up my entire sexuality in one word, it would have to be \u201ctease\u201d. I even enjoy teasing people I have no interest in, just because I find it exciting. \n\nThis to me feels like an Aquarius thing. Airy, detached, cerebral (rather than overtly physical). I\u2019m sure this love of teasing is aided by my Gemini moon and Libra rising, but it feels like a very Aquarian quality. \n\nWhat do y\u2019all think?"

                "body": "So I just started learning how to pick locks and I'm loving it. I started out of borderline necessity. Our gate had a cheap black Master Lock on it that we couldn't find the key to and it was causing a lot of trouble for us (we tried bolt cutters, making a shim, etc). I purchased one of those cheap Dangerfield kits and some practice locks and after about 30 minutes of practice, I was able to open our gate in a matter of seconds. \n\nNaturally, that was an addictively powerful feeling and so after picking every single lock I could find in the house (aside from door locks in use, I don't wanna fuck those up) and getting bored with my practice locks, I decided to purchase 2 Master Lock #3s as recommended by this sub. \n\nI just got them today and was excited to take a crack at them. I've heard they're very easy with no security pins to worry about, but I'm running into some trouble here.\n\nThe thing is so damn crunchy I can't hear or feel what's going on inside. There's just so much scraping and sometimes, in moving my pick to the next pin, I'll meet so much resistance that I'll have to use some serious force and when I do that my pick slides very deep into the lock and I lose track of where I am. I'm not able to easily glide from pin to pin, it's a real fight.\n\nI've ordered some lock lubricant and I'm hoping that will help ease my way a bit. I've used all different levels of tension. I've watched videos of people picking them, and it's frustrating because in these vidoes I hear clear, affirmative clicks when pins are set but all I get out of mine is crunchy grinding. The way the core seems to be borderline free floating around in the body, wiggling all over the place as I'm trying to pick it is not helpful either.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for a complete noob at this? Thanks!"

At each stop, it's pretty interactive with the person watching. I can't remember much about the stops, but one of them was a giant box of popcorn.

                "body": "I had to go NC with my father finally back in June. It's been the best decision I could have made, though it's come with a terrible cost.\n\nWhat kind of a grandfather calls his youngest granddaughter a \"whigger\", on Facebook in public comments? He called his youngest grandson the same thing. My first ex-wife and mother of my five kids passed away three years ago, and he still called her a \"hog\". Not sure if he's referred to my second ex-wife that way, but I'll be damned if he's going to treat my SO or her daughter in the same way, which I'm sure he eventually would.\n\nEvery call or visit, it was rehashing the same old things that happened 10 years ago, 20 years ago, or even longer. Even as I tried to let go of his reprehensible words and actions in the face of my mom's illnesses, he could simply never let go of his anger about my mistakes and errors over the years. Yet at the same time, he would be angry because I wouldn't contact him or talk to him unless necessary.\n\nFinally, back in June, we were having an argument, and he got into my face, threatening to shoot and kill me. Why? No reason beyond that we were having an argument and I dared to disagree with him. He told me to \"get the fuck out and never set foot in this house again\", and I gladly complied as I did feel genuine fear for my life. This was no loss of control emotional outburst. I saw the look in his eyes. I heard the tone and inflection in his words. I felt the rage and hatred emanating from him. He meant every single word of it.\n\nSadly, going NC with him also meant going NC with my mom. She had been fighting Crohn's and other conditions for some years, and even after his GTFO comment before, he still had the gall to get on my case about not being there for her or contacting her. To do that, I had to go through him, and that was something I refused to do anymore. It was a terrible choice to make, but it had to be made. I couldn't even tell her that on Facebook or in any other way, as he monitored all of her communication.\n\nShe passed away a little over a month ago, and today would have been her 76th birthday. She never chose to speak up against his treatment of me or my kids. I don't know and never will know the reasons for her choices. She never took a side or spoke out against things that were clearly his fault or issue. In doing so, she further enabled him to continue and entrench his behaviors and attitudes.\n\nPerhaps she felt as he did and didn't want to show it. Perhaps she was scared or nervous about \"taking a side\" and speaking out against him. Perhaps he was abusing her all along and I never picked up on it. I don't know, and have accepted that I never will.\n\nHe didn't even contact me to let me know she had died. He instead contacted my daughter - the same one he called a \"whigger\" - and simply said I might want to get in touch with him. He told me months ago that he'd never tell me if anything happened to her or himself, and that's exactly what he did.\n\nHe took over using my mom's Facebook account after her passing, and then unfriended me from it. It wasn't changed to a memorial account. Before I was unfriended, I saw he had posted a couple of times on it about how lonely he was.\n\nHis choices, words, and actions got him where he is now. I said months ago he'd die sad, lonely, bitter, and angry, and I'm sure that's exactly what will happen. He will never know (not that he'd truly care) about the good things in my life and my kids' lives, or in the lives of my SO and her daughter.\n\nI've accepted the responsibility for my choices, words, and actions. He doesn't, and he never will. I know that much now. Does it hurt? Of course it does. But I'll do what I must do - keep going forward and maintain NC with him. Sorry for long post - thanks for reading if you made it to the end."

Blinded by loneliness and depression, I ignored, rationalized, excused, explained, and justified through labyrinth twists of logic and emotion why you were the way you were.\n\nIt took me 11 of those years before I finally woke up and saw things for what they really were by taking off the damned blinders, looking at things objectively about both of us. And it wasn't pretty.\n\nYou learned the lessons from your mother well. Five marriages, and not once did she claim any shared responsibility for their failures. You did the same to me. I'm sure you're still telling people it was all me, and poor innocent you did nothing wrong at all.\n\nI did love you. Did I make mistakes? Sure I did, but I tried for 11 straight years to learn from them, grow, and become a man you could be proud to call your husband...and what did that get me?\n\n1. A trip to KC where you almost certainly fucked someone else. Do you really think I didn't eventually figure out why the greeting when I picked you up at the train station in Chicago was the way it was? \"Glad that train ride was over\", my ass. That was a guilty conscience. It's so obvious now. It's also why you said in the car when leaving Chicago, \"I don't know why I ever left Missouri.\" No, it didn't have anything to do with your dad. It had everything to do with me.\n2. An emotional affair with a man you really wanted to be with from 20-plus years ago, sometimes with you texting and talking to him while I was there in the apartment. I read the messages and had screenshots of them, going all the way back to January 2020. You leaned on everyone and anyone except me, the one person that was there for you all along.\n3. 11 years of a dead bedroom where I could count on two hands the amount of times we actually had sex, or even just cuddled or touched. Dating, you were all about cuddling, snuggling, touching, and sex, along with the emotional and intellectual connection. You pretended to be who you thought I wanted. We got engaged, that came to a screeching halt and the real you appeared. Sending a nude to an ex-boyfriend as \"closure for the relationship\" right after we got engaged? How stupid I was to believe that...that should have been the point I ran like hell and never looked back.\n4. For years on end, you froze me out, ignored me, kept your head buried in the phone, tablet, or computer, and used me for what you truly wanted - a caretaker, gofer, butler, wallet, errand boy, and so on. You wanted a roommate, not a husband, and I foolishly obliged in the vain hope that maybe you'd change a bit, care about my needs and wants, and try to reciprocate. \"I've got someone to take care of me.\" Yes, you meant it exactly that way.\n5. You gave me a hall pass to fuck someone else...the woman I've been close friends with for 36 years now. The one you hooked up your emotional affair partner with, claiming it was done to end the EA...but even if true, it's clear now it was done to end it without actually having to accept responsibility for your part in it. I feel your main goal was to get him closer to you and eventually make some kind of move and profess your love and feeling of \"safety\" with him, like you did in the messages you sent.\n6. After I'd read the messages and knew what had been said, I gave you a chance to come clean and be honest. You lied right to my face, over and over again. It wasn't done out of some kind of mental distress - it was calculated, deliberate, and intentional. It proved that your word was worthless where I was concerned.\n7. I was surprised you kept your word and gave me your Facebook history. I read it all. I gave you mine as a show of good faith, even as you told me you weren't going to read it...which I know now was because you didn't give a damn about me beyond what I could do for you. You were toying with the idea of an affair years before the KC trip happened - that much became clear from your own words. I challenged you to find anything in my history, Facebook or otherwise, that showed anything like that on my part. You declined to do so because you knew there wasn't any and never had been.\n\nYou gaslighted and DARVOed me (denied, attacked, reversed victim order) mercilessly our entire marriage, but just subtly enough that if I called it out, I looked like the bad guy. You emotionally abused me and used me solely for your own ends, falling back into the victim role whenever I got too close to the truth you so desperately tried to conceal.\n\nYes, you were sexually abused growing up...I know it now (never mind how or from whom) along with a lot of other things I didn't know back then. I'll simply say that until you can finally be honest with yourself about what happened and who did it to you, you'll just end up repeating the cycle we had with someone else.\n\nI don't hate you. I don't love you, either. I simply hope that you find some kind of peace and joy in life, whether with someone else or alone. Bon voyage."

I doubt it, and I'll check in game if and when I have time to do so, but figured it wouldn't hurt to ask here first. Thanks!"

I mean the sides and even the bottom of one kit are littered with pins and adolescent-sized shrooms.\n\nI'm now trying to figure out some solutions but I'm a bit stumped. I thought of maybe cutting the plastic boxes vertically on the corners so I can just pull back and open the walls of the boxes to make space for growing. I would leave enough height to the walls on the bottom so the water doesn't get inside. One friend also mentioned he once just took the whole cake out of the box and just had it directly in the bag.\n\nWould love some advice to save my soul from spending again more than an hour picking from under the damn cake while having to hold each of its sides up with a spatula. Is there any way I can do a mod on the cakes / boxes so I can easily harvest next flushes?\n\nCheers and thanks very much for your time!"

Thanks to anyone reading this for the patience <3 I highly appreciate it as this is a very frustrating experience to say the least.  \n\n\nAs general info - I am an EU citizen coming from Romania and have already worked in Germany for 2 years and 2 months.\n\nAbout getting Arbeitslosengeld - what EXACTLY must one do to start getting the benefits?\n\nI thought registering as Arbeitslos + Job Seeking at Agentur fur Arbeit would mean I would get registered for benefits also. I actually tried to register for benefits online (two months ago, after registering in due time as Job Seeking and Unemployed) but the online form said there is already a registration in process on my profile for that date!!! (this was a couple of months ago - the date of my unemployment would be 01.03.2022).\n\nNow that I noticed the benefits aren't coming in, I asked my advisor and he said he doesn't have anything to do with this and that I should call to 0800 4 5555 00. I am quite confused since this is a number for Agentur fur Arbeit?!?!?!?! Why can't he advise me what to do?!\n\nI went to my AfA profile again and now I can register for benefits on the date when it was previously unavailable! I registered and now I'm confused as to what's the next part of the process? The site says now that my application was completed but not yet sent?! But with no option to actually send it?!\n\nA document called Arbeitsbescheinigung is to be filled in by my past employer. Will this complete my submission and send it?\n\nAlso, will I now get my benefits retroactively or did I just miss a couple months of Arbeitslosengeld?!"

For the moment I created a small survey of 10 questions that can be answered with a simple Yes/No or optionally filled in with a full answer. The data will be used solely in further development of the icons featured in the survey and the survey submissions are anonymous. There is no commercial interest in this endeavour.\n\nIt would be a great help and highly appreciated if you find a short time to answer my survey found at this link:  \n\n\n[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/C9XY8N3](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/C9XY8N3)\n\n  \n Thank you for your time!"

But I feel like this has to be said. \n\nI was picked up by the right during the height of gamergate. In the beginning, it was just to laugh at the cringe because people making an unhinged ass of themselves will never get old. I did however feel there must be some legit grievance the left and feminists must have. So, occasionally, I tried to find some understanding. Unfortunately, I always seemed to pick the worst people to reply to and ask. Granted, I wasn't very tactful in my approach (because duh, I didn't know jack shit) but I WAS genuinely trying to learn. The misandry, anti-white racism, and accusing me of \"Mansplaining\" whenever I tried inputting what I saw was too much. I concluded the left to be utterly insane and unable to have a nuanced discussion.\n\nWas it any wonder that compared to the people I came across on the \"left\", the right *seemed* sane? I was able to talk with them and have calm and semi-rational responses. Obviously, we all know it was all part of the schtick to lure me in further and when armed with better information their arguments fall apart. None the less, it was effective, and **STILL** is to those who find themselves where I once was. I wasn't on the right because of some ingrained malice, but because I was misinformed and mislead by the right while being ostracized by the left. \n\nThere are absolutely PLENTY of irredeemable sexist racist shitheads who have no hope of being better. That's still no reason to abandon those who just need someone to reach out to them in understanding and help them grow. It's disgusting to see the left I saw back then still alive and well after all these years. And as long is this behavior remains prevalent, abandoned young men will continue to fall for the fascist cause."

                "body": "&#x200B;\n\n[Buzzly Logo](https://preview.redd.it/gn6x1hbsetn81.png?width=226&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9bb7c35caea435caf59ccb17fece03937e77a2c3)\n\nSo, basically there was this new art website called Buzzly.art, branded as made by and for artists. It\u2019s effectively a clone of 2014 Deviantart, and was/still is in beta currently, but it started to pick up quite fast over time. Plenty of people who wanted new, more active gallery-type sites to post their art on began migrating. However, roughly in late January or early February the site had closed off registration indefinitely.\n\n# Light drama\n\nThings were slightly shaky in the beginning, and there were some decisions made and things done that caused some drama. The first somewhat well known one was when a [user had made a slightly suggestive joke about someone\u2019s artwork, and staff had basically told them that was inappropriate.](https://www.deviantart.com/the-mind-controller/journal/What-Happened-At-Buzzly-Art-898804015) To most people this seemed strange and like an overstep on staff\u2019s part. Others had also reported that they had been given strikes over seemingly trivial things, but for the most part this was not a large issue for everyone, more-so those who had migrated from other websites. There were apparently more instances like this that had happened, but none really stood out as noteworthy.\n\nAnother one later on was staff\u2019s decision to [ban content involved incest](https://buzzly.art/news/clearing-the-air), which apparently [was a problem earlier on](https://imgur.com/a/aGSstFx). This caused multiple people with varying opinions to chime in. Supposedly, the [official discord got nuked](https://imgur.com/a/4CSLrg6) sometime after this. Staff had claimed it was so that they could focus on the site more, however some people believed it was to erase backlash. There were also some other things brought up, like how staff was slow to ban nazi imagery posted on the site, as well as one of the devs being supportive of crypto/nfts, but none of this was yet cause of any actual uproar among community members.\n\n# Where shit hit the fan\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwhobo060tn81.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=43a3342e70c6723bc02b33418540a6591cea60e7\n\nOn March 14, one of the devs put out a poll about a 'community moral compass.' The options on the poll were very [strangely worded](https://twitter.com/buzzlyarts/status/1503511357383077889?s=20&t=9vsUt5GwgKgNGU3QjIPpHg), and some felt that they had been phrased in such a manner in order to elicit a reaction, which they did. Because of this, naturally, a lot of people were left [confused and pissed off](https://imgur.com/a/66nJn0l). The members would attempt to confront the staff members about this, however most seemed hesitant to reply immediately.\n\nYou can view the poll results [here.](https://twitter.com/buzzlyarts/status/1503516879016497152?s=20&t=9vsUt5GwgKgNGU3QjIPpHg)\n\nA staff member would then rush to twitter and tweet about the poll, promising a google doc on the matter later on.\n\n[https://twitter.com/nymlyz/status/1503657418835832835](https://twitter.com/nymlyz/status/1503657418835832835)\n\n>*First and foremost, I'm sorry to anyone who had to read that poll, or worse, felt pressured to vote one way or another by confusing questions. Nobody in staff except Chris(ChStark), and Red(RedArcanine) chose these questions to be published.*  \n>  \n>*I will make a bigger, more detailed post later, likely through a google document to organize it better. In short, i'm probably quitting since they are now currently ignoring the entire staff. Fun times over at Buzzly*\n\nAs they promised, the same staff member would then post a statement inside a google document on twitter about the whole situation, and an explanation on why the poll was the way it was.\n\n[https://twitter.com/nymlyz/status/1503885190636089344?cxt=HHwWgMCtrZ3n794pAAAA](https://twitter.com/nymlyz/status/1503885190636089344?cxt=HHwWgMCtrZ3n794pAAAA)\n\n>*Speaking out against what has transpired the past 24 hours at Buzzly Art. Here is a document detailing staff experience, leading up to our moderation powers being revoked.*\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/10LTUMEJ\\_iWpzLlAOMXgPOhVLFflVzmD5YkmZSwqGSsM/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10LTUMEJ_iWpzLlAOMXgPOhVLFflVzmD5YkmZSwqGSsM/edit)\n\nSo, if what we're told is true, two of the staff members, known as Chris and Pokemutt(RedArcanine) were the ones to blame, though majority of people put emphasis on Chris for the poll. Effectively, Chris had thrown away any criticism other staff members had given to the poll he made and posted it anyway, for some reason.\n\n[The Nym user even tried calling out Chris on the websites official twitter account](https://imgur.com/a/7XVYJEB).\n\nTo add insult to injury, some people dug up more info about Pokemutt's past, and found details which had [suggested that Pokemutt was a pedophile](https://mobile.twitter.com/CytricAcidArt/status/1503887749480435722). Also, sometime earlier today or yesterday, Pokemutt would have his mod perms stripped and account removed, as well as nuking his twitter and DeviantArt account. [Three other staff members would quit, but would have their accounts still listed as developers.](https://twitter.com/nymlyz/status/1503978715721699329?cxt=HHwWgsC4xY2rmt8pAAAA)\n\nThough, later on Nym's account would dissappear.\n\n[Several screenshots would also be leaked](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ViMihqI8aXjLldy4a9SDfv0_Aa5uAXaQ).\n\nThis resulted in both Chris and Pokemutt's pages (before he left) to be spammed with angry comments, copypastas, and general bullshittery. People also began [leaving en masse](https://imgur.com/a/zDLVrwP), and [would spam the main page with memes, statements and farewells.](https://imgur.com/a/VzoudzF) As well as, fair warning, porn and gore. They'd also post images advising others to delete or replace their artwork files with different images, so that they could not be minted as NFTs. It is rare right now to find an actual art piece among the spam.\n\n[Evidence that Chris was deleting accounts for voting on the polls would be screen capped and posted to twitter](https://twitter.com/BuzzlyArt/status/1505044885497335822?s=20&t=4yUHTNFwCuuVDO_OIIcDZA).\n\nIt really is hard trying to figure out what motive Chris has for shitting the website up, but from what some have speculated, he did so for purposes of promoting crypto/NFTs, which as mentioned earlier is something he supports (though really this is just a rumor), as well as filtering out users he didn't want by using the poll.\n\nThe situation is ongoing, so I'm not sure what'll happen next or how the remaining staff will do damage control, but from what I can see right now the website is done for.\n\n**TL;DR New-ish seemingly promising art site gets launched, people get distrustful due to repetetive sketchy behavior of certain staff members, all hell breaks loose when terribly written poll gets put out and people leave the site due to being fed up about staff unprofessionalism.**"

                "created_utc": 1675575407.0,
                "body": "I am confused about my future and whether I want to go to law school or if I am meant for something else. I have dreamt of attending law school for a while now; however, I am questioning whether it's what I want. And if not, I don't know what I want to do with my life.\n\nFor background information, I am currently a 21-year-old junior double majoring in Political Science and Philosophy, with minors in English and History. I have a 3.15 GPA and am at a top-100 university. I recently took the LSAT and got a score in the 140s. I am planning to retake it, but before I spend money on a tutoring service, I am wondering if this is what I truly want. My oldest sister recently graduated from law school and is currently a prosecutor. While watching her law school experience, I wasn't deterred, and am still not \u2013 just questioning it.\n\nAlthough, I am not the only one questioning becoming an attorney and my future goals, but my parents are too. Their questions aren't unwarranted, because I have changed my career goals numerous times; but they are making me spiral even more. I am known for trying something to only give it up later. I jump from one thing to the next often; something will catch my eye, and I will idealize/romanticize it for months to only drop it for something else.\n\nI have changed my majors several times; hence their previous hesitations about my career goals. I went into college as an English major wanting to be an author \u2013 still do; but realized it is impossible to become one. Then in the spring semester of freshman year, I switched to being a psychology major thinking I wanted to be a therapist. Took a few classes, then did some more research and decided I did not want to be a therapist. The summer after my freshman year, I switched to art history. I watched a movie about an art curator and romanticized the career. I registered for an art history course but dropped it before the semester started. Fall of my sophomore year, I was an economics major for a semester, and took a few classes; I thought I wanted to be a financial planner, but then I decided against it. Finally, I landed on my current majors and minors, as I always had the idea of being a lawyer in the back of my mind and thought these would be beneficial.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy interests are pretty spread out; although, only at the surface level. My main interest is political theory. I enjoy reading about the different forms of government, justice, morals, history of government, etc. When I *lecture* my family about what I have learned, I get visibly excited.\n\nI am also interested in law, mostly constitutional law. I enjoy learning about the history of the constitution, jurisprudence, and reading supreme court cases. I am currently writing my junior thesis, about comparing the different judicial interpretation methods; living constitutionalism vs originalism.\n\nHistory and classical studies are also interesting. I enjoy learning about the past and culture/mythology of the Greco-Roman world, and how they influenced our lives. This is why I am surprised I stopped being an art history major quickly because I do like history and art.\n\nI also enjoy writing and reading poetry and fiction. I aspire to be an author, however, it's almost impossible to achieve, so I need to find another career. These are my main interests, which as you can see, don't have much practical application to any career. Which is why I am utterly confused about what I want to do with my life after I graduate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am thinking about attending law school for various reasons. As mentioned I am interested in constitutional law and am interested in the idea of learning more in law school. Although, I was told that there are no jobs in constitutional law unless I could make a living as an amicus curiae. I enjoy arguing, and what career field allows that more than law? I need an indoor career with autonomy and independence, which I feel being a lawyer allows. I hope to make six figures. I like the idea of opening a practice with my sister and working together. Listening about her job and what she does seems interesting. I have and am enjoying all of my pre-law classes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am questioning becoming an attorney for the following reasons. I am a junior and am already dealing with burnout. So, I am questioning if I could do another three years of school. A superficial reason I am questioning being a lawyer is that I can't see myself wearing a suit every day. Yes, I know this isn't important, but when I see myself in a career I am wearing sweaters and trousers, not a suit. I don't have a clear idea of the type of law I would practice. I have thought about becoming a law professor, as it would allow me everything I hope for in a career; however, I would need to attend a top 10 law school which is impossible. Speaking of which, I don't think I will get into a good law school with my GPA/LSAT. Finally, I am not 100% sure I want to be a lawyer. Like how are you supposed to know what you want to do with your life? Maybe it's my bpd and having no sense of self.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am looking for any advice regarding law school or any other career. Re-reading this it seems I wrote it mainly to get it off my chest, but I appreciate any advice. I apologize for this being long, and a bit rambly. I didn't know where to post this, but if this does not belong here I will delete it."

I took a break from the idea to let it sit. Though I enjoyed it so much, I had to start writing and thinking about it again. However, when I came back to it, I realized it's a book that is already written. A story about a half-human-half-angel race; that protects the world from demons -- a book series I have read many times and enjoyed. So, I guess when I thought I was *coming up* with an original idea, I remembered the said book and wrote everything the same; but the exact words or characters - even though they are similar.\n\nI guess onto the next idea. One that will, again, likely be similar to another book I have read \u2013 as that keeps happening.\n\nHow do y\u2019all come up with original ideas? I try to get inspiration from things I see or read - clearly - yet I can't come up with anything original. It seems all I am destined to write is fan fiction."

                "body": "Hi, so I don't know if this is the correct place to put this, but I am currently beating up on myself over a social situation that happened this week. For some more information, I am a 21-year-old male in my junior year of university. I have joined a club this year where I have gotten to at least know a few people on a *hello* level; and, this hasn't been something I have had for the past two-three years. I have not known anyone, talked to anyone, or had a friend or acquaintance that isn't a family member. This is probably because my personality is extra/eccentric, and I come on too strong.\n\nAnyway, the problem I am currently worried about is one person in my club - who is nice - said hi to me when they saw me around campus; however, I didn't hear or see them. Later, after one of our club meetings, they came up to me and said they saw me and said hi, and that I ignored them. This made me feel horrible and anxious. So\u2026  I said, \u201csorry\u2026 I live in my own little world and don't pay attention to the external world\u201d which is probably the worst thing I could have said. In return, they said, \u201cit's okay.\u201d \n\nNow, I am wondering when they said \u201cit's okay\u201d is it actually fine, and if they see me again on campus, or I see them, I could say hi, and they won't ignore me in return. Or, was this \u201cit's okay\u201d a form of polite social response, and actually they think I am the worst person in the world? I am mainly worried because they are nice \u2013 I thought we could be acquaintances eventually; now, I feel I ruined every chance of that. \n\nAs mentioned, I have not known many people in the past. So, if someone says my name or says hi around me, I 100% know they weren't talking to me. Because of this, having people say hi to me this year has been something I have to adjust to. Also, maybe this might make things a little better; this isn't the first time this person and I have spoken outside of the club, a few weeks ago, I saw them at the dining hall and said hi and we talked for a little while, so it's not that I actively ignored them.\n\nI know this isn't a lot of information to go off of, but I know nothing about being social. I literally cannot hold a conversation with someone my age. I am only able to speak with my family well. So, I thought I would ask here to get outsiders' opinions."

I first decided to major in political science after changing it three times, because I thought it would be good for getting into law school. Though, I am concerned that if law school doesn't work out or isn't possible, I won't have other career options. Although, the prospects of law school were a major reason for majoring in political science I am also interested in political theory. Besides politics and academia, I can't think of other careers for political science majors. I have realized recently I am no longer interested in politics after helping on a local campaign and during an internship for a congresswoman this summer. I have thought about academia and becoming a political theory professor, but I am worried that there are no professor roles available, although the BLS says there are good career prospects - a 12% increase. So, I am wondering, what are some possible careers for political science majors? As I am a junior, I don't have time - and because of parental pressure - to change my major."

I am trying to research the topic as much as I can beyond 'Play with it and see what works for you' (I understand that this is the ultimate answer though lol). I am currently using a Crafty+ (using the pods that come with it) to vape a 20:1 strain.  Everything I see suggests around 300mg - 600mg to treat anxiety. It's just hard to get an idea for how many hits/how long on a draw that translates to. I'm also curious about how often to dose - That is to say that I've read multiple studies that suggest long term consistent use produces the best results, but from what I've gathered, CBD effects are good for about 2 hours when taken via dry herb vape. Is the vape essentially the 'break glass in case of emergency' method when compared to edibles? If not, how often should I be dosing? Thanks for any help - I know it's kind of a loaded question for Reddit haha"

                "body": "So I know the default answer to this title is to count my blessings, but I do have a little bit of an issue with my low tolerance. I am a medical patient and use cannabis to treat a nasty little anxiety disorder. Currently, I am using a dry Herb vape (Crafty+) smoking Pink Runtz (~15% thca) and my normal dose after a couple cigar puffs to get the vapor going is about a 3-4 second hit one time. This gets me comfortably high - quiets the anxiety and leaves me more or less functional (no driving etc obviously). The issue is, there are so many strains that are supposed to be great for anxiety that are barred from me at the moment. My budtender recently got me to try Blue Cheese (~24% thca) and it just floors me. It\u2019s a 50/50 if it\u2019s going to cause an anxiety attack or make me extremely nice and mellow. My tolerance just makes it hard because it\u2019s hard to find anything under 20% where I live. I also keep a high cbd strain on hand (~18% cbd, 1% thc) for high anxiety days, and to help sand down the edges when I do have an anxiety attack - and it helps a lot. Any insight/recommendations are appreciated. \n\np.s. I\u2019ve been smoking sparsely for the past 5ish months (3 times a week at most, probably) and recently have been smoking every day over this past week (around 3 \u201csessions\u201d a day, at least an hour between each session) in an attempt to raise my tolerance."

                "body": "Well, I couldn't have asked for things to go much smoother! BPD mother didn't come to the wake. I didn't make eye contact with her at the funeral, graveside, or luncheon and made sure to stick by people I felt comfortable with while staying aware of where she was. My one error was not making sure it wasn't her in the restroom with me. It was her. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But again, I didn't make eye contact and just washed my hands and left.\n\nThe funeral was really good. My grandmother was an amazing person. I got to see her home one last time and spend some quality time with my dad and stepmom. I even got to tell my dying grandfather I love him and hold his hand awhile. He was so glad so much of the family had come, even though he was exhausted by all the visitors.\n\nI didn't escape toxic mothers completely though. My aunt mostly ignored me until just before the funeral when she came over to hug me and tell me how much she appreciated me coming (I live across the country). I was a bit confused, until she said, \"Unlike my rotten children.\" It wasn't even a joke or sarcasm. She straight up called her children rotten. I'm not surprised they didn't want to come and be there with her. At least one of them has cut her out, and I sure don't blame them.\n\nAnyway, anticipation was way worse than the event! So many people were there who loved my grandmother. The only reason it wasn't standing-room-only is because she outlived so many people. Glad I had her positive influence in my life."

                "body": "My parents have been divorced for over 30 years. I have never heard my mother say anything good about any member of my father's family. The only reason I can think she is going is to get some attention and drama.\n\nI was going to go and remember my grandmother, the most consistent, competent, stable, capable, unjudgmental person in my entire life. I was going to say goodbye to the house she lived in for 70 years and the town I spent some happy childhood times in. I was going to bond with my dad and extended family and let the good memories wash over me. I was going to enjoy listening to other people's stories about my amazing grandmother.\n\nI was already apprehensive about the trip. I'm flying across the country all by myself while my husband stays with the kids. I was a bit worried about seeing my enabling siblings, but I had good plans on how to deal with their inappropriate behavior. I was ready to go back to the epicenter of the high-demand religion I grew up in and escaped from only recently, and I thought I'd be alright just letting all that religious stuff flow around me and observe it as a bystander. I think I could have done all of that and had a really positive trip.\n\nNow my BPD mother is going. I've been NC for at least three years, VVLC for a few years before that. I haven't seen her in 9 years. I finally got to a place in my life where my stress measurements *almost* fell below the \"50% chance for serious illness in the next year\" point.\n\nNow, instead of going and appreciating the life of my grandmother and the company of the mostly mentally healthy side of my family, I have to focus on protecting myself. My father will let her come because he feels pity for her and her isolated life. I only pushed against it once with him because I don't want to make a problem when his (good) mother has just died. But I'm frustrated that once again there is pity and accommodation made for the abuser, and no one thinks maybe the abused needs some of that. It's not fair.\n\nI'm going to be spending my week trying to gray rock instead of allowing myself to grieve. I'm going to have to hold boundaries with my mother and other family members who think I'm in the wrong to cut off contact. And I'm going to be all alone. I have cried more since I got this news than I did about my grandmother dying (she lived a long life and we've been anticipating this for a while). Not just crying, but screaming into the void, pounding my fists into the bed and slightly more gently into the wall, and generally feeling trapped and hopeless. I came so far with therapy, but only as long as I don't have to be around her.\n\nI hope my plans are enough to keep me from breaking down while I'm there. I'm going to work hard to get enough sleep, make sure I've got my anti-anxiety medication with me, review gray-rocking techniques and maybe role-play them with my husband. I have my own hotel reserved and my own car rental, so I will have a means of escape. I shouldn't have to though. I shouldn't have to.\n\nIf only my mother had died first."

Di pa ako ready na mawala kayo, 23 pa lang ako... 20k lang sinasahod ko, di ko pa kayo kayang ilipad aa ibang bansa para makapasyal nang maexperience natin to kahit minsan. \n\nTangina lang...\n\nBakit ganon.\nBakit ang ikli. \nBakit... ang hirap."

I never really clicked with anybody the way that I click with these people. Whenever we're hanging out, there's never silence & I never want to stop talking nor leave. We never stop texting either. It's like the more time I spend with them, the better I feel. \n\nI always thought I was an introvert because I was always so drained after hanging out with whatever friend I had. I would need *weeks* to recover. \n\nPerhaps I'm mistaken & this is just how friendships are supposed to be, but I'd have no idea so I thought I'd post here & see what you guys think."

You have their attention and their trust so then why r u scared? Me for example, I have had a ton of crushes and only 1 was on a friend. Also, they are YOUR CLOSEST FRIEND so they shouldn\u2019t end any relationship. If they do, they are not a good friend at all. Alr peace"

I started my fantasizing while I would study, and used it to keep me focused. I did great in college and medical school. I\u2019d let my mind wander about LO when I needed to sit at my books then I\u2019d time myself for my focus tasks. This also kept me away from college and dating and everything that goes with it. People called me a nerd and stuff, probably true, but in my head I belonged only to my LO and that kept me away from wasting time and doing well in school. I also want to say that religiously I don\u2019t believe in sex before marriage so this also helped me stick to that goal. After 5-6 years, limerence faded when I met a guy in my class and we later got engaged. I did have limerence for him during that relationship. Eventually, It didn\u2019t work out and then used this second limerence into my career as a neurologist. \n\nAnyway, I wanted to share that if you were a nerdy limerent like me, it can help with your school and career, keep you away from drugs and alcohol (since it\u2019s supposed to be an addiction itself?) and can keep you either monogamous if that\u2019s what you believe in."

I waited two weeks to go in, did the first pass, took all my notes, and made a pretty in-depth plan of attack for developnental editing.\n\nMy writer brain is definitely being defiant though? I don't know if it's normal for the first time doing serious revision or if I didn't wait long enough to put the distance between myself and the first draft. I didn't feel the resistance when I took notes during the first pass though. I was exhilarated being able to pick out what wasn't working and how I could fix things. After weeks of researching various methods and pulling together what I figured would work for me personally.\n\nIt's so weird though. Not sure if this is laziness or just...learning how to revise? \n\nMost scenes just need better goals, motivation, and conflict.\n\nBut other issues, for example - there are three characters:\n\nCharacter A - one of the main protagonists\n\nCharacter B - supporting character\n\nCharacter C - friend of A and B, but acts as an antagonist\n\nI decided that Character B wasn't really serving the story, so I removed him/merged parts of him into A and C. And while it tightens things up and strengthens the characters and conflict, I'm just finding it really grueling to do a lot at once. I saved a copy of that first draft, and yet still I have this knee-jerk \"UGHH\" feeling when I go through to make the changes in draft two. It's also hard to resist line edits. I know it's foolish to do them before getting feedback on draft two with the developmental edit. I just feel bad for the prose, and that this is what I'll end up sharing with Critique Partners or Beta Readers.\n\nAnyway, anyone have any words of wisdom? Do I just need to set a daily goal and marathon through like I did for the first draft? It's my first time diving into revisions. The planning stage was so fun. But now it's like... suddenly really hard! What the heck??\n\nQuestions for others with revision experience:\n\nIs this normal? Do revisions get easier?\nWhat's your typical timeframe for developmental editing?\nWhich draft do you share with CPs or beta readers? How concerned are you about prose at that point?\n\nThanks!"

So, I was a little stressed out this morning when DD2 (1.5 y.o.) kept crying while I set her down to get myself and DD1 ready. She was hungry, she was teething, she wanted Mommy, I get it. :( But then there's also the routine of DD1 (4 y.o.) dragging her feet, getting distracted, and asking me questions a mile a minute. I dunno about y'all but I forget wtf I'm doing when someone keeps asking me shit. Long story short, I was pretty crabby this morning.\n\nWell, I manage to get them fed (even though DD2 gets breakfast at daycare, I give her a lil pre-breakfast snack since DD1 has to eat before preschool) and ready to go. We're just about out the door when DD1 exclaims she has to go potty. I'm a little frustrated, but I open the door for her and urge her not to dillydally because it's gonna take me extra time to drive what with the snowy roads. Ofc she dawdles and forgets to wash her hands and as I'm urging her to quickly wash her hands, she says something that I'm pretty sure was \"you're an ugly person\".\n\nKID, I DON'T NEED THAT SHIT FROM YOU EARLY IN THE MORNING. YOU'RE LUCKY I HAD MY COFFEE AND THAT YOU QUICKLY APOLOGIZED CAUSE JFC THAT WAS RUDE. Then she claimed she didn't say *I* was, that she said *someone* was and she's 4 and fucking backtracks/lies when she knows she's in trouble and GODDAMN I'M UNDERAPPRECIATED AS IT IS, I DON'T NEED SOME CUTE LIL GOBLIN MAKIN ME FEEL WORSE WTF, JUST FUCKING WASH YOUR HANDS AND GET IN THE CAR, I DON'T WANNA DRIVE OR WORK OR DO ANYTHING, and I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT YOUR SASS RN.\n\nI just... between my ears and nerves literally hurting from DD2's crying and my patience frayed thin by DD1's ridiculousness, I WANT to be laid back and fun and just roll with the punches...\n\nBUT IT IS SO FUCKING HARD. And I understand DD1 doesn't get why I'm crabby sometimes but when DH sees me short-fused and makes a comment, it's like\n\n...well \n\nGee-\n\nMaybe-\n\nAND I'M JUST BLOWIN SOME IDEAS OUTTA MY ASS HERE PERHAPS, BUT...\n\nMAYBE IF I HAD A LITTLE MORE FUCKING HELP, I WOULDN'T BE SO BURNT OUT AND SNAPPING AT EVERYBODY IN THE MORNING, GOD.

I have to learn to ignore the mess. I have to learn that I can't change others. I can only manage what's in my control, and I have to stop stressing out about the state of the house. I miss my old apartment though and how much more manageable keeping it clean was. I think it'd be easier to keep up even with two small kids if I didn't have a manchild here as well. Not that I could afford a divorce lol. And the kicker is, I don't think I feel repulsed enough to separate. There is still love for him as a person.

I'm catching a cold (fingers crossed) or something. The two of them have recovered from mild sicknesses of their own, and I guess I caught it. Anyway my throat really hurts and I told DD several times like, Mommy doesn't feel good so she's not up for talking too much right now, sorry. She doesn't fucking remember this though because #4yearolds lmao I felt so bad, like my options are to respond and suffer, ignore her and hurt her, or snap at her and suffer/hurt her. GUESS WHICH BRILLIANT OPTION I CHOSE. \n\nYeah, I got snippy and I'm just 100% over being the GRUMPY parent in her life. I want to just be fun and get all the good moments like her Dad. It's not fucking fair, bromos. Plus underneath my attempt to brush it off and forgive myself, I can't help but feel she deserves so much better. She deserves a mom with the patience of a saint who will just self-sacrifice every damn time. The thing this morning is a small example. The broader picture is I'm constantly tested, and it just seems like I pick the wrong option more often than not because I'm just burning out. Meanwhile DH criticizes me when he sees this, and I agree with him but wish he would see beyond the surface and take some accountability.\n\nOfc the only person in control of my actions is myself... so... I guess I'll TRY to do better. But it is so damn hard. I'm handling bills, kids, the cat, my FT job, maintenance, chores, etc. DH does the bare minimum and expects to have his ass kissed. Then he wonders why I'm not looking to have sex or to spend every waking moment with everyone on the days he's home.\n\n\ud83d\ude14 Thanks for reading. Mostly I guess this is a rant but I'll take any support or wisdom. Sometimes I don't feel good enough. Like I'm magically supposed to be doing better, trying harder. I dunno.

I don't think the song was  very old. \n\nAbout the band :\n\nI'm pretty sure it was by some sort of symphonic metal band, or goth metal. I wasn't a huge fan of this band, I only knew this one song. The singer was female. It was at the time when Nightwish and Evanescence were popular. The band was NOT Leaves' Eyes, as I know that band very well. \n\nAbout the song :\n\nThe song was very slow and melodic, no loud guitar, and no drums or bass. It might have been just a regular guitar or smooth electric guitar, or even just piano. It was slow and depressing. The singer's voice was beautiful and was the most important feature of this song. \n\nThe song was certainly about falling for someone and them not loving you back, or losing someone you love and not having them back, because I listened to this song after relationship that started and ended within months because it was one sided. \n\nI don't recall any lyrics. I just remember that the band name, or the song title had something to do with autumn, fall or leaves.\n\nLet me know if you have ideas."

He used the skill to cover for this and Nereshal being privy to these typa things would know how corrupt/determined the BK actually is and fearing that corruption would put his own life in jeopardy ingrained that code into his head in case of a time paradox. Going further into this, maybe Silvenia\u2019s home was this village and what originally opened her heart to the demon\u2019s plight and the BK knowing this, blamed it on her and turned her people against her which then pushed her into the mindset she has now. Only thing i\u2019m wondering is whether or not she was known as the Death of Magic before or after this because if it was before that kinda throws a chink into the whole Silvenia Origin Story part of the theory. the time stealing theory i saw is cool too so if i\u2019m right, that might\u2019ve been the way they wiped them out."

(boost technologies, power management, security and reliability features, etc.)\n* What other software will I need to install for my CPU besides what AHS already covers?\n* My laptop's BIOS should have some power settings just in case I want to tinker with them. Will TLP, Powertop, etc. be redundant in that case, or will I need to install desktop software to ensure my CPU saves power when necessary?\n* (Side note) I've had experience with Ubuntu MATE and Lubuntu. How easily should I be able to get used to this distro, given that it's Debian-based and will come with XFCE?\n\nThanks in advance."

Depending on the line deliveries, it can come of as creepy and covertly demanding, but also a little nervous.\n\nHere are some bits of Modeus' fan dubs:\n\n[https://youtu.be/MgrrB2Tdh-M?t=25](https://youtu.be/MgrrB2Tdh-M?t=25)\n\n[https://youtu.be/MgrrB2Tdh-M?t=340](https://youtu.be/MgrrB2Tdh-M?t=340)\n\n[https://youtu.be/MppAeU-rnjk](https://youtu.be/MppAeU-rnjk)\n\nAnd here are some of DeLisle's voiceovers:\n\n[https://youtu.be/a91o5JTTClk](https://youtu.be/a91o5JTTClk)\n\n[https://youtu.be/EVGe06ifeqo](https://youtu.be/EVGe06ifeqo)\n\nWhat do you all think?

Is this a subtle foreshadowing of Omori removing Basil from Sunny\u2019s subconscious? Is this a similar case to Aubrey, where Sunny always wished he was closer to Kel in the RW, and thus projects that desire onto his HS variant? \n\nI never interpreted it this way on my initial play through, but does Sunny outright resent Basil for his involvement in The Truth? It seems a bit targeted to blatantly replace his status of \u201cbest friend\u201d in Headspace with Kel, when it seemed obvious by the Memory Lane sequences that Sunny and Basil were closer.\n\nThoughts?"

Now, given that stacking them have no diminishing return in fact, meaning flat armor will always give same value no matter how much of it you have. Now of course if you have too much armor, extra HP will be more valuable then extra armor (will give more effective HP). Therefore Lethality should work the same way as armor. No matter how much armor someone has, lethality will always give same value. Just as you add flat +10 armor, lethality reduces flat -10 armor for example. So why is there a common understanding that when the enemy team has a lot of armor, lethality should be bad? Of course % armor penetration will most likely be more valuable in such a case because of high numbers, but I am writing about lethality here only. Because people will build lethality when enemy has low armor. I have a feeling I am wrong in my thinking and would ask of you kindly to show me where and how. I think I am wrong somewhere in the lines of \"If enemy has more HP then Armor, Armor gives them more value. Therefore just as well in that case Lethality gives you more value. And if enemy has more Armor then HP, then HP should give them more value, therefore Lethality gives you less value.\" It does seem to make sense, although I feel as though Lethality should always give some amount of flat value, it is only the context that makes it more or less relevant.

                "body": "# Introduction\n\n[My lolchess](https://lolchess.gg/profile/eune/sphisix/s6)\n\nHello fellow TFT gamers, I am Sphisix and challenger on EUNE. I was a consistent low GM player playing very flexibly. Until I met Innovators, they changed my life. I am a great advocate that the optimal playstyle should be a flexible one. Therefore forcing Innovators every game I found myself having mixed feelings. This comp is actually flexible and very strong, that is why it works. There is so many different variations, tips and tricks that I can not possibly cover. I am aware that this guide is very late but you can still get some LP playing it till the end of the set.\n\n# Main composition & Carries\n\n[Main comp](https://preview.redd.it/milj8wh68gg81.jpg?width=1465&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=759e4d5e1e773b2fbfb81378fe9a21e270233324)\n\nWhen I say primary and secondary carry I mean who you prioritize items for. This comps plays around Seraphine as primary carry and Fiora as secondary carry. Other secondary carries can also be Jayce, Heimer, Orianna. Personally I think that the actual carry of Innovators is Fiora. Even without items she is super strong right now. She can also carry a lot of different items. Orianna is also very strong if not OP, but sometimes has weird AI which can make you lack a lot of damage. Heim is good for early/mid game, but can carry late if three-starred. Of course Jayce is the strongest unit but as an OTP I can not rely on playing around a 5 cost unit. Jayce I mostly use frontline, because that is the only thing comp lacks. Backline Jayce carry is very strong, but is item dependent, also should be two starred. Having Sera, Fiora, Ori as carries, almost always I would prefer Jayce in the frontline. Unless he rolls backline items on TG.\n\nInnovators are actually a level 7 comp. The standard comp is you have 5 Innovators plus Janna and Ori. Level 8 and even 9 are flex, they depend on items, augments and emblems that you get. Level 8 is either Fiora or Taric most of the times. Although more often it is Fiora. It is Taric only if you don't have Fiora 2, lobby has a lot of AP boards and socialite spot is good for Sera or Ori. Sometimes on level 8 if you hit you can even put in a random 2\\* 5 cost . I played a few games where I started \"Scrap Heart\" on 1-4, played strong early, and then played Jinx 2 on level 8 for 4 scrap. Also Jhin if you for some reason took \"Clockwork Heart\", even Viktor etc. There was a game where I high-rolled and played Viktor 2, Jinx 2, Jayce 2 with Enchanters. So you should have an open mind playing this comp. Think of it as a late game comp that offers a lot of utility and enables carries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* With Scholar Emblem you are playing Yuumi on 8 instead of Fiora.\n* If you are playing Heimer carry, probably not going Fiora, but frontline and utility (Taric).\n* I see a lot of people playing Camille instead of Ori when playing Fiora. I do not think 2 Challenger is worth dropping Orianna 2. It might be worth only when you have Fiora 2 with items and Ori 1 with no items. 2 Challenger can be pretty good, but Fiora already has a gap-closer with her spell. With QSS you don't even need Challenger that much.\n* Taric= frontline/utility; Fiora= damage. Choose one according to your needs. If you have a more damage oriented Seraphine items, even Ori, or lacking Jayce, consider playing Taric over Fiora.\n\n# Items\n\n*Everything listed is written from best to worst.*\n\n[Items tier list](https://preview.redd.it/054nxfjq2fg81.jpg?width=1075&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9cdebdb88729d0f53a52518265f071dbb71b2353)\n\n**Portable forge tier list:**\n\nS tier: Manazane (Seraphine); Randuin's Sanctum; Infinity Force (Fiora); Eternal Winter (Jayce)\n\nA tier: Death's Defiance (Fiora); Obsidian Cleaver (Fiora)\n\nB tier: Gold Collector (Could be good if picked up early); Anima Visage (Jayce); Rocket-Propelled Fist; Zhonya's Paradox\n\n**First carousel component priority:**\n\n**tear > rod > cloak > sword > bow > belt > vest > glove**\n\nChoosing first component should be the one you do not mind having a pair of. Also if its items are good early and the component can be used many times. On every succeeding carousels you should get items depending on PVE drops. Keep in mind that items that have dropped already have a less chance of dropping again and vice versa.\n\nGood news, Morello and Shojin are the only items you truly need. Playing without Morello is a death wish. Also playing Morello without Shojin on Seraphine will make it way less effective. Shiv is very good in this comp, and should be prioritized as well. Chalice will also always be good. Thief's Gloves is good on both Fiora and Jayce, but glove component is bad. Your carry will depend on items you get, also tempo (early hit). Only play 1 Shiv or Spark. The truth is every item can be used in Innovators well.\n\nOther then Morello and Shojin, which should always be prioritized, slamming other items early will depend on your early game carries. For example, if you have Camille 2 and know you will play Fiora, you can slam Titan's early if no better options.\n\nI guess if you do not have Seraphine items early, you could possibly build Fiora items and play them on Ezreal. I haven't played any games like this but I assume it would be a totally viable strategy as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Good early item slams (from best to worse):**\n\nMorello; Shojin; Shiv; Chalice; TG; Titan's; Warmogs; Bramble (if AD lobby); D. Claw (if AP lobby); Rabadon's; BB; Archangel's;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Best in slot per unit:**\n\n**BIS Seraphine: Morello; Shojin; Rabadon's.** Good third items also are: Shiv; Archangel's; QSS; JG (with chalices); GS; RFC;\n\n**BIS Fiora: GS; BT; Titan's.** Also good: TG; GA; HOJ; QSS; RFC; LW; Hurricane; DB; IE; JG\n\n**BIS Orianna: Shojin; Rabadon's; Shiv.** Also good to carry Chalice, Banshee's, Zeke's\n\n**BIS Heimerdinger: Blue Buff, Rabadon's; GS.** Also viable: Gunblade; JG; Archangel's; even Shojin over BB;\n\n**BIS Jayce: Titan's; Bramble; D. Claw** Also good: TG; Warmog's; Gargoyle; Redemption; FH; Spark; even BB;\n\nBackline Jayce items I would almost always prefer on Fiora, and have him just be a tank (even with no items).\n\nJayce and Fiora can carry a lot of different items.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Item stats from my games](https://preview.redd.it/nieia86x5fg81.jpg?width=791&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fd9c422a4988649111e5954058f3e23022ea7d80)\n\n# Augments\n\n[Prismatic augment tier list](https://preview.redd.it/b7xzjltxlfg81.png?width=1075&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=85d4cb9ca45630b022f2c037810e1ef6f0cd628d)\n\nMakeshift and Band of Thieves can actually be in S tier, but I put them in A because they have bad synergy together and are situational. Prismatic games can be hard, unless you hit.\n\n[Gold augment tier list](https://preview.redd.it/a0jbolrzlfg81.jpg?width=1075&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=30ebee038ac9f7390ecf5461f0cd58d4c07c2b23)\n\n[Silver augment tier list](https://preview.redd.it/dc1527nfofg81.jpg?width=1075&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4c2092b11d60247739b363d89082bc13673cc09a)\n\n# Gameplay\n\nAll about strong early boards! If you have too much of a random board, transitioning can be hard. Therefore always try to lean more towards Innovators and regular early boards that go with them (list below). Obviously you need good econ as well. Balancing strong boards and econ is a topic on its own. But generally you play early what the game gives you. That kind of playstyle gets you the most value for gold invested and saves you HP. And that is your only goal here, get gold, save HP.\n\n**Some ground rules:**\n\n* slam items early (see above)\n* not rolling on stage 2\n* try to streak (win or lose)\n* leveling is good\n* stabilize on stage 3\n\n**Never fast 9!** I wonder how much LP I lost because of this. Level 9 for Innovators is fake. I am not saying you should not go level 9, a lot of times you will. But never go fast level 9. You need to stabilize first. Remember this comp is almost a level 7 comp. Although, it relies on 4 cost carries so you will not be hitting 2 stars till level 8 probably. Going 8, hitting two star Seraphine, Ori and Janna for infinite utility and playing Fiora for damage is a complete comp. Jayce is very strong, but relying to hit Jayce is not an optimal playstyle. Fast 9 can only be good if you have an early Fiora 2 with strong board and Innovator heart.\n\nWith this in mind, know that rolling on 7 is not bad. If you are having a bad game or want to keep win streaking, know that rolling on 7 is acceptable. Seraphine, Janna, Orianna and Fiora are so strong that rolling on 7 in order to get them early can be a viable option. Also this comp being fairly contested plays in favour of rolling earlier then others. If not for Innovators, then Ori and Janna are surely very contested and very strong.\n\nOther then that most of the times you are looking to roll and get your full comp on level 8. But it is not a fast 8 playstyle, you will be rolling on 6 and 7 a lot of times as well.\n\n**Scout and focus on positioning for every round!** If you are lower elo and have a hard time doing it, you do not have to stress a lot about it. But with a consistently good positioning and economy, hitting Master can be pretty easy.\n\n# Early comps\n\nWhat you should know while building strongest board with random units is that there are three types of units: tank; damage and utility. Early game utility is not that beneficial, so you should just focus on balancing your board between tankiness and damage. Some viable utility like Taric (if hit early) can be good, but most of the times he is just too expensive for stage 2. But if you hit a two star, he can be played to win-streak. Same goes for any other unit.\n\nLose streaking is also a viable tactic, just try to save as much HP as possible, level to 6 on 3-2 and roll to stabilize.\n\nA lot of times trying to play strongest board you will be having a board full of random units. But here are some boards so you have a reference towards what you should be building.\n\n* Camille is broken. Best early unit.\n\n[Standard level 4](https://preview.redd.it/ot66iitq6fg81.jpg?width=412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=836180513fd4411211a60a9028e7d390bec0c97f)\n\nOther openers:\n\n* 2 Bodyguard + Carry \\[Darius; Poppy; Caitlyn (Cait saves a lot of HP)\\]\n* 3 Yordle: Poppy; Ziggs; Lulu; Blitz (for econ)\n* Protector + Carry\n* 4 scrap\n\n# Mid-game\n\n* Mid-game Lissandra carries Seraphine items, even Ekko.\n* Heimer can carry Shojin and be remade later.\n* Early Morello carriers: Singed; Camille; Ziggs; TF;\n\n[Chemtech Innovators \\(best level 6\\)](https://preview.redd.it/3gph4n6rcfg81.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=789b0fb933c650416796ab68b13d2ac1febba8ee)\n\n[Yordles \\(Vex 2 \\\\\"carry\\\\\"\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ygm44qbxcfg81.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=828ed8fbd8d6e2b6cc3620f10511d991f5094731)\n\nMost of the times your board will be a mix of all these. Sometimes you are forced to pick an augment that gives you an extra trait (Heart or Crest) then you need to be creative: 4 (3+1) Bodyguard, Scrap or even Arcanist. But always try to stick to Innovators to save gold and have a much easier transition.\n\nYou do not need too many early options. Most if not all early and mid game boards of mine are either: **Innovator; Chemtech; Yordle; even Bodyguard or Scrap**\n\n# Stages breakdown\n\n**Stage 1 (PVE)**\n\nStart picking up your early units according to the given boards above. Camille, Innovators, Yordles most of the times. If you hit a good 3 cost via an orb you can look to play around it. 3 costs like: Heimer; Lissandra; Vex. Also possible: Malz; MF; Ekko. Even Taric or Leona. But if you can hit 10 gold on stage 1, you are probably selling for econ, unless it's Heimer. No way you are selling Heimer.\n\nIf you do not hit 10g but have excess gold you can look to pre-level if you have a strong board.\n\n**Stage 2**\n\nTake a look at your board. How strong is it? Are you winning or losing? Are you leveling or econing? Can you play a strong level 4 board or staying on 3 to econ? Personally I like leveling most of the times. You get better odds for units, also your board is stronger, so might save hp. If your board is very weak or there is not much of a difference between your level 3 and level 4 board. Don't level and econ up. Keep your tempo going. If you are losing, you are losing. If you are winning you should be looking to win. Streaking is very good.\n\nYou should slam items most of the times. We talked about which items you should look to create early. Decide soon and have a plan ahead of yourself. If you have only rod and tear you are obviously not making AA, because those components are for Morello and Shojin. But if you have cloak next to it, go ahead and make chalice.\n\nOn 2-4 carousel get your second component for either an immediate item or future items.\n\n**Stage 3**\n\nIf you have a win-streak going. You can level to 6 on 3-1, roll to spike if you have something to hit and try to keep the streak going. Level 6 is very important and a great breaking point of the game. On level 6, you should be having a complete board for your mid-game and look to start transitioning slowly for your full Innovator board.\n\nOn 3-2 level to 6 regardless, roll if you have some pairs or a very weak board.\n\nOn 3-5 You should level to 7 if win-streaking. Or if you just have excess gold and not going to lose much. Leveling on 3-5 will give you 3 to 4 free rolls of level 7 odds, which is actually a lot when playing Innovators. You can stay 6 if 7 is not a big spike and you are not win-streaking, so would rather econ.\n\n**Stage 4**\n\nIf you have a win-streak going you should level to 7 if haven't already and roll some to hit your Innovator comp units. Or if you are very low, you should also probably level to 7 and roll. If you have a lot of gold you can even go fast 8 on 4-2, or sometimes sacrifice some more HP to go on 8 on 4-5. If you have been rolling on 7, you are probably going 8 on stage 5.\n\n**Stage 5**\n\nYou should already have your full comp. Here you will be deciding if you are strong enough to go 9 or rolling on 8. You should most of the times be rolling on 8 till you hit 2 stars of your 4 cost units. Here you should stabilize once and for all no matter what you hit or don't hit.\n\nFocus on positioning, scout. If you have most of your core items, go for items that are good against enemy comps.\n\n**Stage 6**\n\nBloodshed.\n\n# Closing words\n\nWould strongly advise checking my match history and learning a bit from there as well.\n\nI am sorry for the late guide. But if you want to get some LP before the end of the set you should jump in your games and abuse this comp. Feel free to comment and ask whatever you wish, I will be glad to help! Hope the guide helps you and was somewhat educational and understandable. If you go 8th, remember my motto: \"Losing is winning\". Meaning that when losing you are learning. When learning, you are winning. Thank you for your time and best of luck!\n\n# Contact\n\nI am interested in offering coaching sessions, so feel free to contact me.

When you weren't born yet you couldn't think or remember anything, you were just braindead. \n\nYou would never feel the torture of eternity in this supposed black void because there would be no YOU to experience it.\n\nThere being an afterlife sounds so much more painful to me. Let's say hypothetically I will be in heaven.\n\nThere's only a finite amount of things in the universe and an eternity of existence. So I will learn everything there is to be learned in this universe and experience all that can be experienced. \n\nI'll see all the solar systems and planets, learn all the secrets in the universe and how it works. Then what? \n\nI will have to exist wether I want to or not and keep thinking for the rest of eternity. There will be nothing new and all the wonderful things in paradise will become mundane and uninteresting.\n\nWhat a torture that would be. Once I no longer exist I won't have to suffer with becoming bored because there will be no ME to become bored.\n\nI'm pretty sure they never thought too deeply about the afterlife, but I just find it so absurd how they believe this statement without even putting thought into it.\n\n I guess not everyone wants to think about death because they're afraid of it. Oh well, you can't keep running away from the fact because it will happen to us all."

Racism against black and west Asian students at the borders??

Many of us are children of immigrants who fled wars that shouldn\u2019t have happened, We could\u2019ve had progressive countries but they wouldn\u2019t allow it simply bcuz we\u2019re Middle Eastern/ south Asian or African bcuz of the ongoing wars and terrorism funded by the west. I\u2019m a proud ex Muslim and could give 0 Fs about Islam and their leader but I have to agree with the Muslim community 100% and I\u2019m really disappointed with these posts. I hate what is happening in Ukraine and I love the support they\u2019re getting full heartedly and I support them but I also can see the bias as a poc..\n\nEDIT: \nIt\u2019s sad how yll deflecting the issue here smh it\u2019s not about religion it\u2019s about people dying.

Further, our species is so successful that the evolutionary traits that once aided us in survival are the very ones wreaking havoc in our modern societies as we transition from a low population species to an global record breaking population species. \n\nRacism? In-group favoritism. Once a resource managing strategy to ensure survival in the face of little resources is now the trait that is used to hoard and deny resources as well as driving people to kill in offense, rather than in defense. \n\nIndividuality brought on by evolving in low population environments often clashes with the needs of a massive population.  Selfish leaders will act in self interest even if straining or killing those lower than them. Fierce individuals from below are often ended or marginalized for trying to fight the majority. \n\nSecurity holes in the human mind are often gamed by tech companies and there hasn't been enough time for the human mind to take the time to increase efficiency by patching those holes. \n\nI would not complain if we made technological progress grind to a halt for the next few centuries so that our genome can have some time to catch up. The other faster ways are unethical. We can work out kinks in our existing systems, sort out our fascination with prestige and actually value true worth. \n\nI wouldn't mind an entity or race that can go toe to toe with humans. it would clean up a lot what is wrong with this anthropocentric world. If I die, then so be it. I wasn't good enough. \n\nI'm venting here because I've lost a lot of faith in humanity. sure we can do good in the world but often I am painfully reminded what the wild success of our species cost us: our evolutionary pressures that keep us at the best we can be. \n\nEverything said and done I have no plan to do anything about it.

Only thing is, is that for a couple of months now. I started to feel much less creative, and Intelligent. Like I said I'm used to it by now. Feeling extremely depressed, getting stressed out very easily, and doubting myself all the time. But when I started feeling less intelligent, I felt like I took a bullet to the chest. As I love solving mental puzzles, and theorizing ideas about the universe(Logical Reasoning, Lateral Thinking, Abstract Reasoning, thought experiments, etc). And I wanted to become Theoretical Physicist, or an Astronomer. Those were my hobbies, along with gaming...I don't really have many friends as you can probably tell lol. Oddly enough, I didn't pick up the puzzles hobby until I just started feeling depressed a couple years back. I didn't share my hobbies with anyone though, as I didn't want to. Because I felt so different from everyone else, that no one understood me, so it was extremely hard for me to relate to them. But that's why I have different personalities for each friend lol. It always gave me satisfaction when doing things like these, and that was enough to keep me going. But now I'm feeling Way less motivated to solve anything because when I do I feel like a Absolute Idiot, gaming barely entertains me anymore, and I'm starting to get really scared now. Because Intelligence & Creativity, were my skills. If I didn't have them. then who would I be. They weren't always though, as in middle school & kindergarten my parents were told I had some sort of learning disability, and apparently something called \"Fine Motor Delay\" in my hands. So in middle school, anything, or any classes my teachers didn't think I could handle/do, I taken out of. I didn't know this back then though. I have more control over my classes in High School though, luckily. So School was hell for me then, and it is NOW. I still don't understand a single thing they're trying to teach me, which makes me worry for my career, since my grades are JUST above average. Sorry for the rant, I'm just Really scared that I'm losing myself, and everything along with it. Everynight I feel like I just want to run away from home, and isolate myself. I have also have suicidal thoughts. But I've been seeing a Psychologist for just a little bit(which seems to be going really well actually :). I am new to this reddit page btw. But does anyone else feel like they're losing/lost their intelligence/creativity, or sense of self???"

This story appears mainly in the Hadith and not the Quran (a collection of short stories and proverbs concerning the life of the prophet which in my opinion (and this may anger other muslims) are unreliable from a historiographical perspective). Moreover, there is no mention of virginity explicitly in this passage; the adjective purity is used instead. While this certainly does have some connotation of virginity I would argue that this refers more to an idea of righteousness and eternal youth. I hope this has cleared up this misconception which does indeed frustrate me to no end. Please do not allow your prejudices and emotions to obscure your minds\u2019 capacity for critical thought. There are 1 billion of us Muslims in the world, many of us share some of the western values of the countries that we may live in. I personally am a British citizen. If we were all as bad as you think we are the world would be a lot worse off.

This is the path the AI always seems to take in my games and it always ends badly for them. They always end up getting pupeted by whoever wins unless of course the CSA wins in that case they just get a participation trophy which seems just as bad to me. Is it possible for them to rescind the Mexican cession or is that only in vanilla hoi4 with the Redeem Aztlan focus or will the totalist Mexicans always just end up with egg on their face like I did when I tried to go down that focus. Might have to try it again tho, after I try to reunite the USSR as Latvia because I always try to make things as easy and stress free for myself as possible."

I've helped so many overcome emotional and mental problems, everything from getting stuck on exes down to suicide. I always knew that I was lying to myself to some extent, but I didn't think it was this bad. I only realized that I have been suicidal for a while now through a fucking fanfic. Legit, I read a story about a suicidal person and I was like: \"this sounds waaaaaaaay too familiar.\" only then, did I think deeply about it. I started thinking of ways to commit suicide; I came to the conclusion that pain medication overdose would be the best way to off myself. Maybe take it all before I go to school so my cries for help would be finally heard, but that would be a waste of money; I might as well just do it in my room when everyone's sleeping.\n\nThe worst part is: My friend group, a group of friends that basically saved me unintentionally from toxic friends, is breaking apart cuz i moved to a different country. My childhood best friend of 10 years has opened up to me about it, and I tried to fix it by confronting the problem, but she instead threatened to kill herself. On top of that, she made it clear that she did not give a shit about what I was going through. Later, we made up. The next day, I was talking to my mum about a person selling products to prevent suicide and how she could've at least heard him out. I was overreacting; I didn't realize we were busy. She got rightfully angry at me and ranted about how she's busy with her own problems like taking care of me and running her business. I fought back and said something about lending one minute to prevent suicide. My heart dropped when she screams, \"Everyone feels suicidal sometimes, maybe I'll commit suicide one day!\" I didn't want her to actually commit suicide so I shut my stubborn mouth. \n\nAfter those events, I was determined to go back to being the \"Therapist friend\", which almost drove me over the edge before. However, I could not care less about my health; I'm too much of a wuss to actually off myself. But I'd be lying if I ever imagined myself jumping off of my balcony to slowly bleed to death.\n\nIt took two people in my life to convince me that no one would mourn me, which is the sole reason why I didn't want to commit suicide back then; I didn't want people to follow me. My best friend would easily move on, she's surrounded by many people who could help her through. My mother will inevitably cry, but she'll be happy that I'm joining her mother. My dogs, I definitely will miss, but I just hope they're adopted to a devoted family who will give them lots of toys.\n\nI love my friends and family to death\n\nThank you for hearing me out, whoever you are. :\\]"

There are some cool tricks here, but if you wanna go with a totally node-based approach then I have a cool tip for you. With this, you are gonna do everything in the Shader Editor. This is the node tree [https://ibb.co/3CRmH48](https://ibb.co/3CRmH48).\n\nLet's break it downFirst, we use a Noise Texture with a Color Ramp (to create anything random like puddles or moss gathered on a rock we use this combination which is pretty popular among Blender artists) and connect that to the Fac of the Mix Shader. Now on the first shader, you connect your Principal BSDF (the rock texture one), and on the second shader, you connect a Diffuse Shader. Now the Color input on the Diffuse Shader is connected with the color of the Hue/Saturation node with the Color (of the Hue/Saturation node) set to a...well...a blood color.\n\nWhy?Let me tell you why. When blood falls on any surface, after some time this blood gets very sticky but not so sticky as a jam but sticky enough to give a hard oil paint effect (due to iron present in the blood). So for this, we use a Diffuse Shader (we don't need a Principal Shader as we don't want to play with additional settings) with a Hue/Saturation node to help us control the color of the blood. Play with the Roughness value of the Diffuse Shader and pick one which fits your scene best. With the Noise texture, you basically create a cloud texture and you use that as a mask to mix two textures. With the Color Ramp, you affect the intensity of the mask to get better control over the mixing of the textures. Play with different functions of the Color Ramp (Ease, Linear, Cardinal, B-Spline & Constant).\n\nOptional:-Lastly (if u want to) add a Bump texture and use the Color from the Color Ramp and connect that to the Height of the Bump node (with the strength set to 0.5 or less coz we don't need too much depth) and connect the Normal of the Bump node to the Normal of the Diffuse Shader. Why? Well, puddles are basically a little deep than the normal surface and it adds a little bit of realism. This is the node tree with the Bump node [https://ibb.co/Y8dyc30](https://ibb.co/Y8dyc30)\n\nThis is how it would look if you did all the steps correctly (these screenshots are with the Bump node activated)[https://ibb.co/3CLqHvz](https://ibb.co/3CLqHvz)[https://ibb.co/3Sq0h5t](https://ibb.co/3Sq0h5t)[https://ibb.co/5kpLrqy](https://ibb.co/5kpLrqy)\n\nIf the links are not working, just copy & paste them! English is not my native language so pls forgive me if you find my English horrible. If you have any doubts related to this pls feel free to ask as I have time so I keep checking Reddit every day.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: If you want smooth blood then definitely play around with the Roughness value of the Diffuse Shader.",

The wounds are looking good. He's positive for fiv. He plan on sterilizing him to avoid further conflict with other cats. We'll keep him in a cage at home until he's doing better. He's calm and doing good. Thank you for your advice.\n\nThis is him at the vet https://imgur.com/a/6jkx4Z6"

I know that\u2019s a little different than how things play out in the US, but I\u2019ll give you my story anyway.\n\nMy father, brother, and I all attended Catholic school from K-12. So far, I\u2019m the only one still practicing. I\u2019ve moved out of my family home for university, and I have finally begun practicing my faith again. The three of us never really practiced (my mother was baptized in the United Church of Canada and still doesn\u2019t practice), my brother and I were just given the sacraments, and my father never really took us to mass unless I specifically asked to go. I think Catholic school helped me to keep in mind that I am Catholic, but most of my deepening in the faith came from things like YouTube. Many great Catholic channels helped me better understand and appreciate my faith.\n\nI think Catholic schools can help, especially by reminding us that we are Catholic even if our homes aren\u2019t demonstrating that. That said, it doesn\u2019t ensure that your children remain faithful Catholics. It most certainly isn\u2019t sinful or disrespecting God if you pull your children from these schools, especially if their continued enrollment will be a financial burden on your family. My father's parents are Portuguese immigrants and faithful Catholics. They always took him to mass and put him through Catholic school, but he still ended up lapsing in his faith. Sometimes seemingly doing everything right doesn\u2019t help our children retain their faith.\n\nOverall, the one thing I will most certainly encourage is prayer. It\u2019s essential to recognize that, even if we try our hardest to raise children to be Catholics, it sometimes doesn\u2019t stick. This is why praying to God is so important. It\u2019s God who ultimately moves our hearts to live out our faith. Have faith and pray that God may help your children keep their belief and practice alive. Keep living out your faith as an example to your children; it certainly helps, at the very least, as a reminder.\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to pray for you and your family. Take care!",

If you\u2019re anxious about actually admitting yourself, remember that it\u2019s for the best, and even if you dont think itll help or youre scared to be away from home, the time you spend inpatient and the treatment youd get (from a high quality hospital) is 100% worth it. hospitals saved my life, and if you think theres even a chance you need one, go",

I was tired, had a headache from crying so hard, and I had times where I dissociated.\n\nMy three year old nephew was pretty wild. He pulled down his pants to his knees and ran around showing his bare butt to the guests (twice), demanded others color in his coloring book EXACTLY how he wanted, kept getting a hold of some bible (I think the cover said \"The Methodist Hymnal\") opened it to a page with music notes and pointed to the page before asking an adult to use the page to sing \"Baby Shark\" and then let out a big cry before hiding when people said no, cried when adults he didn't know tried talking to him and told my aunt \"they keep talking to me, tell them to shut up please\", among other things.\n\nI'm not someone who gets annoyed with kids quickly. Honestly, I thought (most) of his stunts were funny and I desperately needed a distraction.\n\nWell, I ended up getting scolded by my aunt for letting him do his most minor offense-- gently closing a door. He was pouting as he hid behind a door because he was told no about something. I tried cheering him up so he would stop hiding. Then he gave a smile and gently pushed the door. It didn't slam, just gave a soft click.\n\nAnd my aunt scolded me for it, said exactly what the title says \"You're the aunt; it's your job to discipline him.\"\n\nLike hell it is. I don't know kids. I don't know how to handle them and I don't magically know this stuff just because my sister popped him out three years ago.\n\nAnd why get mad at me for letting him close a door, but not mad at my sister for letting him show his bare ass to 50+ people *twice*?\n\nI love him to death, but he is *not* my responsibility. Want me to keep an eye on him so he stays in the building  doesn't spontaneously die? Sure. Otherwise, I don't have the skills to deal with him and it shouldn't even be my responsibility to do so.\n\nI'm just annoyed. This isn't the first time I've been told this, but it is the worse time. My sister gets a free pass to let her son get into chaos without anyone saying a damn thing because Grandma died, but I'm judge for my nephew acting up in front despite him not being my responsibility and that I'm grieving just as much as my sister.\n\nI just needed to complain. I feel so done right now."

She still told me this was \"no excuse\" and that I should know better. I still don't understand. It could have just been a learning experience for us, something we could grow from, but she didn't see it like that.\n\nShe threw me away right at the point in our relationship where I was ready to tell her I loved her. It's been a couple months now, but I still feel abandoned and unlovable and I don't know how not to feel that way. I don't talk about it with my friends because I'm afraid others just expect me to have gotten over it by now, but it still hurts.\n\nAnd despite all of this...I'm still worried about her. That's stupid, right? Yet I am. I'm worried that if this is a trend in her life than she'll never be happy because she'll continue to push others away over minor things. But I don't have any right to worry over her. Not anymore."

I watched both ATLA and LOK when I was 15, first ATLA where I loved the feeling of it, like the world and the fact that there were fewer characters that all got to develop equally, my favorite character was Zuko.  \n\n\nAfter I finished ATLA I watched LOK, contrary to many shows I watch, my favorite character was Korra, the protagonist, I related to her journey and struggles. The villains were better than in ATLA and more fleshed out. The world felt more fast paced and modernized where I missed the feeling of ATLA's world with small villages and few characters.   \n\n\nThe criticism I would have for LOK is the disconection from past lives but if they make this a plotline in the new avatar show then I am satisfied.",

We kinda ghosted each other after that. And that I'm really awkward in groups. \n\nFrom seventh and eighth grades, I always used to get excluded, meaning isolated by others. It was because I had only joined in seventh grade whereas the rest had been together since nursery and stuff. You know, the stigma around the 'new' kid. IDK if that was the main cause of me still being a loner, isolating myself. I just DON'T KNOW how to fit in with other ppl.  \n\nI have two very close best friends, am very blessed to have them, and I love forming close connections rather than just surface ones. \n\nIn ninth, when I was a loner, our class was shuffled; \\[seveth and eight had had the same people\\] they tried including me. I was just so AWKWARD. I couldn't relate much to them, I guess. they tried. I wasn't like making a very good effort. And all of them were guys and I was NOT very comfortable with them. \n\nA person \\[fake name\\] - Moss, they didn't give up on me in the beginning, trying to include me like the other guys were. I wouldn't be as alone when we sat together. He was a really cool friend, for like, four or five months. He became a good friend to me at school. Then he said he had had a crush on me for three months. And I was kinda afraid everyone would find out - because I didn't think anyone - my parents mainly loll - would appreciate it at ALL. I was really surprised. Cuz I liked to think of him as a brother... and also he was the first person who'd said they had had a crush on ME the weirdo. \n\nA friend of mine who disapproved of our friendship used to make fun of pockmarks on his skin. - Tbh, that made me kinda insecure abt the pocks because I was seen sitting with him and stuff. Not a good mentality, but there were already a lot of judgemental idiots in my class and I didn't wanna be judged by them. \\[selfish ik\\]  \n\nAfter he told me that he liked me, he started giving... \\['creepy'ig\\] looks. Anddd \\~\\~ Fall back into the same thing. I wasn't physically bullied or anything. I was ignored a little. I probably also am a sensitive worm\n\nMaybe I just WAS and AM always a shy kid who sucks at making friends.\n\nI don't remember feeling LONELY as such, but I know I've felt that feeling. Everyone probably has. But I certainly felt a little alone. \n\nBeing an awkward kid is NOT nice at all.\n\nLast year I joined a new school for eleventh. Even here, I've seen that I'm not very confident about my social skills. I'm kind of a 'voluntary' loner at this new school too. Everyone's new here, we don't know each other well or anything. In class I'm always like not mixing in with others, I'm scared to do it, kind of."

Young primates starting a life of [self-harm](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-harm) because they observed it? The brain strives to avoid pain. What could motivate it to initiate pain? \u201cStress\u201d is not an adequate answer because a survival-driven organism has incentive to avoid pain when stressed.  \n>  \n>I searched for an answer, and ran across the story of a bonobo mother who actually pulled her child\u2019s hair out. She did it for so long that the hair stopped growing back. This was not [aggression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger), but \u201cgrooming gone wild\u201d in the words of Barbara Natterson-Horowitz. She explains in *Zoobiquity* that grooming is nature\u2019s self-soothing strategy. Animals groom others as well as themselves, and that builds soothing social bonds. When the going gets tough, mammals groom. Many repetitive behaviors are variants on grooming. The behavior may get repeated endlessly if a mammal has a persistent sense of threat.  \n>  \n>You might blame zoos for that sense of threat, but life in the wild is [stressful](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress) too. In the state of nature, hunger threatens as soon as you stop foraging, and when you forage unsuccessfully. Predators lurk, and if you relax your vigilance you may end up watching your child being eaten alive. Social relations are precarious in the wild and a mammal often defers to avoid a conflict that can escalate into painful biting and clawing. Romantic illusions about life in the state of nature are wishful thinking.  \n>  \n>The mammal brain evolved to manage this stress. It builds skills for avoiding pain. Foraging skill avoids the pain of hunger. Predator- avoidance and conflict-avoidance skills avoid pain. In the state of nature, a mammal doesn't waste energy on counter-productive behavior. Harsh reality teaches it to reduce stress by taking care of business.  \n>  \n>But when a mammal\u2019s needs are met by others, as in captivity, it can invest energy in futile efforts without loss of food or safety. The brain might even connect futile efforts to the successful meeting of its needs. Food and protection keep coming when the mammal self-harms, so the brain has reason to expect more of the same. The mammal brain constantly wants to \u201cdo something\u201d to promote its well-being. It does whatever worked in the past. Once a self-destructive behavior appears to \u201cwork,\u201d the mammal brain repeats it as if its life depended on it.  \n>  \n>This is relevant to self-harm in humans. People repeat a wide range of behaviors that hurt themselves. Many self-destructive behaviors are homologous to the grooming habits of other primates. Stress is often blamed for self-destructive behavior. But reducing stressors often fails to stop such habits. For example, let\u2019s say my child invests a lot of her energy in self-destructive behavior. I decide to reduce her stress so I do everything nice I can think of to \"help\" her. From her mammal brain's perspective, harmful behavior gets rewards. This is what her brain \"knows\" about how the world works. In my eagerness to \"support\" her, I deprive her of valuable opportunities to learn the connection between her actions and real-world outcomes. I may cause her as much suffering as those bonobo mothers.  \n>  \n>article continues after advertisement  \n>  \n>What is the alternative? We cannot withholding food and protection from children, but we can stop rewarding self-destructive behavior in other ways. We can pay closer [attention](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention) to what we reward and restrain ourselves from well-intentioned responses that inadvertently reward self-harm. We can reward self-enhancing behavior while we carefully avoid rewarding bad habits.  \n>  \n>In the state of nature, well-being depends on a creature's skill at meeting its needs. Experience builds skill in foraging, avoiding predators, and grooming allies. And skill brings a sense of security that one will be able to meet one's needs despite a world of challenges. This is nature's stress relief. It builds in the state of nature because rewards depend on effective behavior. It doesn't build in an artificial environment because rewards come regardless of actions. The self-harming animal still gets its needs met so it does not learn from nature's feedback. Thus it never develops the sense of security that comes from personal effectiveness.  \n>  \n>People who work with animals know this. Humans know it instinctively, but our desire to \u201chelp\u201d can over-ride it."

I went through 5 hobbies (Investments, Blogging, Writing, A levels and Programming) in 2022 alone. \n\n-\n\n\ud83d\udc0d **Productivity** \ud83d\udc0d | Oh yah, I always procrastinate on assignments as I feel it unsatisfactory. Like dude, I want to learn, not pay dues and obligations? \n\nBut I\u2019m very productive when learning my hobbies. Like, really long attention span and borderline obsessive. (10 hours + what is lunch?) \n\n -\n\n\ud83c\udf70 **Communications** \ud83c\udf70 | I\u2019m really bad at it. Other people can\u2019t seem to understand me, and unless I put in constant effort to improve/learn, it stays that way. \n\nI\u2019m upset that no one likes me, but logically, I know I\u2019m not a nice person and I\u2019m probably too lazy/too awkward to cultivate and upkeep a friendship. \n\n-\n\n\u2601\ufe0f **Emotions** \u2601\ufe0f | I\u2019m anxious all the time because I feel like I\u2019m not good enough.   Emotions are wild, unpredictable and I\u2019m trying to find a way to manage them. \n\n~\n\n\ud83e\uddc1**Planning**\ud83e\uddc1 | Call me crazy but, yah, I do a lot of those. I have a timetable and review it every three days to make adjustments. I take notes of what can be improved daily and write them down on post-aids to ensure that I\u2019ll improve on it on the next plan. \n\n\nI designed and printed a few templates to streamline the process, and I have notes that plans ahead of time for burnouts, presentation, group projects, family etc. \n\n\n-\n\n  Stuff that are probably not that important: \n\n\ud83d\udcd6**Study** | Don\u2019t like it. In the media Industry where there is so much focus on \u2728networking\u2728that students are playing iPhones. \n\nNo structure and the lectures can barely understand their own marking criteria. \n\n-\n\n\ud83c\udfe1 **Upbringing** | Argues with my dad on a daily basis because I\u2019m pretty sure he is dishing out unsupported theories. \n\nLeads to me getting degraded. I try not to do argue as I have no self confidence. But unless I have my headphones on, the cycle repeats! Oh yay!"

I think my dad could get angry if i come out. I have a big brother, he's not transphobic ( i think so since he said hi to a trans women who was his girlfriend's friend ) but i'm not sure if he would support me. My grandma has been trying to force me to be more feminine many times while my grandad doesn't care, but i'm pretty sure he wouldn't understand or support me neither. I don't know if i shoud come out at all and if i do, how am i supposed to do it, or maybe am i supposed put obvious hints that i am trans, i gendered myself many times with \"he\", smiled when someone called me mister,  ( happens a lot and they see that i don't complain and that i'm happy when it happens ) and basically, there were very big signs of my me being trans when i was a kid.  how can i be more obvious ? I would rather not come out, but if it's the best solution then i'll try, but please give me some tips to hint that i'm not a girl and eventually to come out for later."

He also told me that classes were cancelled so I went back to my room and watched the broadcast until my family picked me up and took me back home.\n\nAt that point I wasn't sure if World War III was starting or not, so I just kind of waited for campus to reopen.

Many of his videos focus on the fundamentals (the unfun stuff,) as well as the learning process, from learning how to better retain information to avoiding burnout and stagnation.\n\nAs for books, Hikaru Hayashi has tons of books out there, his \"How to Draw Manga: Sexy Character\" book is a great reference but unfortunately has no English translation.  He also wrote the \"How to Draw Manga\" series that was translated to English, but I never found them terribly helpful as a new artist.\n\nI also really like \"How to Draw a Little Bit of Sexy Girls\" by Hou Tengeki.  It has no English translation that I know of, but the artwork and references are very helpful.\n\nFor English speaking authors, the two most ubiquitous that I know of are Mark Crilley and Christopher Hart.  Based on my last experience with Hart's manga drawing books, I'd avoid them, as they tend to focus on the step-by-step process without explaining construction or anatomy.  Crilley's \"Mastering Manga\" series I found to be a bit more helpful starting out, as he does explain his construction process quite well.  You will want to supplement them with more detailed anatomy lessons later on.\n\nOf course, there are countless more books.  Amazon reviews are very helpful in determining which might be worth it.",

                "body": "Sorry if this is old news.  Found a fix today for an issue with this game that's been bugging me.\n\nTL/DR Version: You can restore the missing voice lines from the game's units by removing the \"Special.mpq\" file from the game's directory.  (Confirmed: Works for GOG Version using Chaos Pegasis Spawn Fix mod)\n\nEDIT: Also seems to be working on the vanilla GOG Version.\n\nLong Version:  I remembered back in the day that the Order Mage Lord used to say the phrase \"Is this important?  I have a meeting to attend\" when you clicked on him.  Now however, he just says \"Order Be Praised.\"  Every time.  I agree Order should be praised but it's still annoying.  So I googled it and found a fix on another forum.\n\nApparently, the GOG version comes with a file called \"Special.mpq\" in the game's directory.  This file limits the number of voice lines said by the units for low-end systems.  As long as that file exists your Order mage will \"praise order\", your Life warrior will \"take positions,\" and every other unit in the game will dedicate itself to driving you insane by repeating the same line over and over.\n\nSo, go into the game's directory and remove or rename the \"Special.mpq\" file.  You can change it to \"Special.bak\" or make a new \"Backup\" folder and hide it there.  I wouldn't recommend deleting it, just in case something gets screwed up.  Having done this simple fix, my units are now saying different stuff and the game is less annoying.  Order be Praised!\n\n[Link to Forum Thread detailing fix](https://impz.proboards.com/thread/1500/attn-delgar)\n\n[Link to Patch Fixing Pegasus Spawn and Allowing Adjustable Scroll Speed](http://members.iinet.net.au/~peterykwong/lomse.htm)"

This can give you an indication if you're fully recovered or not. Though my heart rate goes down.

When I row in a quad, I do not have the time to remove all the water from the boat (backsplash or rain). So I end up with a case/bag laying in the water for about an hour or two. \n\nI use my phone to track my miles/km. I have a goal to row 2500k in a year, so I kinda need to track it. The case/bag is not for occasionally but 5/6 times a week. Most often I row in a single and that one almost always stays dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!"

Coping mechanisms often fail because my brain sets off alarm bells and accelerates the anxiety way too fast for me to figure out my breathing in time, especially when I wake up from a nightmare. I still live in the house where I grew up and was traumatized with the same parents who did horrible things and allowed horrible things to happen to me. The environment isn\u2019t safe for me to calm down and if I don\u2019t go for a walk or drive fast enough I retreat to my room and feel stuck in place, so then physically escaping the situation isn\u2019t an option anymore.

The first time it helped but I got a killer headache, but the second and third I just feel so at ease. No more alarm bells, triggers and intrusive thoughts are kept at bay, and I just feel genuinely happy for no reason. \n\nIn turn, I\u2019m thinking positively about the good things I have to look forward to as well as the future I\u2019m planning for myself, and honestly I\u2019m kind of living through it in my mind before it happens. It\u2019s like this super positive snowball effect. Ativan makes me happy, my thoughts turn positive, I start dreaming of the future and matching that happy state to what I\u2019ll make happen in a few years time, and I start to focus on the positive in the present, mainly what I\u2019m doing and working on to get to that future I dream of. It\u2019s like all of those negative emotions are completely removed and I can just be at peace for a while with my mind and body. It also helps relax my muscles that are always clenched or feeling tight, which provides some pain relief too. \n\nNow what worries me is that while this is wonderful, I can\u2019t take this every day. It\u2019s for emergencies. But the problem is that I feel like emergencies are happening almost daily. Breathing and grounding techniques fail often because my flashbacks and panic attacks accelerate so quickly, and with no support system I don\u2019t have anyone to help me pull out of it. I don\u2019t want to rely on Ativan to fix all my problems because it won\u2019t, but god does it make life just so much more bearable. It allows me to do what I have to do to escape one day. \n\nWhen I\u2019m triggered or flashing back I stay in place, because I feel stuck like I had been all throughout childhood. I couldn\u2019t leave the house, I couldn\u2019t do anything to escape the pain I was feeling, I was helpless. Once I\u2019m in that state it\u2019s nearly impossible to break out of. At this point my anxiety skyrockets and my body shuts down, and I would consider this an emergency situation, because my body and mind clearly see it that way. But this happens like every other day. How am I supposed to limit my use if I genuinely need it often? It just feels like a losing game and I don\u2019t know what to do\n\nDoes anyone take Ativan or another benzo every day or at least often? Does it help you? Is it even an option? I know it\u2019s not conventional but I\u2019ve tried a ridiculous amount of antidepressants, I\u2019ve tried blood pressure meds, antihistamines, and they all have problems that make it unable to work for me. As long as nothing unforeseen in terms of side effects happens like with the last one I tried (hydroxyzine, worked well for a week but made my acne a lot worse and gave me body pains and nightmares) then I think this is the one that would help me best. I\u2019m just scared that if it does turn out to be the best thing, that I\u2019ll be so limited to when I can take it that it just won\u2019t end up doing anything at all in the long term. I need to feel better most days to make any progress, not just one or two days a week and then I hide away and dissociate for the rest of it. \n\nI just wish I felt like this normally. Everyone else gets to feel okay and fine like this but I don\u2019t and it\u2019s unfair that one of my options to level the playing field is so limited."

Typically I am not able to transition so quickly from one focus to another as depicted. I tend to get lost in my mind more often than paying attention to my surroundings. But if something catches my eye, I will be thinking about that for awhile not moving so quickly to another focus.\n\nI think the video does a good job of pointing out the items that grab our attention. But at least for me my mind stays on something much longer.\n\nI do find life uncomfortable because for me it is way too fast paced, people are way too pushy and intense. I don't like loud noises, bright lights, socializing on groups etc. So yes these things are uncomfortable. But I often enjoyed going to the mall with friends or alone. I do suffer sometimes mainly because people don't understand me and my struggles so have unrealistic expectations.",

It's impossible to be both ways at once and it sucks because people will take their frustration out on you.

I am also shy and so is my son so I KNOW that I will be in your shoes. I also tend to be on the more verbal explanation side of things so I can definitely see myself doing something similar.\n\nBasically my point is that there really is no right way to parent and YOU know your child best. Don't doubt that you were trying to do right by him, and that coaching him is helpful! It's just that sometimes we don't realize how we come across to other parents but she didn't have to take it negatively. Anyway I think there's lots of great advice on here about keeping it shorter, addressing it later in private, and I LOVE the ideas about role playing with toys to help him learn.\n\nBut please do not overanalyze or ruminate over this any longer. You are not required to never make mistakes nor to consider every parenting style or temperament. You are responsible for you and your son and it sounds like you are doing amazing. All you can do is apologize to that lady and move on. Don't worry anymore \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97",

                "body": "My husband is sometimes condescending towards me when he is frustrated. His patience is zero. I do believe he has avoidant attachment, though I'm not sure because he seems to be very irritable and easily frustrated. I'm unsure if avoidant attachment has more of a cool detached feel. His feels like an angry detachment. \n\nAnyway when he is frustrated and condescending it sends me into fight or flight mode. I am definitely more of an anxious attachment type. I usually want to resolve the situation but get very stressed by his frustration and typically freeze in an attempt to regulate my emotions. This makes him more angry. If I do snap back we end up in a heated argument. \n\nWe have a toddler that is always with us. I don't want to fight in front of him but I also don't want him to see his mother be spoken down to and just \"take it\". So what course of action is recommended in these moments? Thank you for your time!"

So my husband was chatting with his mom about getting a wine gift for someone and she said just to ask me because \"she used to drink a bottle of wine a day.\" WTF. I never even drank a glass of wine a day or even a bottle a week. I am just so angry. Then after he got angry with her, she called her daughter and told her the same. What do you do when someone is making up stupid lies about you? I seriously want to just tell her I don't ever want to see her face again. Ughhhh. Thank you for listening."

I usually get trapped in conversations with people so I often avoid socializing altogether. How long should you chat before ending the conversation with an acquaintance at work so that you don't come off as clingy or as standoffish? Like someone that you're just saying hello to and having a quick polite chat with. What about at a party or wedding? Are they all about the same? While I'm at it how do you approach people standing in a circle chatting? I know this is a lot of questions but any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

I didn't fully realize this until lately, but as my life has become more and more comfortable and I've been able to avoid rejection without socializing I have less desire to try. I had some friends I would sometimes keep in touch with before Covid, but as covid became an easy out to avoid interacting with others, I've lost touch with almost all of them. And I don't really feel a desire to get back into contact. It's strange because I do miss them, but I also don't and I appreciate not having to deal with making plans etc. It doesn't feel worth the hassle. \n\nWhat motivates you guys to try to be social? I'm hoping I can find some motivation. I am married so I already have a partner. Between eachothers families, and work it really feels like already too much social interaction although I'm sure there's reasons for maintaining friendships? Even with the struggles we face as avoidants. I struggle to even feel motivated to socialize with family or coworkers anymore. I just don't feel the benefits that much?

(together 10 years married for 3) He gets so frustrated at small things like someone cutting him off driving or when he perceives someone being rude to him. He randomly gets angry with me over something small and suddenly has 25 things he's angry about that he acted like were fine 20 minutes ago. It really hurts my already low self esteem because instead of talking about how something is a problem he's just suddenly really angry and has a whole list. He raises his voice and he sometimes curses. I am honestly afraid of him at these times just because of what he might say it feels like he is willing to say very hurtful things. Sometimes he gets sarcastic and mocking. And has like a spitefulness in his voice.\n\nI know I don't deal with other people's anger well at all. I tend to think everything is my fault and don't really understand how people can be so angry to begin with. So that just makes it even harder. I don't know if it's me or him. I wonder if I should have left long ago. Now I'm pregnant. We've been working on this for as long as we've been together and just when I feel like it's getting better he's angry again. We have a therapist we share that we've been to together twice. I feel like an idiot, like I should have left. And now we're having this baby and I'm stuck.\n\nEdit:I feel like I should add that when he's not angry he's very reasonable and seems to understand how I feel. That's why it's confusing. He also thinks he's getting better but then it happens again. Also should clarify he would never physically harm. What I fear is his words. \n\n- - - \n\n**TL;DR;** : Husband has a bad temper.

Often the events go something like this;\n\n* I see a bullying scene or have an interaction that is less than ideal.\n* I leave the situation and try to laugh it off.\n* I have the situation the back of my mind; I try to cope with it by thinking back to my own bullying experiences and coming up with hypotheticals of how I could have \"solved\" them.\n* I lose control of the memories and it kinda feels like I'm back *in* them at times. Or at least like I am having my eyes propped open, made to watch these memories against my will.\n* Cue the tears.\n* That OR I \"turn off\" my emotions in order to relax.\n\nI am a freshman in college (not even a gap year) and these experiences aren't too far back in the past. I had episodes of the like after watching Stranger Things 4 with my family (character gets bullied in the second episode, I made jokes about it while watching but had a breakdown in private), and listening to Jeremy by Pearl Jam.\n\nMy mom and one of my sister's friends describe this as trauma. Don't know if that's the right word for it but I guess you could call these \"flashbacks.\" idk. \n\nPretty weird since none of the bullying I experienced was physical. Just verbal and social. I have autism so y'know pretty common. I still get kind of excluded by the snobby art kids in my college but they're sneaky with it to the point where I wouldn't even call it bullying, just general assholery.\n\nAnyone else have this?"

                "body": " \n\nThe brick walls layered in white paint that made up Wheaton High School had never caught my eye before. I would use them to lean on while checking my phone, write on them in Sharpie (which got me a week\u2019s detention) and occasionally run my hand on the cool, bumpy surface when passing classes. This Tuesday was different.\n\nFour of my classmates and I had skipped 8th period just to look at those walls. Well, I begged them to come with me, but you get the idea. We were standing like dumb stone statues outside Ms. Hsung\u2019s room, my 5th-period geometry teacher.\n\nTwo hours prior I was in that class, my eyes getting heavy, not taking notes. I remember, clear as day, that glass-breaking scream. It came from behind the walls, but it pierced my ears and knocked me straight out of my seat. My classmates heard it. Ms. Hsung heard it. A student from all the way across the campus heard it, he raced to our room to get as far away from the sound as possible. Funny, that scream was more audible than any of the announcements we had ever had.\n\nMy friend Adrianne, standing next to me, brown eyes latched onto that wall, cracked the wad of gum that was one among thousands she had ever chewed.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019m gonna find out, one way or another.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it was a senior prank,\u201d said a tall kid named Cass.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a bat or a raccoon or something,\u201d added a long-haired girl named Martina.\n\n\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d said a boy with glasses named Brad. \u201cI think Seth\u2019s wasting our time with another one of his \u2018theories.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, man, we all heard it!\u201d I said, placing my hand on Brad\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s *something*. It may not be a Loch Ness monster or a Sasquatch, but it\u2019s *something.* And it\u2019s in these walls.\u201d\n\nBrad raised his eyebrow.\n\n\u201cBrad,\u201d I pleaded, \u201cCan I please borrow your speaker? Dude? Pal? Buddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d he asked, prying my hand off his shoulder.\n\n\u201cIf we make some noise, we could trigger whatever\u2019s in there and get a better idea of what it is!\u201d\n\nBrad turned ghost-white, his eyebrows raised, nose crinkled in a look I can only describe as the look I had when I entered a bathroom stall in the upstairs building.\n\n\u201cY-You want t-to bring it h-h-h-here?\u201d Brad stammered.\n\n\u201cHey, man, it\u2019ll be for the pursuit of-\u201d\n\nBrad darted away before anyone could react. Note to self: don\u2019t ask a track team kid to accompany you when you\u2019re looking at something creepy.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d muttered Martina, \u201cThere he goes.\u201d Yeah, no duh.\n\nAdrianne tapped me on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a speaker, but we can always improvise,\u201d she said.\n\nI grinned. She grinned.\n\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Cass, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? I\u2019m scared.\u201d\n\nThe next thing I knew, I was throwing my pencils at the wall while Adrianne blasted music from her computer. Cass stood behind us, blanky watching.\n\n\u201cAh, screw it,\u201d said Martina, \u201cIt\u2019s better than having nothing to do in study hall.\u201d She took off one of her sneakers and tossed it at the wall, the resulting noise echoing through the halls.\n\nThen we heard it. A small cough, from the walls, muffled yet audible enough to freeze us in place. Silence took us over like someone had put us on mute. The realization then set in; we were not alone. I was right.\n\nThe four of us scattered from the area. The adrenaline carried my legs away from that wall, but I couldn\u2019t help but look back. I wasn\u2019t crazy. Maybe, just maybe, my classmates would listen.\n\nAs we rounded the corner we were met with the tall, burly figure of a man, a baseball cap perched on his bald head, his furrowed brows setting shadows over those beady eyes of his. Uh-oh.\n\nIf there\u2019s one person you don\u2019t wanna mess with inside Wheaton High, it\u2019s the hall monitor and gym teacher, Mr. Penthall. Some say he once was a drill sergeant, others argue that he damaged his frontal lobe in a car crash and lost his cool. Regardless, if you get caught by him, you might as well be jumping into an active volcano.\n\nMy feet skidded and directed me towards the door at the other end of the school, Penthall on my trail. Adrianne was struggling behind me. I grabbed her hand as we tried to evade the monitor\u2019s clutches.\n\nThe cathartic, robotic ring of the final school bell blessed us. An avalanche of kids poured into the halls, slowing Penthall down like mud.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna see us if we keep our heads up,\u201d said Addy. \u201cWe have to duck!\u201d\n\nI smiled as I submerged my head below herds of high schoolers. Those small moments where Adrianne would strategize never failed to amuse me. The heavy clunking of Penthall\u2019s shoes grew quieter with each passing second. Thank god.\n\nThe exit looked to be a thousand miles away. I felt like a traveler stranded in a desert, reaching for a canteen of water. I stretched my arm out and allowed my hand to press onto the metal handle, the streaks of light hitting us in the face. I turned back to Addy as I walked outside.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we made it,\u201d I said. \u201cThat could\u2019ve been a close-OW!\u201d\n\nMy head had collided with someone else\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWatch it, dingus!\u201d shrieked a familiar nasal voice. Oh, jeez.\n\nMy sister, Dina, is two years older than me and seems to think that being a senior has changed her. I would beg to differ. She\u2019s still the same snobby know-it-all. People say we look alike, with our dark Egyptian skin and our wavy black hair (though hers is covered by a hijab) and our thick eyebrows. In fact, some have said that the only differences lie in our eyes; mine are green, Dina\u2019s are black. But if you look closely, you\u2019ll notice how big of a head Dina has compared to mine. *Zing*.\n\n\u201cOh, great,\u201d I said, rubbing my temple. \u201cNow I have nerd germs all over me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSays the conspiracy theorist,\u201d Dina scoffed. \u201cYou know why I was waiting out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you have no life?\u201d I held out my hand to Addy for a high five. She was too busy putting a new piece of gum in her mouth to reciprocate it.\n\nDina rolled her eyes. \u201cWell, Seth, that incident in the school walls earlier sparked a lot of questions, so naturally I knew you\u2019d get in trouble with Mr. Penthall while trying to be Sherlock Jr.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I escaped him, didn\u2019t I? Let\u2019s just go to the bus stop, come on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou escaped him *for now*, Seth,\u201d Dina remarked. \u201cWhat happens when you keep skipping classes? Or when you get caught?\u201d\n\nI buried my face in my hands, which I usually do when Dina goes all critic-mode on me. I call it the \u201cDina shield.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, hide from me,\u201d continued Dina. \u201cBut your grades, your future, and the Hassan family name cannot handle this for long. I just want what\u2019s best for you, Seth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have two more years of this nonsense. Chill out,\u201d I said. Hey, I was right, wasn\u2019t I?\n\nDina sighed.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she replied in defeat. \u201cI suppose I can\u2019t make you.\u201d Dina turned to Addy.\n\n\u201cHow are you doing, Adrianne?\u201d asked Dina. \u201cKeeping your grades up?\u201d\n\nAddy responded with a crack of her gum. No, she wasn\u2019t. In fact, she was way worse off than I was, grade-wise. I was doing fine, with mostly B\u2019s. Addy? She was a few wrong test questions and missed homework assignments away from failing. Addy knew she was failing. She wanted to pass, she had told me that, but her mind seemed to always be somewhere else. I have no idea where it was when we entered the bus and sat down.\n\n\u201cAddy,\u201d I called to her. No response. Just her, staring off into space, chewing gum and twiddling her red-brown hair.\n\n\u201cAddy!\u201d I repeated, louder this time. Nope.\n\nAfter a few more attempts to get her attention, I tossed a pencil at her, which flew across the aisle and hit her in the shoulder.\n\n\u201cDude!\u201d she exclaimed. \n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I apologized. \u201cIt worked on the wall!\u201d\n\n\u201cMhm,\u201d said Addy. She picked up the pencil. \u201cI\u2019m keeping this.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse it as a nose plug for all I care,\u201d I chuckled. \u201cListen, peep this.\u201d\n\nI sat next to Addy and checked to make sure nobody was listening.\n\n\u201cI wanna explore that wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made that rather clear,\u201d replied Addy. \u201cThe wall\u2019s cool and all, but that scream\u2026that cough\u2026I don\u2019t know if it would be wise of us to put ourselves in that sort of danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can deal with the logistics later, Addy,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it work somehow. Think; Friday, you and I, after school, exploring whatever\u2019s in there. We got three days to plan. I think we can pull it off if we get enough info.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a heist like that? We better plan a damn lot, Seth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll start tonight! What do you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have work to make up\u2026but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c...But?...\u201d\n\n\u201c...I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t wanna know.\u201d\n\nI high-fived Addy.\n\n\u201cWe got this, you\u2019ll see! This is gonna rock your socks off, Addy, you won\u2019t regret this!\u201d\n\nDina poked her head around to look at us, like the world\u2019s most nosy ostrich. I was freaked out a bit, but I let out a totally calm, manly scream that nobody heard. Totally.\n\nDina shushed me, but I don\u2019t know why, because that scream was, like, really not loud or high-pitched or anything. She overreacts sometimes, I swear.\n\n\u201cYou two are so dead if you think you\u2019re gonna be going into Wheaton High\u2019s walls,\u201d she hissed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you said, you can\u2019t make us do anything,\u201d I whispered back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell Umi if you do. She\u2019ll ground you for a century.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think that scares me? It\u2019ll be worth it,\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? You\u2019d throw away your life for that?\u201d\n\nAddy cut in and leaned close to Dina.\n\n\u201cDina,\u201d she said. \u201cThink about the educational value of this. We would be learning not just about the history of this school through its walls, but pursuing what could potentially be a breakthrough in science. It\u2019s risky, but it\u2019s knowledge, and a good researcher has to take risks for that.\u201d\n\nDina raised her eyebrow above a set of eyes widened with shock. That\u2019s the most she had ever heard Addy say, I bet.\n\n\u201cPlus,\u201d I added, \u201cThis could make a really good college essay, I\u2019m just saying.\u201d\n\nDina looked down as if processing this, and then confidently turned her head upwards.\n\n\u201cYou better not get into any unnecessary trouble, Seth. If you die, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\nI laughed.\n\n\u201cCould you also pick us up afterward? Say we were late because we were getting food or something?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cGod, Seth, you want me to use Baba\u2019s car to pick you up? You know how he is with-\u201d\n\n\u201c-College essay!\u201d I cut in.\n\n\u201cText me when you need me to arrive,\u201d said Dina, then turned back to her seat.\n\nAddy pumped her fist in the air in victory. I made my way back to my seat.\n\nA brown brick house with a chipped green door passed my view, untrimmed vines smothering its windows. A weathered \u201cFOR RENT\u201d sign lay perched on the staircase. I struggled to glance into the windows past the snaking branches and leaves.\n\nA few minutes later, a more polished yellow house entered my vision. A man hammered a new \u201cFOR RENT\u201d sign into the ground. I sighed.\n\nIt took Addy just a few hours to get in contact with someone who knew how to enter the walls; some stoner dude with whom Addy\u2019s cousin was friends. He and his friends used to smoke in an opening in the walls, to avoid being found out. There was a hole in the closet that led to the crawl space inside. The dude even gave Addy photo evidence of the opening, which was incredibly helpful.\n\nAfter confirmation, the next phase was set into motion; inquiry. An email had been sent out regarding the \u201crumors\u201d of the walls on Tuesday night. I remember it mentioning that the situation was being dealt with by the staff at our school. Now, I am not too acquainted with much of the staff here, save one; my chemistry teacher, Mr. Lawrence. He\u2019s the type of person to jump onto desks while teaching us, sending the entire class into hysterics. He\u2019s the type of person to set crap on fire for the sake of learning. He\u2019s the type to be there when you need help with a problem, or you need a shoulder to cry on, or just someone to share your fascination for the world.\n\nMr. Lawrence is the coolest teacher ever. If he were an element, he\u2019d be nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen so cool that you\u2019d freeze up upon touching it, breaking the Leidenfrost effect and smashing into a million pieces like that one girl in a horror movie I pirated.\n\nDuring my lunch period on Wednesday, I made my way to his room, checked to make sure he wasn\u2019t teaching a class and proceeded when I knew it was ok.\n\nMr. Lawrence looked up from a chicken salad he was eating. I didn\u2019t even care that it was lame old unseasoned chicken because he made it look awesome.\n\n\u201cSeth! Hello! How can I help you?\u201d he said through mouthfuls of his bland lunch.\n\nI took a coke out from my pocket, set it on his desk, and slid it towards him.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the walls?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe walls. Whatever was in there, everyone heard it. You heard it. I heard it. And if the staff said it was \u2018taken care of,\u2019 that means they know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d replied Mr. Lawrence, grabbing the drink, \u201cLet\u2019s just say that the walls are of little concern.\u201d\n\nI leaned towards him. \n\n\u201cRight. But what\u2019s in them?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWhen the school said staff, they didn\u2019t mean *staff* staff, Seth. They meant the big cheese. They meant the admins. At least they know I\u2019m not paid enough to get involved.\u201d\n\nRats.\n\n\u201cBut thanks for the cola. I needed a beverage to wash this down,\u201d continued Mr. Lawrence.\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d I said half-heartedly, making my way back to the door. As I placed my hand on the doorknob, Mr. Lawrence spoke again.\n\n\u201cSeth, I know you\u2019re the\u2026inquisitive type of student. You have a lot of questions, and want a lot of answers.\u201d\n\nI turned back to him.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he continued, setting the can on his desk, \u201cdon\u2019t get yourself into trouble. Don\u2019t do anything\u2026unwise. Let the adults handle it.\u201d\n\nI sighed. I hate when cool teachers sound like regular teachers.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of schoolwork, no doubt, Seth. With the school year coming to a close\u2026just, I advise you, keep your priorities clear. Especially for your friend, Adrianne. She\u2019s a good kid, she just seems to be lagging behind a bit.\u201d\n\nWell, Mr. Lawrence was right about one thing. Addy was lagging behind a *lot*. I knew a lot of studying would do her good, but I didn\u2019t know exactly how to help her out. As for his other instructions\u2026\n\n\u201cWill do, Mr. Lawrence,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll give it a rest. Bye.\u201d\n\nBut I never rest. Maybe it was the caffeine or teen rebelliousness or both, but I wasn\u2019t gonna listen.\n\nThe following two nights, Addy and I gathered food, flashlights, batteries, and other equipment that we knew we would need for our venture into the crawl space. Phones charged, backpacks stuffed so heavily I could already feel that midlife scoliosis, we sauntered into Wheaton High on Friday morning with pride behind our unassuming guises. Amongst a crowd of teens who\u2019d attention had been turned to the latest upcoming game or school fight, we were absolutely undetected.\n\nYou know how, when you wait for something you want, it feels like forever, and with something you don\u2019t want, waiting for feels like nothing? What about a mixture of both? Simultaneous fear and excitement create such a warp in one\u2019s perception of time, it feels like you\u2019re on multiple planets in the solar system. Time can either whoosh by or move at a snail\u2019s pace. No in-between. That\u2019s what my Friday was like. Only Mr. Lawrence\u2019s class and texting Addy made time feel normal. By the end of the school day, I didn\u2019t even know if time existed.\n\nOur plan was to wait one hour, when the extracurriculars were occurring, to hang out in the library and avoid suspicion. Addy and I couldn\u2019t talk about what we were about to do, let alone how we felt, but I found some cool sci-fi books that I planned on checking out, and Addy found some comics. It wasn\u2019t all too bad.\n\nThen it was time.\n\nWe said absolutely nothing as our feet made small echoes on the tiled floor, each sound sending a new jolt of fear through my body. Even Addy\u2019s gum-chewing put me on edge. We had to be absolutely sure that we weren\u2019t being followed. Light from outside poured onto the empty hallways, specks of dust floating like glitter under each ray.\n\nThe closet, the supposed gateway, was down the hall from the teacher\u2019s lounge. Addy ceased gum-chewing. We knew we would have to be absolutely quiet if we wanted a chance at getting in. I removed my shoes and signaled for Addy to do the same.\n\nAs we crept towards the door, the booming of heavy footsteps and faint chatter, like someone was talking on the phone, traveled down the hall. That gruff voice was all too familiar for us to keep our cool.\n\nOur creeping turned to skidding as we struggled to make it to the closet before Penthall turned the corner. I tried not to hyperventilate as air escaped me. I heard a loud *THUD* and a *CLATTER* behind me that rang throughout the wing.\n\nAddy had slipped over onto her stomach, her plastic container of gum the cause of the noise. My heart pounding in my ears, I helped her up, backpack and all, and ushered her towards the door. I pressed down on the handle, praise Allah, it turned downwards, and we were in. I silently shut the door behind us and hid behind a shelf, Addy behind some boxes.\n\nThe footsteps got louder. I held my breath.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you back, Ronald,\u201d said Penthall.\n\nTwo foot-shaped shadows moved around beneath a crack in the doorway. I clung to the shelf as the doorknob of the closet turned. A circle of light darted around the closet for a few seconds. Penthall grunted and stepped back out, shutting the door behind him.\n\nAs soon as the footsteps could no longer be heard, air escaped from me like a helium balloon, in fact, I felt like I could deflate right then and there. We could\u2019ve been toast! I turned to Addy. She was curled up like an armadillo beneath heaps of cardboard.\n\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cMy gum,\u201d muttered Addy. \u201cI left my gum out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Addy,\u201d I said, helping her up. \u201cYou can always get more.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no. Penthall saw the container. He\u2019s gonna know I was here.\u201d\n\nI felt my eyes grow big. She was right.\n\n\u201cListen\u2026we can\u2019t change what happened. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t matter if I\u2019m expelled, Seth!!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done much worse than sneak into a closet, and I\u2019m still here. C\u2019mon. Let\u2019s find that door!\u201d\n\nWe put our shoes back on and spread out, scanning the walls for any semblance of a hole. I peaked my head behind the shelf. Then the cabinets. Then the-\n\n\u201cSeth,\u201d called Addy.\n\nShe was by the boxes she hid behind. When she unstacked them, an ovular hole, crumbs of plaster dripping down, entered our view. Beyond was a dark, unexplored nothing. My cheeks widened into a grin, the butterflies in my stomach so vivid that I thought they were gonna fly from my mouth.\n\nI looked at Adrianne. She looked at me. Our shoulders moved up and down, a deep breath before the journey.\n\n\u201cAfter you,\u201d said Addy.\n\nI pulled out my flashlight and set foot into the passageway to the inner workings of Wheaton High School.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was how narrow the crawl space was. I\u2019d say it was about a foot and a half wide. Addy had to walk behind me if both of us wanted to fit in. The crawl space was also dusty, *really* dusty. Not so dusty that it was uninhabitable, but dusty enough that if you were to blow in my face in that area, I would be temporarily blinded, most likely.\n\nI took out my flashlight and scanned the floor. Disintegrating old blunts littered the ground, ash footprints scattered about. I guess the guy who told us about this place wasn\u2019t lying about using it. \n\nThe walls inside the crawl space were rough and chalky in comparison to the crudely-painted yet slick walls on the other side. My red sneakers made a scratching sound against the floor with each step, each new layer of dust on the sole making me regret wearing them a little more. Wooden slabs decked in cobwebs stood above us. *If a spider so much as love-taps me,* I thought, *I will physically implode.*\n\nWe waited about 30 minutes until we actually started talking, to make sure that nobody was around to hear us. The only noticeable detail in the crawl space at that point was just that it was so dusty I could\u2019ve used the dust as a substitute for flour. I could\u2019ve baked all that dust into a cake to give to my sister. We saw a pipe now and then, but nothing more. Despite our luck, I was certain that these walls were not normal.\n\n\u201cAddy?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019ll do after high school?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike with college? Or just in general?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn general,\u201d I said, brushing dust out of my hair.\n\n\u201cProbably make video games or something. That\u2019d be nice,\u201d Addy answered.\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to make games about monsters.\u201d\n\n\u201cMonsters?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cAny monster, any shape or size, can exist because we don\u2019t see them. It\u2019d be fun to brainstorm.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like the unknown? Stuff like that?\u201d I wondered, smiling.\n\n\u201cNot as much as you, it seems,\u201d she replied. \u201cOf course, if I wanna accomplish anything, I\u2019ll have to do better in school.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope you will, Addy.\u201d\n\nAddy jumped fifty feet in the air just then, nearly banging her head on a wooden slab. She cussed, wiping cobwebs from her hair. I cringed as I tried to help her get them out.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she muttered. \u201cJust almost stepped in some crap.\u201d\n\nI shone my flashlight downwards. Sure enough, there were little droplets on the ground. Yuck. Nevertheless, we continued onward.\n\n\u201cYou think Martina was right?\u201d Addy asked after a while.\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout the walls. Do you think raccoons or bats are in here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I replied. \u201cThere was that cough, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, but it could\u2019ve just been an animal control guy. Or maybe a senior, like in Cass\u2019s theory.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cIf it was just that, I hope they liked pencils.\u201d\n\nWe both laughed.\n\n\u201cFor real, though,\u201d I continued, \u201cNo animal could\u2019ve made that noise unless it was a plain old homo sapien. I\u2019m sure of it. That scream was guttural. It was like a horror movie scream, Addy. I\u2019m positive. You gotta believe me-\u201d\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d cut off Addy. \u201cI believe you. Relax.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I said.\n\nNeither of us talked for a few minutes.\n\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m\u2026delusional?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cDelusional?\u201d Addy echoed, perking her head up.\n\n\u201cYou know. Irrational. Outlandish. Bonkers. Crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201c...Is that why you\u2019re so determined to get other people in on your endeavors, Seth?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you that scared of whether people will take you seriously, so much so that you completely disregard any obligations they have?\u201d\n\nI stopped walking.\n\n\u201cWh--I--no, you--how do you know anything about me?!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know enough to be concerned.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about you? What about *your* problems, Addy?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about that.\u201d\n\nMy face grew hot. *What? What is she saying? Is she right?*\n\n\u201cSo what am I to you?! An insecure wimp? Just a ditzy, pipe-dream chasing kid?! For wanting to learn?! Do you think of me like that? Am I like that, Addy?!\u201d\n\n\u201cFigure that out,\u201d continued Addy. \u201cYou\u2019re more worried about being outlandish than catching yourself whenever you actually are. So you wallow in that uncertainty and overanalysis while perpetuating it. You\u2019re not doing yourself any favors with your dependence, Seth.\u201d\n\nI mulled that over for a few moments. I wanted to disagree. I wanted to at least deflect her argument with a snarky comeback or something. That would do nothing. As the dust floated by and the cobwebs clung tighter, I realized that my decision-making had gone too far. If we died or got lost or something, that was entirely on me. I turned to Addy.\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d I said. \u201cAddy\u2026that was stupid of me. I\u2019m sorry. Really. I shouldn\u2019t have led us on this wild goose chase. Irrational or not, I shouldn\u2019t have dragged you along. And I shouldn\u2019t have freaked out like that.\u201d\n\nAddy nodded.\n\n\u201cDo you want to turn back?\u201d I asked.\n\nAddy hesitated, opening her mouth to speak but not saying anything. Then, after a moment:\n\n\u201cNo, actually,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to keep going.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? I mean, I don\u2019t want to-\u201d\n\n\u201c-Because I have to apply myself after this, Seth,\u201d cut off Addy. \u201cI have so much to catch up on, and, well\u2026my dad\u2019s thinking of moving. So if there\u2019s any time I should be having an adventure, it\u2019s now, with my friend.\u201d\n\nI grew cold.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re moving?\u201d I croaked.\n\n\u201cNothing\u2019s certain,\u201d Addy responded. \u201cMy dad\u2019s been getting some calls, really weird calls. He\u2019s not telling me anything, but I hear him yelling over the phone, scared, and then locking himself in his room. I just know something\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nMy throat hurt like someone was holding it over a blowtorch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for my safety, Seth,\u201d continued Addy. \u201cWe can still talk if the move does happen.\u201d\n\nShe walked in ahead of me. By now, she was able to squeeze right by me. In fact, I hadn\u2019t noticed it before, but\u2026\n\n\u201cDid the crawl space get wider?\u201d I asked. \u201cI swear, it got wider, Addy.\u201d\n\nAddy didn\u2019t respond. She had stopped walking. All she did was face away from me.\n\n\u201cAddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeth. Look.\u201d\n\nI walked to her side. The wooden slabs on the ceiling moved upwards, like upside-down stairs, towards a higher ceiling. The crawl space stretched wider inwards, towering shelves taking up most of the area. Countless confiscated items populated the shelves. Vape pods, skateboards, silly bands, and slap bracelets were scattered about, coated in so much dust that they took on a grayish hue.\n\n\u201cMy God,\u201d I gasped, walking slowly, scanning each and every item with my eyes, slapping a slap bracelet against my wrist. A cloud of dust came up from it.\n\n\u201c...Micah would\u2019ve loved this,\u201d whispered Adrianne. \n\nI froze, feeling my throat get hot again. I hadn\u2019t heard that name for ages. It was as if it was forbidden. But there it was, like a rusty, unused bell, ringing once again. That name, *Micah*, was louder than any scream.\n\nI met Micah Sun in the fourth grade. We both wanted to borrow the only *Ripley\u2019s Believe It Or Not* book in the class, so instead of fighting, we shared. We shared everything. Every idea, every story, every theory that populated our minds. It was like I had found a brother. A dopey twin brother, Korean instead of Egyptian, with a broken sense of humor and an oversized Six Flags baseball cap. Micah listened to my theories. He believed in me, as I believed in him. I would give anything to have someone believe as he did. I would make them all see, for Micah and for the unknown, that questioning the world was worth it.\n\nI still remember the last text he had sent me. We were in the 9th grade.\n\n\u201cLol, my mom\u2019s freaking out at someone who\u2019s calling her.\u201d\n\nThen radio silence. The brown brick house he lived in was entirely emptied, for rent. No word from him or his parents. I have no idea what happened.\n\nThe shelves seemed to never end. They expanded into the darkness, forever reaching. Eventually, we found a divider between two sections of the shelf. Something was on the other side. I took a deep breath, stepped forward, shone my flashlight on the other area, and immediately dropped it.\n\n\u201cSeth?\u201d Addy called.\n\nI could hardly hear her. I only pointed my shaking hand at the contents of the shelves. Lined up in neat little rows were jars of skulls. Human skulls. Not monkeys, not cats, not anything else. Humans.\n\nI slowly picked up my flashlight again. Taped to each jar was a label. I zoomed my light in on one of the labels.\n\nMelanie Herschwitz, Class of 2002. 2.4 GPA.\n\nAddy shut her eyes tight and pressed her back against the chalky wall*.*\n\n\u201cWe can turn back,\u201d I reassured her, edging closer. \u201cWe can go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do this,\u201d Addy whispered.\n\nI stepped closer to her, my foot landing in something squishy. I heard it burst beneath my feet. Addy looked down. I anchored my head slowly downwards, trying to keep my eyes from darting away, and lifted my foot up.\n\nOn the floor and my shoe was what once was a rat. Pink mush, crumbly bones, and ruffled fur like lint spread out like an explosion where I had stepped.\n\nI dusted my shirt off, lifted it up to my face, and screamed into it.\n\nWords escaped us after that; what we held in our hands did the talking. Addy held her dad\u2019s hatchet, I held a hammer I nabbed from woodworking class, our sweaty palms making the tools damp. A putrid smell filled our noses, growing stronger with each passing minute. The shelves remained at our side, skulls staring us down though I refused to return eye contact.\n\nThe crawl space was now so wide, I bet fifteen kids could\u2019ve lined up side by side, marching past dead rats and shelves of student skulls and piles of dust\u2026and that horrid smell. God, it was like dog poop but fifty times worse. My eyes actually watered from the stench.\n\nA red metal rectangle in the distance entered the beam from my flashlight. Addy was coughing by this point. I blocked her with my arm.\n\n\u201cAddy,\u201d I choked, \u201cWe really don\u2019t have to do this. No more roping you guys in on my stupid little experiments. You don\u2019t like being here.\u201d\n\nAddy walked past me, opening the red door. I sighed.\n\n\u201cNo going back from here,\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cFine with me,\u201d Adrianne said.\n\nWe went in.\n\nI wish we hadn\u2019t.\n\nThe only light in the room came from an overhead lamp. It shone down onto a girl from my English class. Julia Garcia. Blanketed like she was sleeping, but she wasn\u2019t. Her eyes were wide open, staring at nothing, not blinking. Her purple, bloodied face lay limp on the operating table she was stretched out on. My classmate was dead. Julia Garcia was dead.\n\nTall figures covered in sacks like ghosts lingered against the walls. Each label had a name, a class, a GPA. These faceless names were contorted like pretzels on the ground. At least we knew the source of the smell.\n\nAddy vomited behind me. I did nothing. Nothing at all. Just\u2026stared.\n\nA man in a surgical mask, a cap, and red-coated scrubs came out from a side room. He removed his mask and cap and grabbed a container of chicken salad from a nearby refrigerator. Mr. Lawrence spat out his first mouthful of salad when he finally saw us.\n\n\u201cSeth Hassan\u2026\u201d he stammered. \u201cAdrianne Larson.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?!\u201d I blurted out.\n\n\u201cI thought I told you not to-\u201d\n\n\u201cWHY?! MR. LAWRENCE, WHAT\u2019S GOING ON?! WHAT IS THIS, I--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\u201d\n\n\u201cSeth, Seth,\u201d Mr. Lawrence hushed, setting down his food and approaching me.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch us. Don\u2019t you touch us, you ASSHOLE!\u201d I yelled, swinging my hammer around.\n\n\u201cYou want answers?! You need to calm down!\u201d Mr. Lawrence said sternly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t use that language in a school setting!\u201d\n\nI dropped my hammer in shock. I almost laughed. Sure, my *language* is the problem.\n\n\u201cExplain this,\u201d Addy gagged, still floored from the sight.\n\n\u201cWheaton High School is high-achieving,\u201d said Mr. Lawrence softly. \u201cJust not high-achieving enough. We want what is best for Wheaton. We want grades reaching for the stars. We want *students* that reach for the stars. So, like any good scientist, one must experiment.\u201d\n\n\u201cExperiment?\u201d I uttered shakily.\n\n\u201cWe need to know what is holding the others back,\u201d continued Mr. Lawrence. \u201cWhat separates the winners from the losers. We need to get that data somehow.\u201d\n\nI glanced at Julia.\n\n\u201cThis is for Wheaton, Seth,\u201d said Mr. Lawrence. \u201cIt\u2019s for your teachers, your friends, all of them. This will change everything.\u201d\n\nHe put his hand on my shoulder. I could smell the iron on him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d he whispered.\n\nMr. Lawrence turned to Addy.\n\n\u201cAdrianne,\u201d he said, \u201cHave you been working hard?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to,\u201d Addy stammered. \u201cI will when I get home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you let me clean up, I can give you some tips. I know how much this must mean to you.\u201d\n\nAddy grit her teeth, looking down at the floor. Mr. Lawrence looked down with her.\n\n\u201cOh man,\u201d gasped Mr. Lawrence. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the smell, truly. I vomited when I went in here for the first time too. Gum usually helps. I might have some.\u201d\n\nMr. Lawrence ushered Addy closer to the operating table, searching for something in a cupboard. He whistled a tune as he looked. I crept towards Addy, blood pumping in my ears.\n\nMr. Lawrence then spun around, scalpel held high, which he then dropped as Addy brought her hatchet down into his arm. Lawrence screamed and clutched his wound. Fire gleamed in his eyes as he looked up at us.\n\n\u201cHold still,\u201d he ordered coldly. Lawrence kicked Addy in the gut, sending her to the ground. He picked his scalpel up again as he held Addy down with his foot.\n\nMr. Lawrence smiled at me.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been making great progress in chemistry, Seth. Keep up the good work.\u201d\n\nI clutched my hammer tightly and swung it into Lawrence\u2019s back. He dropped to the floor, scalpel clattering across the room. Blood dripped onto my face from Lawrence\u2019s cut as he lurched forward and grabbed my head, ramming my head into his. The room spun around me, but as my intelligent sister, Dina demonstrated in our worst sibling fights; when in doubt, aim for the groin.\n\nI slammed my knee in between the man\u2019s legs. I then whacked him in the chest with the hammer, sending him backward into the operating table, tipping it over, and crashing to the ground with him and Julia. I\u2019m sorry, Julia.\n\nI pressed my rat-covered shoe to his torso. I hit him with the hammer in his sides. Then his shoulders. Then his arms. Then his stomach. Finally, I tossed the hammer across the room and started pounding on him with my hands.\n\n\u201cHOW DOES IT FEEL, YOU BASTARD?!\u201d I screamed. \u201cIS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?! IS THIS WHAT SCIENCE IS TO YOU?!\u201d\n\nI grabbed the man by the neck and squeezed. I didn\u2019t want to look at his face anymore, so I looked at a cabinet. It had been knocked open by the fall. Inside were backpacks, lunchboxes, a letterman\u2019s jacket, a canteen\u2026and a Six Flags baseball cap, much too big for most people, but as my friend Micah said, \u201cWas a good bargain.\u201d\n\nI stepped away from him, picked up the scalpel, and pointed it at his gut.\n\n\u201cSeth,\u201d murmured the man, \u201cI know you\u2019re mad. It\u2019ll get better.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this what they saw? Is this what Micah saw?\u201d I hissed. \u201c...IS IT?!\u201d\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\u201cKnowing that\u2026it\u2019ll never get better,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI know how much he meant to you.\u201d\n\nI chuckled.\n\n\u201cNo you *fucking* didn\u2019t,\u201d I scoffed.\n\nI helped Addy up, pocketed the scalpel, and walked towards the door.\n\n\u201cSeth,\u201d called out the man.\n\nI turned back.\n\n\u201cHave a nice weekend,\u201d Mr. Lawrence said.\n\nI waved back.\n\nAdrianne and I ran faster than we could\u2019ve ever imagined.\n\nThe dark windows of Wheaton High squeezed us like a deep void. Smooth white brick walls hugged us, blurring our vision with their clutches, making the school a maze. The back entrance called us to it like an escape from hell. As we turned a corner, we bumped right into Penthall, the two of us falling over.\n\n\u201cMr. Penthall, we--\u201d started Addy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d said Mr. Penthall quietly. \u201cGo home. Get some rest.\u201d\n\nHis footsteps clunked loudly away from us. *This isn\u2019t real, this isn\u2019t real, it can\u2019t be real.*\n\nWe sat on the curb a block away from that horrible building, waiting for Dina to pick us up. Crickets sang an ominous melody. Tree branches clawed over our heads like they could\u2019ve snatched us at any moment. Nothing was safe.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said. \u201cWe found out. We know what\u2019s in there now.\u201d\n\nAddy sniffed. I looked down at her. Her face was buried in her hands.\n\n\u201cAddy?\u201d I whispered. \n\nAs soon as I put my hand on her back, the blowtorch to my throat finally took over and I burst into tears. I felt them create tracks in my dust-covered cheeks and fall onto the sidewalk. I struggled to breathe. I cried for Adrianne. I cried for Julia, for Melanie, and for all those other kids. I cried for believing, trusting in someone who caused countless families pain. I cried for him because I wish I understood why he felt he had to do this. And I cried for my dear friend Micah, whom I now knew would never smile, laugh, breathe, wonder again. He was gone forever, like all of them, because they weren\u2019t good enough. The more I thought, the harder I cried.\n\nWhat else could we do?\n\nLights gleamed towards us, like death itself. Addy and I cowered, clutching each other, shutting our eyes. A car horn beeped. We looked up.\n\n\u201cAlright, dweebs, I hope you had a nice little journey. Get in.\u201d sneered Dina.\n\nAs we approached the car, the smirk on Dina\u2019s face faded.\n\n\u201cWhat happened? Are you guys alright?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't trust anything anymore."

                "body": "Hey man, I understand completely. I've felt the same as you do many times, though I don't look at Tiktok, nor does anyone infantilize me or project anything onto me--I don't put up with shit like that, trans or not. Femme and campy trans guys make me feel secondhand dysphoria sometimes. I'm a masculine man, and presentation-wise I have more in common with cishet guys than the majority of trans guys who post online, even though I'm bi.\n\nI'll say three things, in order of increasing importance.\n\nFirst, trans guys flaunting it on social media are a relatively small sample size, and they skew young. Young people are gonna young people, and social media is gonna social media, you know? People like attention, people like copes, and allies like palatable transness because it's easier to accept. All of that points to the more flamboyant among us getting the most attention. But there's trans men of every age, style, personality, and attitude. Don't fall for the social media bubble, it's all an illusion, it doesn't reflect reality. It's the same reason Facebook, Tiktok, and Youtube push everyone towards extremist content--it gets engagement. \"Everyone\" doesn't think of trans men a certain way, most people don't even know we exist. Recognize that you're in a bubble, and you don't have to be.\n\nSecond, these thoughts read to me like intense social dysphoria. Eventually, this will subside to a large extent, until you've managed to build yourself a life in which your identity is unquestioned. Believe me when I say that the more people see you as a man, the stronger you will feel. You will gradually gain the inner stability to actually face and handle the Big Things like bottom dysphoria and wrong childhood, etc. Try not to fixate on the big stuff for now, focus on building that life. It is hard, and it should take most of your focus instead of trying to deal with everything at once.\n\nAnd third, I'm not sure the best way to say this, but be nicer to yourself. You're putting so much pressure on yourself. It takes practice to recognize that you're doing it, but try to remember that it's okay to feel like dogshit, it's okay to hate how you're perceived, it's okay to feel impatient and desperate. It fucking sucks. It just does. And sometimes you have to be your own caregiver, so at least be a gentle one. Sometimes no one else understands, but you do. You don't have to call yourself negative or entitled or offensive just for having normal reactions to the circumstances you're in. Your feelings are all normal and rational considering how objectively stressful things are. Let the feelings happen, do something kind for yourself, and make a plan of action. You've already got some ideas planned, and you've got tons of motivation. You'll do all right.",

I've only been dropped a couple of times after coming out, but honestly I'm not keen on asking for it to keep happening. I had a cis girlfriend who made me feel like a whole man, and that was great, but after we split up I've been gradually realizing I don't need a relationship to affirm me. I can do that by myself.\n\nI'm a pretty quiet, introverted person and I've got a lot going on already, with getting ready to graduate and working on job interviews, etc. I'm going to move this spring to wherever I get work. I don't have the time or emotional bandwidth to date anyone. I got the single lifestyle grind, chasing that money...so I tell myself. \n\nMostly I just don't want anyone to see me. It's a constant ambiguous morass of lonely/not lonely.\n\nIf someone is into me and they know basically what to expect from me, and I'm into them too, sure. I'll go for it. But I'm not wasting my time if I don't chase dates, and I'm not worth any less being single. It's okay to just date yourself if that's what you want.\n\nThanks for reading.

                "body": "I've been active in both book and video game fanfic communities, and I've noticed some differences in how authors tend to portray the world of their respective canons. Books tend to have static lore, established setting rules, and consistent characters. OCs are probably common in every corner of fandom, but in book fandoms I don't see them getting much prestige. Video games, on the other hand, especially game series, can have major lore inconsistencies, wildly varying setting rules, and lots and lots of blank slate characters. OCs are not just common but taken seriously--if the games have character creation. \n\nI'm not so familiar with fanfiction based on story-heavy games like The Witcher, but The Elder Scrolls, which is an RPG series, is very different from novels. This shines through in its fanfiction tropes.\n\nSome things I don't like about that:\n\n* Game-ified story mechanics, like you can just tell the plot is being lifted directly from a playthrough and the author is just barely holding back from rattling off stat numbers.\n* Unoriginal plot elements, like rehashing quest events, sometimes even with zero relevance to the story the author wants to tell.\n* Unrealistic setting scale and travel times, like running across the country in two days. Sorry, I don't believe their journey was so inconsequential that a throwaway line about needing to find an inn will suffice. It's wasted character potential.\n* Murder hobo behavior being whitewashed. The game canon may have enemy factions indiscriminately attacking travelers, but the author couldn't bother to give them a real motivation, let alone explore the psychological impact of killing a mob that assaulted the character.\n\nSome things I appreciate:\n\n* Significant license to pick and choose aspects of lore to include or discard. Don't want a high magic setting? Pick the game lore that doesn't emphasize magic. Want the story world to feel huge? Pick the game lore from the game with the largest map. If the series has any amount of variety, you can claim canon support for all kinds of writing choices. Books that build upon a linear story don't tend to offer so much choice to stay lore-friendly.\n* Blank slate NPCs can be adopted into major characters, even POV characters. NPCs with no unique dialogue in game can become beloved fandom favorites if your version gains traction. This is rare, but I've seen it happen.\n* Maybe I'm just a more visual person, but I appreciate being able to directly see which parts of the game world could use fleshing out. Where does this village get their food from? How did this person get their wealth? A lot is left up to imagination in books, but less so in games. When information is excluded, it's just not there. I get lots of ideas for stories from these gaps.\n\nThoughts on how I try to adapt a video game into fanfiction effectively:\n\n* I'm not interested in portraying the game, but rather the world that the game is also portraying. Games have hardware, funding, and schedule restraints. Fanfiction has none of that, so the world can be deep and interesting as I can dream up. Gameplay restraints like fatigue and negative status effects should be used in the story if and only if they serve the plot and tension.\n* I'm not writing a power fantasy. Power creep is an issue in many stories, especially ones with supernatural elements. This must be managed carefully, and any increase in power must be not only personally significant to the character(s), but also earned via character growth. Alternatively, increases in power should also increase the risks of misusing it. If the character has not learned a lesson yet, misuse is inevitable and devastating. Power for power's sake is rewarding in a game but extremely boring in a written story.\n* Much like screenwriting has different rules from novel writing, fanfic writing has different rules from game writing. Because I don't have the prolific badass stamina of novelists, I try to apply screenwriting rules to my fanfiction. Video games have extremely loose pacing restrictions, and if I wanted to spend 100 hours with a single character, I would just play the game rather than read. Scene and plot structure should be tight. If something doesn't further a) plot, b) character development, or c) atmosphere, it needs to be cut. Ideally as many elements as possible should serve all three at once. Games have visuals and controls to contribute to these things, but fanfics do not. The author must compensate or the writing will fall flat. I've seen too many fics with interesting premises but so little effort towards adaptation that it ends up feeling like I'm reading the captions to a video I can't see.\n\nThese are just my general opinions, and they likely apply to more than just video games. Comic book series also have broad variations in canon interpretations, movie series may have different directors, and book series may also vary significantly from one volume to the next. Likewise, television series have very different pacing rules than novels. I find it super interesting how the difference source materials have such an impact on the practices of fanfic authors they inspire, for better or for worse."

I'm glad I've tried sex with both men and women, otherwise I'd still be waiting to rule anything out. But the buildup was always much better than the main event. I still don't understand actually getting turned on by sex acts themselves outside of fantasies. Can't get into it. Foreplay is always better.\n\nFor a little while after realizing I was probably asexual, I hadn't let go of the anxiety yet, so I felt doomed to \"miss out\" and be forever disappointed and self-conscious about this personal failing I couldn't change. But seeing other men dealing with it has shown me that it's just a natural sexuality like any other, and I couldn't possibly cast judgment on everyone else who is just like me. It truly is okay, and missing out on sex is a lot like missing out on climbing Mt. Everest...which I have even less desire to do.\n\nI can finally just chill.

I'm sorry, I refuse to accept the notion that neopronouns are some stain on the trans community.\n\nI understand if they make you personally uncomfortable, and I'm sorry to hear if anyone has given you shit over it. But the sooner we accept gender experimentation as no big deal, the less we will NEED to associate under this giant queer umbrella at all. We don't need women's suffrage activists in the US anymore, at least not as a distinct political movement. It's the law and common sense now (fundies notwithstanding). I dream of a future in which dysphoric trans people get the treatment they need without resistance, and non-dysphoric genderqueer, GNC, and xenogenders (dysphoric or non-dysphoric) can live their lives freely too. The only reason you might feel threatened by them is because you have to be associated with them, seemingly forgetting that we have to be associated for the time being for protection from people who literally want us all dead, even the cis gays."

I\u2019m not even as close with my old friends, the person I got in a fight in had a valid reason, and the unrequited love thing was supposed to be in lighthearted fun.

I tried binding the other day, and while I found the look it gave my body kinda attractive, it was kinda uncomfortable\u2014both physically and mentally. I go through limbos of being convinced that it\u2019s either OCD or dysphoria, even tho I\u2019ve had a lifetime of experience with OCD rather than dysphoria. I generally identify more with masculinity/androgyny rather than femininity, but I do not see myself as a man. God even typing that feels like denial. What if it is? After years of suffering with this theme on and off, I still ask that same damn question at the end of the day. This theme is truly hell in the every sense of the word."

So how did Reiko manage to lift her curse? \n\nPerhaps the one that Reiko's son Yoichi saw a few days later, the one that he claimed  'Tomo-chan' told him to watch, is the copy. \n\nYou see one might initially find it weird and even cruel that Tomoko's spirit would let her young cousin be inflicted with the curse. After all, Ryuji's spirit after his death was on the helpful side. But maybe she was actually trying to help? Perhaps she could foretell that Reiko might actually be able to figure it all out, and was trying to lead her in the direction of it, all the while buying them more time to break the curse."

Always looking for their benefit and not giving three shits if they hurt you as far as they feel better with themselves or have more chances of getting/get what they want.\n\nI've been told that's how the world works, and It's true because whenever I treat with people, it doesn't matter who, they only give me advice for their own benefit if they can and doesn't put them in a disadvantage place. If it doesn't benefit them then they will say what's needed to try trick me into doing what they want for them.

Being this kind of egotistic is generally good so don't take it in a bad way.\n\nI just can't help it but feel extremely sad.

No one I've met seems to feel the same way.\n\nI don't know how to do it. I've been trying to be more cold-blooded and egotistic with people who deserve it, I've also tried being nicer but having set even firmer and stronger boundaries than before. It's the healthy way, I know and I'm going but I just feel horrible. It's not enough.\n\n People is still horrible, I thought being more strict with what I wanted would help cool it down a bit, I thought it was that they may have taken advantage because I let them do it, but it was not. People keep pushing and being self centered, they keep doing and saying whatever works for them. It doesn't matter who it is, everyone does the same. No one cares about anybody.\n\nThis is how it works, I know it's for survival and I know it's normal and I can't change it and it won't change for me because it's ridiculous to even think that.\n\nBut how can I stop hurting when I feel it's ripping myself appart.

I used to go to some medics when I was younger but no one seemed to come up with an answer so my parents gave up (they didn't care as much neither so they didn't try that much). I got some basic analysis (blood, urine) and that's it but it seems to be something more complicated than that.\n\n Now time has passed and it's not getting worse but it's affecting me more often and making me unable of living a normal life (not as if it didn't before but before I could live a more or less normal life, well, not really but I can try believe it. The thing is that it's  causing me more trouble now.)\n\nI'll probably go to a specialist in a couple of months because I brought the issue up again, but I fear that it won't be enough to discover what I've been having those years.\n\nI write you now because I'm feeling sick again and I'm not sure if I'm scared of going to sleep so I'd rather ask this now that I can. I also feel it's making my life miserable to just accept everything as I've been doing all this time.\n\nSo how do I find what I have. Where can I ask? What can I do? Any advice is appreciated even if I think it's not possible to do.\n\nSorry for writing you such a sad note mom, I have no one I can tell this right now. I wish I could tell you, but I feel I'm living in a loophole having to always try to explain the same concepts I've already told you for you to ignore me and ask them again another day as if you were interested. I can't, it's tearing me appart. I gave up trying long ago but it's fine, I can't change the way you see the world. \n\nWell I think that's it for today. I'll probably go suffer for a couple of hours now and try sleep a bit. Thanks for reading this, it seems it turned more into a vent than in a question but I feel awful. Thanks in advance mom."

In the past this also used to happen if I was more time than needed without eating (around 5-6 hours) now it happens less often and I need more time.\n\n If I go to sleep after feeling this way I'll proceed to awake gasping for air (arround a minute or more) and feeling extremely badly (body sensation). Lately I've been experiencing heart pain for some seconds when I wake up startled like that but since it's more or less recent I'm not sure if it will be relevant. It's very common for me to feel exhausted and weak a couple of days after an episode, I usually feel like shit too, it happens almost all the time. And if it's very severe it will last more days for me to recover and it will feel way worse.\n\nI also had tachycardias (few) and other symptoms that I still have (losing appetite and whenever I'm in the middle of an episode and getting extremely hungry and sleepy afterwards).\n\nI've been taking sugary things to get better when I start feeling badly after doing much exercise, it usually works but need arround 15-20 mins of suffering until it's effective and after that I'm exhausted, sometimes it doesn't even work and I'll have to eat more and wait till I get well enough to sleep without stopping to breathe. My father seems to be suffering from the same thing but we don't know what it is.\n\nI'd really love if some of you could give me a hint of why this is happening as no one seems to know anything about this.

                "body": "Let's get one thing clear. Learning is not studying. And studying doesn't always create learning. Learning is the mental process that occurs and allows you to understand and apply information. Studying is the technique used to try to get you to learn (i.e, taking notes to get the big picture of the topic). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm in 10th grade, I'm taking two AP classes and one honors, and at the beginning of the year I was very overwhelmed. I had to take around 10 pages of notes daily, revise constantly, and still continued to get b's and c's despite wasting hours daily. I didn't enjoy biology even though i loved science, i absolutley despised history and couldn't manage to remember what occured in all of the events let alone the hundreds of dates.\n\nCurrently I'm doing better. And I can only tell you how, why it works, and why if you put in enough effort you can get to a great point in a couple of months too. \n\nLearning (includes remembering, understanding, connections across topics) that doesnt stick is wasted time. Spending hours on \"study\" that you don't remember a week from now is wasted time. \n\nThe way you can get better grades in school is to actually learn how to learn, because most of us students don't.\n\nStudying techniques that have been proven to be ineffective are listed below:\n\n\\--Linear notetaking (righting left to right across the page (this is ineffective because instead of activley reading, asking yourself questions about why something works the way it does, why what you read is imprtont, how it relates to another concept that you learned before hand, you are reading the textbook and immideatly regurgitating it into your notebook). One thing to ask yourself, \"Why should i write this down if it exists in the lecture slides, textbook, teacher video recording, or on the internet?\"\n\nTrust me, its gonna feel weird to not right down everything a teacher says and instead write down the main idea or key points. Learning is not rewriting information (or even, rewriting in a parahrased way) learning is taking that information, trying to relate it to as many things as possible, connect it to real world things or ideas, and activley trying to understand why its important and how it fits into the main idea.\n\n\\-- Rereading, (you shouldn't have to reread something unless you didn't fully understand it, make connections, figure out its importance, etc).\n\n\\-- Highlighting (Why do we highlight? To find main ideas and then go back to them later. Why would we go back later if instead we can instead properly learn that idea and not have to come back?\n\nEvery thing I'm talking about is better explained in two videos, search up **justin sung on youtube** and watch 1. **5 Techniques of every successful student** and 2. **Study more effeciently with 2 basic steps.**\n\nMy main point is, the techniques most students learn in elementry school (rereading, highloght, memorize) are ineffective for learning and waste lots of time when you reach late highschool and early uni years. The reason for this is that little actual learning is occuring. Actual learning is hard (cognitive load), it feels like a literal pressure in your brain. Real learning is confusing, leads you to ask different questions to get better understanding of an idea. Real learning takes time when you're starting but later you stop needing to constantly \"relearn\"/\"restudy\" things.\n\nAlso, instead of relying on motivation to study you should set a specific amount of time every day (maybe excluding weekeds or holidays) that you're going to make time to study.\n\n**TL:DR, Studying doesn't create real learning, real learning is inquiry based (questions, connections) and not taking notes in a way that you're just rewriting whats in a textbook. Watch Justin Sungs videos on youtube to get a better explanation and maybe private messege me so i can tell you how i do it.**",

Very importantly, because records and reports now pile up faster than humans can organize them, the difficulty of timely enquiry and retrieval for anything in greater depth than casual headline skimming is increasing... possibly exponentially. \n\nA trick among others is separating out the boilerplate copy and deducing what conclusions were left as exercises for readers familiar with the field.  That's why more such research is going to continue being performed, period.\n\n\nIf a tool can identify the equivalent of blind alleys in medical research, or summarize the once well-known dangers of a possible medication that have been buried under \"last five years\" syndrome before a derivative goes to human trials, I don't mind not having my latest fanfic get pushed to the bottom of the slush pile.",

Should I simply invite such understanding?\n\nYou're familiar with the idea that there's more than one valid personality among humans?  Not sarcasm.  Some folks are literally unaware that other people have any business thinking or acting differently from themselves.\n\nI'm in the habit of including personality types in my character designs.  Jungian or astrological archetypes, enneagram, four temperaments, etc., can also be used as a framework for working out how a character is most likely to inhabit their world, and how well that works out.  If nothing else, it saves me the effort of angsting over \"How do I make my MC relatable and likeable ~~so everyone will like me~~?\" or \"How far can  ~~I~~ (oops)  *my character* go to the darkside for cheap thrills and still be redeemable?\"\n\nTraumatic backstories usually call for some research into the lingering damage that can be left behind in a person's behavior.  But, keep in mind that genre fiction may include mechanics that favor a person coming out alive when in reality that trauma results in severe losses of function.\n\nUnless your character is for a short story due by COB Friday, write some scenes with them doing what they would do, not what you would.  For example, one of my MCs only buys his own and then hides his candy from everyone.  You might not think it significant, most of my readers don't, but someone out there is saying \"Oh, shit.  I know how that gets started.\"\n\nSo, stuff like that.",

Sure, it won't make the for the biggest impact for everyone, especially since it was an experimental concept, but it still hit home with me. I really enjoyed the be yourself and stay different, and the choreography and UNIQUE vocals and sounds always kept me on my toes. Icy gave a similar vibe, except it followed a more summery concept and included more of a melodic pre-chorus, which I felt like was more emphasized than Dalla Dalla's pre-chorus. The choreography and music video were especially unique and gave a new light that I've never seen done right in Kpop. The way it was promoted felt extremely personal, with the pajama dance practice and fun smiles that were shared from a light-hearted, but impactful comeback.\n\nNow, when Wannabe was released, I quite enjoyed it. The music video felt nostalgic and brought a poppy-disco vibe, and the storyline in the music video made me appreciate it too. However after many weeks upon months of listening to it, I COULDNT STAND IT. And this isn't Itzy's fault at all. In fact I blame it on JYP for creating a track, that tricks you into loving it, and then dropping it by making it repetitive and taking the promotions WAY too seriously. The promotions did not feel fun, they didn't give the ITZY vibe, I couldn't connect with the members because I felt like the song overshadowed the group itself. Itzy became known for that song, and that song alone. Also, the amount of people who constantly put the song on social media to the point where I couldn't turn on my phone without hearing it, annoyed me so much. I was hoping that ITZY would redeem themselves for me, including the fact that the song itself is great.\n\nNot Shy was catchy, had a great concept, and was executed almost perfectly. It wasn't as popular compared to their old concepts, however the impact it left was remembered. The only thing that would make it better for me would be if it was more lighthearted, just like Dalla Dalla and Icy. \n\nIn the morning was great, and I appreciate the fun that came along with the extremely creative concept. The song has stability and is catchy, but something feels missing. I'm still trying to figure this one out, so I won't speak on it too much.\n\nDalla Dalla & Icy & (maybe In the Morning) > Modern Itzy\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nb6aav)"

As you can see from their fancams, dance practices, and pre-debut dances, they all exceed my decent expectations of being a good dancer. However I have been comtemplating recently about the main dancer role in Everglow specifically.\n\nMia and E:U are the official main dancers in Everglow, while Yiren and Onda are considered the lead dancers. I would be okay with this but I have definitely seen some very interesting predebut videos online of E:U dancing, and I can't lie, they are very entertaining and impressive, even as someone with her height, she continues to serve as one of the best pop dancers.\n\nHowever, it is fierce competition in 4th generation K-Pop, and since Adi\u00f3s Era, I haven't been able to see any improvements in E:U's dancing compared to other members who I have seen grow so much since debut like Aisha and Onda. Oftentimes when I watch a fancam, I see E:U trying her very hardest but she may not bend her knees at the same time as others, or her arms won't be fully extended when everyone else has already. And I don't know her situation of if she has a problem with her arms or legs, or if she is very tired, because then she should rest up and take it easy (just like Itzy's Lia).\n\nE:U hasn't improved since debut in my opinion and I haven't seen her move the same way as Aisha and Onda in recent relay dances and I believe that she deserves the role as lead dancer in Everglow, along with being the Leader and Main Rapper. I also believe that Aisha deserves main dancer because she has improved immensely since Bon Bon Chocolat and I can't notice any half hearted moves when she dances while sometimes I see E:U hesitate before moving.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading this Unpopular Opinion. I know that its Unpopular because I see her often get lots of praise for her dancing, and I believe she is good, but she hasn't kept up with the other members as I see growth in every other member but her. So long everyone, stan Everglow ot6.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/j0a8dz)"

Have to copy my comment, reload, find the right place in the thread and post again\n\n2) Now if I just post right away, someone either nothing happens (disabled post button) or it appears to post but doesn\u2019t site in the thread (this has resulted in some double posts)\n\n3) Notifications are broken in browser. I seem to remember those working better, so again it seems like a regression\n\nOverall they should be pulling people to the app not degrading the website to push people. It feels like someone at Reddit misunderstood Netflixes chaos monkeys and created one that randomly rips out features.\n\nEdit: my single biggest problem with the app (beyond not wanting to be pushed to use it) is infinite scrolling.

My dog is 50 lbs and she's the biggest in the neighborhood. When we walk, apparently her size sets off several dogs we pass. I've had two small dogs in the apartment complex charge her, attempting to approach her from the rear (one was a dog the size of a large potato and to color of a marshmallow). Fortunately she's older and well trained so she ignored the attacking dogs.\n\nRelated questions: why do people let their dogs out without leashes and not pick up their dogs poop? I see that less, but have a next door neighbor who does that.\n\nSide note: if anyone has a dog that barks a lot I'm glad to share tips (trained a service dog and had to go through training myself). A key tip is to use positive reinforement (reward and praise when they don't bark) and never yell when they bark (they see it as barking and interpret it as encouragement) and needless to say, don't hit them."

Sappho was born in the city Mytilene, capital of the island of Lesbos. Her precise lifespan is unknown. She seems to have primarily stayed on her own island, although she may have been exiled briefly to Sicily for unknown reasons during the reign of the tyrant Pittacus in the 580s. Of her original nine books of poetry and songs, only one complete poem and a few dozen fragments currently survive, although new fragments have been found in Egyptian papyri within the past few decades.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Sappho competed in poetic festivals against her fellow lesbian poet Alcaeus; she also may have been romantically involved with him. She wrote romantic and erotic poetry to numerous women, in particular Atthis, Dica, and Anoctoria. Whether these women were her physical lovers or merely the recipients of platonic sentiments is still a debated question. \n\nIn the last thirty years, a theory that her poems were wistful expression of happiness at the upcoming marriages of those women rather than an erotic intent has been somewhat discredited, partially because the discussion of lesbianism, a term inspired partially by Sappho herself, has become more socially acceptable in Western culture. Most modern critics believe that Sappho did have loving, probably physical relationships with a number of young women; she also had sexual relations with some men or at least with the father of her chid.\n\nIn her poems, Sappho touched on many themes but focused on love in its various forms: the love of a worshipper for her goddess, Aphrodite, and a goddess for her worshipper, the love of a mother for her daughter, the love of bride and groom, and finally the love of one woman for another. She used vivid imagery of fruit, flowers, and other natural objects. Sappho deliberately denigrates conventional Homeric poetic metaphors of war and battle such as those often employed by Alcaeus \\[cmccormick: her main rival in poetic contests, which sound a little like ancient rap battles\\].\n\nWhile Sappho enjoyed a high reputation as the \"Tenth Muse\" in the classical and Hellenistic eras, her personal life and the erotic nature of her poetry was harshly criticized in the later Roman empire and by early Christian writers, resulting in the loss of most of her work. In the last fifty years, scholarly interest in Sappho has resurged along with increased interest in and tolerance for female same-sex desire.\n\nFurther reading: Making Silence Speak.

A summarized version of her entry in the excellent Encyclopedia of Love, Courtship and Sexuality. \n\nAspasia of Miletus was perhaps the most famous Greek hetaira, or courtesan, in the ancient world. Aspasia was purportedly the long-term mistress of Athens's leader Pericles, a madam of a brothel, a philosopher, a matchmaker, a teacher of Socrates, and an instigator of war. As a symbol of the potential power available to elite Greek prostitutes, she become a focus of attention about the intersection between sexuality, philosophy, and politics.\n\nConsiderable factual information as well as many improbable tales survive about Aspasia. According to Plutarch, Aspasia aspired to imitate the example of Thargelia of Miletus, a legendary courtesan who married or was involved with Antiochus, the ruler of Thessaly. Thargelia was not only beautiful, but she was also a political strategist who convinced both Antiochus and her thirteen other lovers to become allies of Persia. In some accounts, Thargelia is even said to have ruled Thessaly itself after Antiochus's death and to have met Xerxes, the king of Persia. Aspasia followed in a tradition of Miletan women how used their bodies in order to achieve political influence and power.\n\nAspasia, a woman renowned as a courtesan, is never praised for her physical beauty by the contemporary sources, even though they tended to eulogize most women as beautiful. One sculpture, labeled \"Aspasia,\" portrays an ordinary, solemn woman with a strong jaw and an elaborate \"melon\" hairstyle. Plutarch claims that Pericles adored Aspasia for her political skill, rather than her beauty. Ancient sources describe the relationship as one of deep love.\n\nShe appears in several philosophical dialogues as an acquaintance of Socrates, where she is represented as a matchmaker, a teacher of eloquence, and an advisor of Athenian matrons. The most famous of these dialogues, Plato's Menexenus, relates a conversation in which Socrates claims to have been taught the art of persuasive oratory by Aspasia, who he describes as a formal teacher of rhetoric. Aspasia is also presented as intellectual and as a gifted speaker. In another philosophical conversation, Aspaia performs the function of the Socratic interlocutor in proving to a couple that to have the best spouse, one must first be the best spouse. Aspasia is elsewhere described by both Aeschines and Xenophon himself as a teacher of rhetoric, a philosopher of gender and sexuality, a matchmaker, and a marriage counsler of sorts.\n\nThe philosophers were not united in their praise of Aspasia as a philosopher and teacher. Antisthenses, a notable anti-Periclean follower of Socrates, criticizes Aspaasia for her sexuality and her relationship with and influence over Pericles. Antisthenes stressed that virtue came from within and could not be taught and he would have strongly criticized Aspasia's view that eros, physical love, could lead to arete, or virtue. Aspasia's exaltation of loving relationships would have been antithetical to his philosophy.\n\nAfter Pericles's death, Aspasia married Lysicles, the sheep-dealer. According to Plutarch, Aspasia taught this man rhetoric so well that he became a major politician. In this case, the normal situation of a woman's achieving indirect power through her influence over a male relative is reversed."

I was kinda trying to focus on both. \n\nThis didn't bother me at first. I felt like I was doing fine, but when I read about meditation techniques, they say you should bring your focus back to the breath. \n\nSo, in essence what I'm asking is, what do I do if there's a thought that is important to me?"

I've been wanting to bring up the issue of gender identity, as I believe I may be a mtf transgender. Currently, I identify as a gay male, but I know that this isn't right. \n\nUnfortunately, I'm pretty broke, so my Nana kindly offered to pay for me to see a counsellor. \n\nWhen we were looking for a counsellor, we looked at many options. I tried to suggest that I see an LGBT counsellor. However, she dismissed the idea, because she said that I didn't seem to need support with being gay (about which she has been really supportive btw \ud83d\ude01). I then was stuck with seeing a non LGBT counsellor. I picked a female counsellor because I find it easier to talk to and relate with women. \n\nShe has really been helpful with some of my other issues, which I hadn't fully realised I had (low self-esteem and social anxiety), so I'm so glad that I have been to see her. \n\nSo far though, I've avoided bringing up the gender identity issue for two reasons. \n\nFirstly, I'm yet to say it out loud. I feel really scared to do so, because I feel like once I do, it becomes real. It becomes an issue that will define my life, and I don't think I'm ready for that. My Dad would almost certainly disown me. I guess it just seems like a step towards actually transitioning and I am terrified. \n\nSecondly, I feel as though there's a high chance of her trying to transfer me to someone who specialises in gender identity... At this point, what do I tell my family. Will I be forced to come out? What would I tell my Nana, who's paying for my therapy? \n\nI feel totally stuck. I have no idea how to approach this. I was wondering if anyone would have any advice or useful information?"

I would be 23 when I complete counsellor training. People seem to say that you should be older to go into counselling. I personally don't understand why. They argue that older clients won't want to confide in someone who's young, but I argue that younger clients would feel more comfortable talking to a younger counsellor. \n\nI was wondering if you could give me any advice.

Eucalyptus is horrible for cats. I tend to stay away from certain oils or scents in body products too since I touch the cats often etc etc \n\n-if burn incense / candles often, have stale air etc please get an air purifier. I\u2019d be happy to share details on the one I have \u2014 I just pop a new filter in when the light goes red but keep it on all the time. \n\n- I use cedar pellets instead of litter which is awesome bc it keeps the air cleaner, prevents litter ending up in your couch/bed/on the floors, and it\u2019s also just so easy. I dump out the full trays every couple days and you can just spot clean the poops when they happen. \n\n- avoid feeding your cats any human food unless you look it up. Salt = especially bad. I have a cat that stole a goldfish years ago and still wakes up from a nap if I eat any...save yourself! \n\n- try feeding the majority of their food as wet food, if you can. Later in life cats can and often tend to run into health issues, often kidney-related. Wet is just a bit better than dry food that can have more fillers and carbs  \n\n-when this animal inevitably starts to steal your spot and sleep in it like the angel they are, you\u2019re going to dislike this after a bit. How do you get your spot back?  Lay throw blankets where you want seat savers and pull the entire blanket over when it\u2019s your turn to take the spot. \n\nIdk I think that\u2019s about it.

There are a few colors in there that I think would be awesome on you (and all the other more bold ones are also great occasionally). Favorite palette ever \n\nAs for hair, people have added their curly routines, and I can\u2019t exactly tell your natural texture, but by the coiling I can see you may benefit from the below notes. \n\n-get a good wet hair brush to detangle after showers and start from the bottom of the hair, working your way up. You lose less hair this way. I was every 4 days about, and use mainly Shea moisture or Carols Daughter products (sometimes Cantu for a cheaper drug store brand\u2014their leave in works well for me). \n\n-section your hair (if you\u2019re pressed for time or even if this just works well for you, I separate midway). Once you work in leave in, then a curl cream, brush through and use a different, more tightly spiked brush to brush smaller sections out slowly \u2014 I use an Evolve brand brush from cvs and it does the trick. Just slowly pull away from you, and wrap the smaller section a couple times around the brush as you go. \n\n-once you do the above steps, scrunch, use fingers by the roots to add volume (curly hair is hard bc you shouldn\u2019t just run your fingers through it as much). I\u2019ll piece apart sections by hand while it\u2019s still wet to separate larger coils which will add volume to your curls once dry. \n\n-if you blow dry, use a cool setting. The key is the keep moisture IN your hair vs use heat and dry it out. \n\nThis all works well for me. If I need to leave the house while it\u2019s still damp, I use salon clips that won\u2019t dent my hair and pop it in a beanie so it can benefit from the natural head heat and this helps rule out excess frizz. \n\nHope something here is helpful!!",

First time poster that has wanted a tattoo for over half my life and is finally bored enough with how I overthink to just go for it. \n\nI\u2019ve had a huge idea based off a Frank Stella painting that I\u2019ll likely come back for advisement on, but want to just start small(er) for now.  \n\nI love surrealist, cubist, impressionist, and trash polka styles. I have a smaller idea that I\u2019d like to possibly get while visiting SD in early/mid-December. I\u2019ve done searches for artists there recently, but haven\u2019t found anyone so far that seems like they specialize in this sort of style, so I hope to gain some ideas for shops/ artists to check out if anyone could help point me in new directions. I do realize this may be too close to get an appointment, but hey figured I\u2019d give it a go.  As a newb, I am here to be taught and won\u2019t take it personally if this request will not be achievable with this visit to SD. \n\nI\u2019ll share the general idea for this tat to help make clearer what I\u2019m looking for (which I\u2019m very open to ideas about, but that\u2019s secondary to the resource request as I don\u2019t want to ask too much). \n\nPlacement I\u2019m thinking is upper forearm, and the scene would be an outdoor projector screen with a cubist/surreal styled scene (as of now thinking of a golden / interestingly-colored octopus doing some weird shit, perhaps holding off things, taking over a city like Godzilla....clearly, I\u2019m very open). The crowd would be visible, but you\u2019d only see the backs of their heads (could be a couple turned around to add to the fun, though). There\u2019s room to play for oddities, background given its outdoors.  Really, I want to capture an absurdist scene in the styles of art I like. I think some sort of text could be at the bottom to \u201cname\u201d the film / show a pamphlet for it etc and that could be more in the trash polka wheelhouse. \n\nOk, I\u2019ve added more detail than originally planned. Thanks in advance to anyone with ideas!  The...obscurity of my tastes makes the searching a bit confusing on my end, so any help will be appreciated."

                "body": "(Boston, MA) I'm going to try to keep this short, but honestly that'll be tough (be ready to watch me fail at being succinct; apologies). \n\nBasically, since moving in September, the new apartment has required over 30 maintenance calls, things like:\nhot water;\ndoors being broken;\ndead rats, rat issues with outside area;\nfire alarms going off randomly for over an hour-and one of us has epilepsy-;\nmouse holes;\nnon-operational AC system;\nno working laundry system even though part of amenities)\n\nMost of these issues have been fixed and/or are ongoing, but the amount of calls and repeat calls has been very high (#>35). \n\nThe most recent issue is probably the most illegal one we've had (except when our rear exit wasn't up to code), which is that our hot water keeps quitting for days at a time. One of us works from home, and I have animals, so the excessive maintenance calls are really an issue and we are losing energy and money every other call we have to make. They are responsive to our issues, but at this point have probably tripled the amount of work by not doing things properly the first time (or second). \n\nFor perspective, this is the second time our hot water isn't working in two weeks and it hasn't worked since Sunday. The kicker?  The third plumber who has been to service our units heater in the last 3 days just informed us that the heater (which was replaced two weeks ago, last time we had these issues and called the emergency maintenance line, had three different maintenance calls to complete) was ACTUALLY replaced for the apartment above us.  Yup, those elephant-footed troglodytes got a new water heater when theirs worked perfectly fine (or at least, they didn't have to call the emergency line).  \n\nWe now have to be home for another potentially all day maintenance call to fix an issue we brought to the landlords attention weeks ago.  I should probably mention that this sort of mix up seems common with this company: woke up to a stove on our back porch (for upstairs apartment), work order said our unit, so the maintenance guy just asks if we want a new stove since its there (didn't take him up on it because...what?). \n\nHow do we (or is it possible to) get compensated for not only lost workdays (for the work from home person who now is looking at the third day of interrupted working hours and helping the maintenance man by testing the water constantly while he's in the basement), but also (and I'm not kidding) mental distress. \n\nWe have no reason to believe that we won't continue to need maintenance calls for the foreseeable future given how many we have had even in the last month (more than 5). We have averaged one maintenance call a week (2-3 for a couple months in the beginning), and not for nothing but on move in day the apartment was not ready for new tenants: there was a serious fruit fly problem from a party the previous tenants threw (and literally made jungle juice for that I found, opened and festering, a month later), the walls were filthy and needed to be painted (we did the actual painting, company got the paint), and we needed to take out trash in order to be able to move in. I also had to have things fixed (bare nails, etc) before I could move my animals in (and they're formally on the lease). Even though I couldn't safely move them in for half the month, I wasn't able to have the \"cat fee\" taken off rent, so at this point I need to reach outside my own circle to see if anyone has some good ideas. \n\nI'm at the point where I dread going home and this post is admittedly pretty desperate: I'm getting to my wit's end and have not able to consistently enjoy peaceful use of my apartment (tomorrow is my birthday, but now looks like it's day three of maintenance and I couldn't give less of a shit about getting older when I generally just feel like punching a wall or keeling over once I hear about what's new with the maintenance on our apartment).  \n\nGetting out of work to have my roommates tell me our water heater was never actually replaced isn't completely surprising, and that's part of why I'm posting here for the first time.  \n\nAdvanced apologies for whatever I may be doing wrong; I'm super desperate and feeling pretty much like giving up with this situation but I can't because my animals need to live in a place that isn't full of maintenance issues/is peaceful and has heat and hot water. Im writing this on the my commute home so that I might be able to enjoy some time at home tonight with my fluff boys (and not have it ALL be negative feels), but I'll definitely check back often in case any of you out there can be of any sort of help. \n\nI know that these conditions, long term, are illegal, but if I have hot water technically then not for days at a time consistently, what do I do (or situations similar)?  How do I recoup the more losses of a million little maintenance calls that on their own may not be so bad but as a whole are incredibly taxing (me and one other roommate have been there for at least 20 calls each).   \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and sorry for whatever info is unnecessary (definitely some).  I really don't feel confrontational after months of basically arguing our needs with the property manager and telling her how nonsensical a lot of these issues are becoming (trash keeps getting taken out at 6am, consistently, and I think that breaches Boston Municipal Code). That said, I know this situation isn't just and we are hating living here so much (and it's clearly due to issues on their side), so I want to figure something out. \n\ntl;dr: roommates and I at our wit's end with amount of maintenance calls and repeated issues with necessities and/or amenities provided with the apartment like laundry. Wondering how tenants may try to recoup losses for excessive maintenance needs, visits due to assigning someone in-company rather than an expert (electrician...), lost work days if work from home. \n\nEdit: added summary; grammar and formatting edits. Thanks guys! "

Today I had a dream and kept screaming at the top of my lungs that I was in my dr and affirming things and nothing happened, and this wasnt the first time Ive tried this. I also try the raven and rain method and gotten symptoms but nothing ends up happening , I take breaks, visualize, also detaching myself from my dr for weeks and nothing is happening and am honestly feeling hopeless and crying rn cuz I really wanna go to my dr.

It was as if it was yesterday when I was impaled, and it was an utter pleasure .\n\nAs tradition demands, a man must lay with his wife on the first night after marriage.\n\nWe've been planning this special day as teenagers, and I held to my virginity for I love the man whom I'll soon become part of.\n\nUnder the stars, we've talked about the wedding night, and he has told me how he'll ravage me like a monster.\n\nDespite how erotic and aroused he sounded, we exercised discipline and remained virgins.\n\nTogether, we've been for 3 years, without having to devour the other no matter how monstrous the hormones rage.\n\nThat night, my wedding night, the man I know was no longer the same. He has paid my price, and now he owns me.\n\nAs he climbs the bed to meet me, the subtle candle flames sway in harmony. The room was darkly lit, with slow melodic sounds emanating from the wall speakers\n\nHe looked at me like a predator would to a prey. Unbuckling his belt, as he drools and looks at me with piercing eyes.\n\nI shiver in coldness, trying to retreat farther into the edge of the bed. But he approached while throwing his pants away to the air.\n\nHe grabbed my ankle, pulling me toward him. My hole was already excited, itchy, and slippery from years of desires and wants\n\nThe walls of my slippery organ were already clamping on each other in hunger. Though I struggled to move away, my womanhood desired him.\n\nFinally, his organ becomes exposed to my sight, and for the first time in our 3 years of relationship, I saw a part of him that has laid hidden behind his numerous bulges.\n\nThe sight of his gigantic organ drew me, and the scent of his manliness intoxicated my very essence, as my hole spews more fluids in anticipation.\n\nHe pulled my gown, and off it went, as if he has been practicing. He grabbed my two legs, as I grab the bed sheet in resistance.\n\nI wasn't resisting his defilement, but the intense pleasure that awaits me for I fear it may overwhelm me.\n\nHe grabbed my legs, spreading them eagle wide as his organ poke against my clitoris.\n\nHis organ oozed of precum and meeting my already wet organ offered him an advantage.\n\nI felt it break an edge, as it slides deeper into my being as an unexplainable moan escaped my lips.\n\nBittersweet was the word, and Impaled I was, onto this Mandigo as his organ made way into my hole.\n\nThere was pain, for he has broken my hymen, but the pleasure that followed the pain soon overshadowed my mind.\n\nIt was like a serpent, finally gaining entry into a hole that has been forbidden for generations.\n\nSuddenly, he stopped and looked at me with hungry eyes. Then he looked at the firm bobbies in front of him.\n\nHe gave another devilish smile, as he grabbed them as a child would to a new shiny toy.\n\nThe way he desired and dominated me sent my head spinning. He gropped my melons, with his thick fat organ ravaging my hole beneath.\n\nAs he thrust into my opening with heavy strokes, I could feel the friction creating an electric charge, as waves and waves of pleasure overthrow my sanity.\n\nIf our bodies were mechanical, it would have been a power surge.\n\nHis organ was brushing the walls of my entrance, and it swallows and expel with so much hunger and desire.\n\nMoaning was music, and the wetness of our organs never stopped. I held unto his butt, urging him deeper into my being as if to devour him.\n\nHow can a being be this pleasurable?\n\nSuddenly our eyes locked, and his lips began to devour mine.\n\nHe never cared for the lips before, for it has been exposed since my years of knowing him. He has also tasted it many times. But now, what holds his fancy was my wet hallow\n\nHe was making me a woman, and there was nothing I had desired most in life, if not to have his seeds inside of me.\n\nI wanted to have him in me, not just his thick and erect organ, but a part of his being.\n\nNow I understand what it means to feel the urge of a woman, a need to create life.\n\n\"Give me a baby!\" I moaned subtly, as he kept thrusting to and fro into my being like a stallion.\n\nI began to whine my hips to meet his thrust, and the train took a darker route as our desires intensifies.\n\nAs we both pound on each other, impaled and in heaven, he started grunting as heavy fluids spew inside of me.\n\nI felt it pulsating, as the walls of my well clamped and milked him of his very last essence.\n\nThe seed he has given me, as he thrust his last and slump beside me.\n\nThe thought of how my being has been ravaged sent me to the edge and I started squirting and convulsing from the pleasure.\n\nHow strange it was, to reach such a climax with just thoughts and imagery. It is not every day that you meet a man, who matches your level of intelligence and sexual prowess.\n\nThat wedding night, he made me a woman, and I still beam with smiles each time I recall that precious moment.\n\nIt was also the night I lost my virginity, and the bedsheet testified through the blood-stains resulting from my broken hymen.\n\nHe never really cared about virginity, but it made him proud, to the extent of telling all his friends on WhatsApp that his wife is a virgin.\n\nAs weird as it sounds, he even sent them pictures of the bed stains. Virginity, to him, meant he could trust me with his life, and I was glad to have that trust.\n\nDear married reddit women, how was your wedding night?\n\nFact: Fiction, and I'm Male \ud83d\ude06"

Side B is an aerial command grab with really good reward if it connects so its a great way to get % in if people keep shielding your attacks. Trading with attacks from above with grounded up B is a good way of netting an aerial. One of Bowser's strengths is his really good ledge options so getting people offstage to rinse-repeat edge-guard for more % or kill is a priority. Up B in general is just a really good move too; incredibly fast coming out, kills, you can cancel it into a ledgegrab etc. Fair is the safest aerial you have, its pretty quick and has great knockback. You want to do aerials falling from a platform rather than from jumping \\*if\\* possible. This gets around Bowser's miserable 8 frame jump-squat and lets you get your better moves like fair out substantially faster.",

In the case of metals, the surface free energy is high due to strong metallic bonds between the metal atoms. In polymers, the molecular forces are typically much weaker and thus the surface free energy of the polymers is low. \"\n\nWhich is fine except that it doesn't explain why PTFE has a lower surface free energy than something like polyethene which has the same structure except C-H bonds in place of the stronger C-F bonds in PTFE.\n\nIf anyone knows I'd be very appreciative."

I am essentially someone born into the world as a blank slate, forged by the silver spoon in my mouth that has transformed me into someone that I despise.\n\nI hate my egotistical mind, one that gets pleasure from even the conception that I am smarter, more creative, more special than anyone. And how does this mind reveal itself? It doesn't. It crawls back into the depths of the ocean it's surrounded by, cursed with the everlasting superiority it believes itself to be.\n\nHowever, with pleasure comes pain. If someone even shows the slightest inclination that it might be human, I despise it immediately. It becomes my new inferior subject. AND I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW LONG IT FESTERS. IT BECOMES ROOTED INTO MY BEING LIKE A PYTHON SQUEEZING ITS PREY WITH ALL ITS FUCKING POWER.\n\nJealousy. That's all."

We connected passionately a year ago, and although he has had a very difficult time with his emotional state, he pushed through and started getting some more connections recently. Slowly but surely, he's becoming more healthy and healing himself.\n\nSame can't be said for me. I find myself in a constant state of misanthropy, despising the thought of \"connection.\" I'm becoming more neurotic, more shy, more reserved, more unmotivated. I'm finding less words to describe what I'm feeling, because I truly feel like I'm becoming numb.\n\ncerebral numbness.\n\nI have a philosophy. Essentially, its just the golden rule. I ask myself whenever I act, \"would I want this to happen to me.\" Every single time, I use this excuse to not act; to continue to live in the tomb of the heart, beating faster and faster with every waking second. I don't know how much longer I can push these feelings under.\n\nHave I truly lost myself? Who was I to begin with? Who am I now?\n\nI'm a walking corpse at this point, or I guess I always have been.\n\nI have so much pent up anger and sadness, and nothing anyone will say will ever penetrate this Trojan Horse. My goal is to die with it and bury it alongside my soul. This is partially because I dont know how to release those feelings, but also because I will never put those onto others, no matter what.\n\nMy only and dearest friend, grab the vines and heave yourself up, far away from this swamp."

For context, I'm 17M and living in the U.S.\n\nI was always a pretty shy kid, but was always befriending people I liked to hang out with, and I eventually made a lot of friends. Around 8th grade I started to become more introverted and started to have suicidal thoughts. I've thought about as to why a lot over the past couple years, and I literally cannot pinpoint it.\n\nAnyways, I just became super self conscious and negative about everything since then. I don't have many friends, and the only ones I talk to have mental health problems. My main goal in life is to lessen the pain of people around me I suppose. And usually my method of doing that is to stop interacting with them, because I've convinced myself that I'm the problem, since I've always been in the past.\n\nI'm not even scared of what my future holds, the only thing I'm interested in is deconfliction of the relationships I have with people.  The only reason I'm trying to do something for my future is because that's what would make my parents the least disappointed. \n\n\nI'm just... so empty. So goddamn empty.\n\n\nAnd my one friend told me a couple weeks ago that I'm a shell of who I used to be. And for once, it hurt."

I wasn't actually finished with this level, but I was already doing the Spanish Siele and English IELTs tests for putting in my extracurriculars at college, so I decided to do the JPLT too just to see how it was. \n\nTbh when I entered the room I was really surprised because I thought I'd be one of the oldest there, since Japanese is such a \"trendy\" language on the internet. I imagined a room full of teens, but I was probably the youngest there, lmao.\n\n The people were also pretty diverse, in the way that it wasn't just Japanese descendents, but also normal people you see anywhere. Literally every single person also looked (and probably is) a nerd, and for some reason 90% wore glasses (including me) ,lol. I thought the nerd stereotype was just a stereotype until that day XD. It also had a considerable amount of people, considering how hard the language is, but it's done in just this one center in the whole RJ state, so idk.\n\nBesides, the exam was fully of objective answers in paper, with reading and listening parts, unlike the exam of other languages that also had speaking and writing parts. I think that was hilarious because it perfectly fits the Japanese culture. It's like the exam reflects the country's/language's personality.\n\nThe exam also had questions that seemed more like N2 or N4. Some kanjis like \u8aad\u3080(read) or \u8a71\u3059(speak) that are literally N5 had hiraganas above them, when other ones that were harder didn't, and these two literally had questions asking to identify them, and at the same page they were asking to identify kanjis about medical terms like \n\u5931\u8840 (blod loss).\ud83d\udc80 \n\nWell, overall it was a good experience imo, but I was a little disappointed about the questions. I expected more from such an organised and educated country like Japan, and I feel bad for the friends I made there because unlike me doing just for fun, some people were doing to get scholarships at local colleges. I still love the language and on December of 2023, I plan on taking a higher level XD. \n\nThanks for anyone who read until the end, here's a cookie for you \ud83c\udf6a\ud83d\udc95"

Lots of socializing in clubs and such so we weren't socially stunted.\n- dangerous maskless face: it was way before the pandemic but as adults my sisters, mom and I were all good about wearing masks (and still do in certain places), my dad was never happy about wearing masks and only did when forced to \n- at least 6 siblings: nope, just three of us\n- stack of books: definitely. My older sister especially loves reading \n- natural hair color: I've had purple hair, and more recently pink. I plan on trying other colors too. My mom had bright orange/red hair for several decades. \n- listening to adventures in Odyssey: I don't recall ever listening to that \n- 15 passenger van: we had a mini van, but not a giant van\n- parody Christian shirt: we are Christians but none of us are into parody Christian shirts \n- musical instruments: yes. All about the instruments and choir.\n- has not changed genders: true\n\nOverall we were just normal kids that had more time to play than other kids. It was great having our individual learning styles catered to and we all got a 4.0 in high school, highest honors in college, and one of my sisters got her PhD. Homeschooling may not be good in every case (it's heavily dependent upon the skills and dedication of the parents) but it was great for us.",

A few weeks ago a toe on my right foot started getting red, swollen, and itchy, especially after a hot shower or when I'd lay down to go to sleep. It started feeling tender and got more red after a few days but I thought it was a bug bite or something. Then it started developing a dark red spot almost like an ulcer. A few days later it spread to another toe on the same foot with the same progression of symptoms. A week later and the toes on my left foot are starting to show the same symptoms (same toes on both feet). I've been soaking my feet in hot water with Epsom salt which helps with itching and tenderness, and applying antiseptic cream to the worst looking spots. One spot is starting to change colors so I'm going to urgent care tomorrow to make sure it's not infected or going gangrenous. \n\nThe closest thing I could find online is Raynaud's phenomenon, as it appears to be a circulation issue rather than from a sting, bite, or fungal infection. Has anyone else with dysautonomia had Raynaud's severely enough to cause ulcers or gangrene? I've read that severe cases tend to be from an underlying condition such as an autoimmune disease. I haven't been tested for autoimmune diseases and I'm honestly scared to go down that rabbit hole. Has anyone else experienced something similar?\n\nEdit: I went to urgent care and the doctor agreed that it's a circulation issue, possibly Raynaud's, and she recommended I see my doctor to start investigating autoimmune disorders. Thankfully the tissue wasn't dead yet so there's hope of it healing if I increase circulation. \n\nTLDR: weird toe problems, probably Raynaud's, scared it's an autoimmune disease"

This can make holidays a stressful and difficult time for those of us with chronic illnesses that affect the digestive system. Some of us have very restrictive diets, have to eat at certain times, or are only able to snack instead of have regular sized meals. Having your normal routines disrupted or questioned by family can make you feel even more isolated in your illness, and it may illicit unwanted advice or questioning from those able to eat normally. \n\nPersonally, I have POTS which messes with my appetite and digestion. Typically I eat small snacks throughout the day and always eat in a recliner with my feet up to help reduce tachycardia. Thankfully I don't have any food intolerances but I avoid fatty foods and excessive sugar because they can make me feel worse, so not many holiday treats for me. I also have food anxiety because I was very ill with gallbladder problems for nearly a year which caused severe nausea when I tried to eat. Sitting with others at a table and thinking about eating makes my anxiety worse so it's best if I watch something to distract myself while eating. My parents are very understanding but I think it's strange to others that I eat in the living room in a recliner by myself watching TV rather than joining them at the table.\n\nI know I'm not alone and many of you are feeling extra down about everything your illness makes you miss out on. I just want to let you know that I'm thinking of all of you this holiday season and hope there is something you can enjoy about the holidays besides food. Also, please do what is necessary for you to manage your symptoms, whether it is \"normal\" eating behavior or not."

                "body": "I'm currently renting a house with two other girls and really struggling with their lack of cleanliness. My grandma owns the house (she's in a care facility now) and my father manages it. It's a very nice home and we get a killer deal on rent. My roommates are nice people and there hasn't really been drama, but they are both very dirty and I'm sick of dealing with their filth. Thankfully I have the master bedroom with my own bathroom (I pay a bit more rent) so I have a place to escape to. The main problem is the kitchen. Here are some of the recurring problems: \n\n- they cook and then leave dishes/food mess all over the counters so I have to move dishes then wipe the counters before I can do anything \n- they leave dirty dishes full of rotting water in the sink for weeks, sometimes over a month, at a time (I have to move dishes out of one side so I can wash my dishes) \n- they don't throw away spoiled food so the fridge is packed full (thankfully I have my own shelf) and smells bad; we even have another fridge in the garage along with a chest freezer (which one roommate has completely filled by herself)\n- sometimes one roommate (the food hoarder) will set containers of spoiled food out on the counter like she was about to empty them into the trash, but then they remain there for a month \n- they treat the garage like a dump and I've had to clean up spoiled food that they just left out there; bin of moldy apples, bag of rotting hamburger patties, container of spoiled food that leaked all over a piece of furniture I was going to sell \n- one roommate puts dirty dishes in the garage if there are too many to fit in the sink; my favorite pan went missing for a month and it turns out she just put it in the garage and then it showed up on the counter one day with a bunch of other dirty dishes \n- one roommate has a dog and doesn't pick up poop regularly so the back yard is unusable \n- there are water rings and other stains/damage on most of the furniture\n- both leave random crap in the common areas; there has been a kid play kitchen thing in the entryway for months now because one roommate occasionally has her niece and nephew over but she hasn't put it in a closet or the garage for some reason so I'm stuck looking at it\n- some of my grandmas stuff is still in the house (some furniture, wall decor) and I made it clear that it doesn't have to stay there but they need to let me know before they replace it so I can properly store it or give it to my family; one roommate has almost completely redecorated with all of her stuff and just puts my grandma's stuff on the floor or in the garage (without telling me) where it can get broken\n\nWe had a meeting earlier this summer and set up a chore schedule which has helped a bit. I was very honest about my expectations of cleanliness and they happily agreed. Things were much better for a few weeks but then they reverted back. I have a chronic illness that leaves me very little energy for cooking/dishes and sometimes I don't eat as well as I should because it's too much effort to have to clear a space to cook, clean the counter, wash the pots/pans I need, THEN cook. Eating is a struggle for me right now because of my illness and being in the kitchen gives me anxiety and makes me feel sick from the smell. Even with my health issues I wash my dishes within 24 hours of using them, and always put my dishes by the sink out of the way if I'm unable to wash them immediately. \n\nWould it be reasonable to not renew their leases and try to find cleaner roommates? Or is it wrong to deny lease renewal based solely on cleanliness? I won't ask them to leave before their lease is up. If I do make them leave, how do I go about finding roommates who are ACTUALLY clean? Both said they are clean (one even complained about how her previous roommates never cleaned their dishes lol) but obviously that was a lie.\n\nEdit: We now have a mouse problem because of my messy roommates. They refuse to store food properly and clean up after themselves and yet they wonder why the mice aren't going in any traps; probably because the mice have plenty of food and thus have no reason to go in traps. I'm the only one storing food in containers, cleaning up my dishes right away, and disposing of food waste properly. They're blaming the problem on the fact that our garage is cluttered, but my grandma is a hoarder and lived here for years with the garage packed full of stuff and never had mice; she hoarded stuff but was clean and stored food properly. I've been finding mouse poop in my stuff (even my clean clothes folded nicely in my closet) and it's the last straw."

Thing is while she likes the vegetables, legumes, meats and dairies, she listed out for me, she doesn't like certain combinations of some of them. So I wanted to make alfredo chicken pasta yesterday because she likes heavy cream and chicken but she told me she didn't like this combination. I expected of her to name the possibilities each item I bought on the grocery store holds, relying on the fact that she's a Ne user and I'm not but her mind couldn't go beyond what I presented her with. \"You cook and I will try it to see if it's good, that's it. After some time you'll determine what I like.\" \n\nThere's also the fact that her brain can't function unless her physical body is occupied. She reminded me a lot of this episode from my little pony https://youtu.be/jzH1FVpn2Ts\nThere's this pony that has to find a memorisation technique that works for her in order to pass some exams but everything her friends suggested (flash cards, annotating, pop quizzes) didn't help her. Being aware of her surroundings 24/7 though, she unconsciously takes note of everything that's going on around her, especially when she's flying, aka during a time where her physical body is occupied. \nI can't get into deep thinking when someone is talking, I can't process what I'm reading, it ruins my concentration, my sister however, will literally ask me to ramble about nonsense because to her, the silence has the same effect sounds have for me. \nShe can successfully multitask, which is something I definitely can't do, has an inclination on physical interests that she practices regularly, just like you mentioned, but when it comes to creativity is limited to what meets the eye. Her extraverted approach on the world isn't about producing with her mind and thought, like ideas and opportunities, it's about producing with her body. She doesn't acknowledge the impact potentiality has, is very grounded and believes that she can only make a difference through the concrete. Unlike her, being mainly intuitive (I have a whole bunch of Se but she outSes me low diff) when caught up elsewhere, I usually consider likely outcomes, or \"this is how it should've went\"s of the past. I don't have maladaptive daydreaming but I relate to uncontrollable daydreaming that takes up hours of my day, which I found to fit the description of sexual 7 Enneagram. Maybe you should check out core 7 if you haven't already. Lastly back to my sister, to my surprise she isn't at all impulsive like the stereotypes suggest and is very scared to make mistakes (but she does have a very sharp tongue). \n\nI put two and two together and I can't believe I didn't see it earlier it's so obvious. My Ni doesn't do me any justice if I'm obtuse as I am does it?",

Maybe making it so that you can ride them with a different type of saddle that were craftable, that woud be nice for those who want to ride a horse like mob without having a saddle early game since those can be a bit hard to come by.\n\nBecause right now there isn't a single reason to use them outside of \"novelty\" with heavy air quotes unless you're in a big dessert and you need to use it to find another biome to replace them with a horse.\n\nIt's cool to have ambiance mobs, but the camel has a lot of potential to be a good useful mob, it would be a shame if it stayed as it is.\n\nMaybe make that saddle craftable with leather or rabbit hide to finally give it a use (and can also be obtained in the dessert), that plus tiny advantages that it has like the height difference, the dash and double ridding would be enough to differentiate them, and there would be a use to them out aside form personal preference.\n\nI think making a game fun should be prioritized over making the too realistic.\n\nAnd if they want to go the realistic route there are fun things that can lead to as well. For example, camels can drink 114 lts/ 30 gallons of water in one sitting (I didn't google that trust me x'D) maybe make it so that you could store water source blocks or maybe they can be right clicked with a bucket to get water since the dessert is known for not having much, just silly ideas would make it more fun and maybe worth while for technical players or speedrunners.\n\nI would love to read other suggestions to make camels different/better in the comments.\n\nThx for reading."

                "body": "\\*Anyone\n\nI've been struggling to enjoy the kinds of entertainment I have in the past recently. I'm 33 and used to absolutely love games, stories, fiction in general. I still participate in these activities, although I did take a bit of a break from everything but TV and Movies and, like, mobile games for about a year while I was dealing with some upswelling depression and anhedonia during late pandemic times. I thought maybe I was done being a 'gamer' but I'm more-or-less back in full swing now and wouldn't categorize myself as depressed any more.\n\nI saw an old post of mine, 2010, where I was just so excited to be playing a new game on a FB memory. It really brought me back and I realized I just don't have that spark of excitement any more.\n\nMy question is this: Is this just growing up, like Blink-182 said? I'm not so sure, since I see plenty of 30s and 40s+ that are into Marvel or Destiny or Call of Duty still, full-throttle still. Is it, perhaps, a maturing thing which is not tied to age? Like, I just can't summon any \"Awesome!\" energy when I see mindless action or gameplay any more. Even art of superhero-like figures just makes me feel absolutely nothing, even if they look like the 'cool' stuff I used to be obsessed with. (Ya know, cool masks and costumes, magic powers, cool swords and armor) I kinda just feel like they all blend together into a nothing, grey milkshake now.\n\nI feel like I'm probably cynical in many ways, but I was always cynical (maybe even moreso in the  past) but now I just can't be bothered to even consider the latest action movie, AAA game, or really anything that feels even a *little* 'mindless' or perhaps 'common'. And I don't mean in a /r/iamverysmart way. At least not on purpose. It actually makes me sad, not prideful.\n\nOne reason I ask is the theory that maybe living through the pandemic as an older teen or adult really made us confront reality in a way that community trauma tends to? I have no idea if others feel this way, but the doomer memes indicate, to me, that people are less entertained by the bread and circuses that worked before, perhaps. Dr K himself has a video about how much society has changed and apocalyptic threats are directly affecting our culture.\n\nI dunno, it's not a super urgent thing but I wonder if, in this demographic, there might be others that relate or could shed more light on this feeling. There are still things I like, but they're much more few than before, and I feel so picky or discerning that I'm angry at myself for not being able to 'just like' things like I used to. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't combating the rising feeling of judging those who still like these types of things. (Ya'll know the marvel and disney child-adults who just seem annoyingly positive about what seems to others like utter crap, but I try my best to never act on it or even put that judgement into the universe with a confidant, but my wife and I get into our rants occasionally)\n\nBasically, is it normal to be losing my childlike wonder this late? After I cleared 25, 28 or so I thought I was done baking and was going to be pretty similar for the rest of my life. But this only started in the last \\~3 years or so. Everything in the universe just seems so much more **serious** now. If you're not teaching a profitable life-skill, teaching me about how to interact with my friends and peers, not explaining a scholarly topic, or a high-quality game with a sophisticated story or top-tier gameplay, it just seems like a waste of time now. (Also: Is this possibly a 'tough economy' effect?) I also find myself playing the same games (including remakes)  from 2010 - 2018 over and over, only rarely adding a new one and often dropping it quickly.\n\nI just want to hear how other people above, say, 20yo, are finding the media these days, lol. Besides TikTok.  The last thing I want to do is be an 'old man yells at cloud' as I age but I feel the seeds growing."

                "body": " You awaken in your lair. You sigh, and try to force your lids closed once more. It's no use. Your mind is awake, yet again.\n\nYou  push on the lid of your coffin and it swings open, revealing a less  comforting shade of dark. You rub your face,  dry and limp skin moving  beneath your fingers like clay. Yet another night of devilish unlife.\n\nYou  arise and exit out of your comfortable box, having engaged in blissful  rest, passing the day, now viscerally feeling the need to rise and feed.  You curse your lot, but you must continue the curse. A vague, ancient  memory of stepping into cascading water washes over your gelatinous  insides. You have no idea if it is your own forgotten habit rearing it's  head, some half-remembered dream reality, or simply a manifestation of  the cruel world of the swine that you unfortunately inhabit this planet  with, a collective thought, invading your mental fortress. But you  resist it! That mundane life is not for you. Oh, no. Not tonight.\n\nYou  grab your thick rimmed, plastic glasses from the nightstand. Regardless  of your terrifying visage, you still need sight correction to stalk  your prey. No matter your efforts to blend in, they still run. Why do  the fleshbags quail in your presence and flee your gaze? What is it they  can discern from your presence, no matter your efforts to conceal?\n\nOh right, you are a monster.\n\nYou  make your way into another familiar haunt. There's the icebox here. You  open it mechanically, vacant eyes dreary to another period of dreaded  wakefulness. Yet another night-dawn. Yet another obligation to feed.\n\nYou  bend over, and release a dry grunt. The rigors of rest flaking off of  you. Gratefully, no one would witness your shameful display here. No one  to hear your weakness as you re-gather your strength. You push aside a  few items, barely even registering their existence. Perhaps some kind of  leftover, perhaps a moldy pack of cheese. You have no idea and you have  no interest, besides. Who even put that putrescent tat here? Was it you  of the past? Some intruder during the daytime? Who cares? Not you, and  that is the truth.\n\nYou grab a carton and fumble absentmindedly with the top. The spoil inside has revealed itself. You drink deep.\n\nAgainst  your own will, your body ejaculates a gulp for air after you finish.  Pathetic fleshing behavior, a remnant of your upbringing clinging  pointlessly to your dark life. What a waste of energy. Truly, nothing is  worse than reminds of the old times. Or, anything that reminds you of  the mortal infestation, really. Breath. Urgh. Who needs it? The  disgusting bastards out there, that's who.\n\nRegardless,  you feel a modicum of energy radiate from esophageal tract to stomach  to chest, and then outward into your limbs. Not to the tips of your  fingers and toes and head, of course. Oh no, that would be for the  people that are alive. No. You, instead, are animated by an evil  necrotic power now, after the transformation. You blink off the  unfortunate tatters of life clinging, and shake your diabolical head  ever so slightly. Your thoughts turn to the precious night.\n\nSeveral  moments of blank thought later, you find yourself in front of a glass  pane near the entrance to your lair. You peek around the window covers,  never disturbing them so as to not be noticed by the sick and twisted  outside world. There, the creatures out there. Teeming. This seems out  of place, considering the mortal time. They are not ones to be attracted  to the dark, unlike your kind.\n\n\"Shit!\"  you exclaim to the wonderful, dark embrace of your empty room. How  could you forget? Or rather, how could you ever have allowed yourself to  assume you would remember? It is mortals who track the changing of the  seasons to closely, your kind is meant to be above such trifling  matters! But alas, until they can be exterminated in full, you must,  else you suffer consequences such as this. What a wrenched idiot you  are, as always. You dart back from the window, distress arising within  you at the thought of your sanctum under siege.\n\n*What do I do, what do I do... Satan smite them!* you think as you pace back and forth erratically.\n\nSeemingly,  the creatures had kept their distance so far, but it was only a matter  of time. Your wards were working, but you could feel their weakness. On  days such as today, the teeming masses gained power as the night drags  on. Given time, they would easily be bypassed.\n\nThese  insidious freaks always find you eventually, no matter how far you flee  or where hide. Crawling, tearing, ripping at your soul and your flesh,  attempting to consume you, to slay you and grind you into nothingness!  Yet still, they call *you* the  monster, blind to their own mortal fetishes. Today, more than almost any  other, is the worst for their sick, invasive tendencies.\n\nAll  it takes is one accursed gobliney manling to muster some spat of  courage in his wretched heart, egged on by his insipid little followers,  and they'll be lead to your doorstep in an instant. Perhaps you could  fling the door open, revealing your mad demeanor, and they'd run? No,  no, no! Such a tactic would only serve to make your problems worse. The  armed goons in uniform that the humans rely upon, , will inevitably show  up if you were so bold. The swine don't know how to live without their  ranchers, their protectors are their selfsame murderers come harvest.\n\nDoubtless,  the little brat would cry to his protective womb-tether. How pitiful,  that the little cretins are incapable of heeding the consequences of  their very own actions. No creature of the night would be caught alive  relying on another so. What weakness.\n\nMurder. It's the *only*  option then. It must be done quietly, however. The next man spawnling  that dares to enter the sanctity of your property is doomed. That's  right, they will serve as the vessel for your righteous seethe. It's  been quite some time since you've fed on the living energy anyway. It'll  give you a thrill. Maybe. But *how?*\n\nSpinning  on your heel, you find your unlife returning to even your extremities,  now. This time, with this dark impulse, the action is rejuvenating.  Finally, a good night to be a dark one, after all this time. Yes,  finally. Sweet revenge. Your mostly naked pale body shuffles with unholy  ambition across the room, into the kitchen and out the other side, down  the hall and... *\"EEP!\"* you startle and exclaim internally as your doorbell rings.\n\n*Shit, shit, shit. Not yet. Not now!*\n\nYou scramble left, then right. What do you do? You are unprepared. You knew this was coming but *this* soon?! Your fingers fly with nervous energy, twiddling uselessly as your mind reels from the unexpected stimulus.\n\nFinally,  gathering a basic plan of action, you continue your journey back into  the deep recesses of your lair, and grab the first piece of cloth that  presents itself to you. Some long, black thing draped on your dresser.  Did you wear this yesterday? Who knows, anymore. What even *is* yesterday. What is today. What is the difference to anyone, and why should anyone care. How *could* anyone care? Whatever. There's an invasion to address.\n\nYou  throw on the garment. Yes, this will do fine. It covers your wretched  flesh adequately, and will serve it's purpose. The humans may even think  it 'festive'. You cringe at this thought, and turn to the exit. Your  newly donned cape swishes through the air you left vacant. Now, for the  next problem. The real problem. The, uurgh, *mortal* problem.\n\nThese little thankless gremlins will be *expecting*  things of you. Disgusting, wretched, twisted and evil! Perhaps your  granary stores have something sate their all-consuming hunger. How dare  they invade *your* space and demand gifts as their reward! Entitled scum, every one of them. The big ones, the little ones, all of them.\n\nThe  in-betweens were the worst of them all. If you refuse to participate in  their time wasting and invasion rituals, it was the in-betweens that  break through the psychic wards you placed upon your sanctuary with  intent to ruin your peace, perhaps even your property. Damn them all to  hell, where Lord Satan will enact the rightful punishment for such slime  blighting, as they do, this wasteful, hateful world. You exit the  kitchen with a bowl of whatever tat and remainders you managed to gather  from the pantry under duress.\n\nYou  creep, silently, slowly, towards the door. This sacred monolith, the  last bastion of defense that stands between you and the unholy  earth-infestation and their sickening smallminded society with it's  extreme pressure to conform underlying all of it's grotesque activity.  You muffle your footsteps with the heel-toe stealth technique of your  kind. Silently gliding, billowing clothes breaking your silhouette and  hood masking your hideous, disfigured visage, you approach the door.\n\nYou  place one evil eye up to the spyglass and confirm your worst fears. You  sigh, once again. There was no getting out of this one. You must steel  yourself for an encounter. Having forgot the date, you left the  thrice-cursed porch light on, once again!\n\nLast  year's oaths were in vain, it seems. You silently pledge your devotion  to darkness this time next year. You shan't forget again. You mustn't!  Every contact with these damnable sheeple threatens to tear your  precious, occult reality away from you if a single wrong move is made.\n\nOne  hand clutches the large, plastic orange bowl while you fumble with the  locks using your other rotten appendage. There was no more benefit to  subterfuge, the freaks were just milling about on your porch, gazing  expectantly from the door to your abode and then to each other.\n\nYou  unlatch the chain. You flip the metal brace. You lift up and slide the  latch. The deadbolt is loosed. You ready the knob. You pause, just for a  moment, the make sure the little monsters hadn't left yet. Someone  where in the recesses of your dark mind, hope still springs. Perhaps the  rumors that were undoubtedly spread in the neighborhood about you had  dawned on them, just now, after detecting the subtle and sweet scent of  fear on one of their peers, and they had lost their misplaced courage  and broke ranks.\n\nNo. No, of course not. They were still there. More expectant than ever. Curses!  Hope be damned!\n\nYou  turn the doorknob, every fiber of your unholy being raging against the  progress towards the inevitable conflict. Something deep inside that you  would rather deny, something worse than even yourself pulls you forward  ever still and you are compelled to open the door.\n\n\"Trick  or Treat!\" screamed the shrill voices of the disorganized gaggle of  kneehigh man-spawn gathered on your private property. This behavior  betrays that they have no idea of the danger they were in. A snap of the  wrist, a single spasm of your muscle, imbued with the power of evil, is  all it would take to end them and this entire charade of an existence.\n\nWith  that thought you take a small measure of pleasure, which enables a  grimace to spread across your face. They had not, apparently, noticed  that your body is not simply one of make-up and illusion. This body they  perceive and must feel arcane terror emanating from, tugging at the pit  of their soul, is simply your every day. Or, night. Your true self,  regardless. The unbridled horror of your existence, on full display. Any  other day, they would scream and run. But the intoxicating effect of  age-old artifice and traditional pagan holyday observance deceives these  fragile animals and their breeding keepers to feel safe, even as they  approach the butcher.\n\nPasting the  insidious grimace on your face that you use for their kind, you speak  your truth. \"My, look at all the little monsters we have here!\" you say.  You imagine the sight  the little goblins must be drinking in, with  your fanged teeth flashing in the moonlight and corrupt garments issuing  a rightful air of import.\n\nTheir  broodmother lurks just behind your overgrown brush defense line,  doubtless judging and ready to pounce with her disgusting protective  breeding instincts fueling her at a moment's notice. She makes eye  contact with you. She bears her teeth in the primate ritual these  mortals pretend to be blind to the meaning of, only partially hiding her  animalistic nature. Maybe we weren't so different after all.\n\nBut  no matter. You must maintain the act! Else, the emboldened grand  wizards of these creatures, drunk on heroic narratives, will show up and  this relatively tolerable human interaction will be the least of your  worries. You nod to her, and bend down to allow the tiny humans to  access your treasures.\n\nYour back  cracks. Your shoulders ache. The distended muscles in your face threaten  to fail any moment now. The little wretches approach and swarm your  position. You extend your torturous incline, as you sit above them on  the unhallowed foundation of your beloved lair. This pain, on their  behalf, will be noted, humans.\n\nThe  grubby hands of these scamps shoot out from under multicolored fabrics  like the onslaught of bats exiting a cave-mouth at sunset. They create  strange noises as well, not unlike those same bats. Tittering, giggles,  and instantaneous squabbling as each of them activate their primeval  instincts in response to what they value being presented to them, their  base desires to have the best pick of the spoils flowing through their  tiny frames, uninhibited by social conditioning. The veil of society  falls off tonight. Disgusting gremlins.\n\nFor  a brief moment, you find your grimace a little less forced as their  darkest impulses present themselves and you see the faintest glimmer of  yourself and your fellow dark companions. Horrible, these things are  most certainly, yet extremely valuable for their insight into the  Devilish core of every one of those surface dwellers that they try  oh-so-hard to deny.\n\n\"What *is*  this?\" mumbles the tiny lips of one of these diminutive creatures. The  garish garb and panted face indicates this manling is portraying a  supposed joy-bringer the humans seem to enjoy and fear in equal measure.  He denies the validity of your offering? You squint, to see what his  shrunken hand with a stubby finger is jamming itself at.\n\n\"Candy,\" you reply.\n\nIs  this not what they desire from you? An offering of sweets to offset the  odorous presence of such a creature in their neighborhood, once a year?  The ritual is complete, is it not? In their primitive transactional  brains, this was a way to rectify the vacuous life of one such as myself  that sucks the lifeblood out of their simple suburban toil. These  monkeys always demand to be paid for any minor inconvenience or slight  deviation from their expectations. The entitled bastards, one and all.\n\nThe  small man-spawn demonstrates admirable audacity as it's face scrunches  and seems to accept this less-than-ideal fate. Good, good. Life will  disappoint you, little one, and it's best you learn that now. Perhaps  you will think twice the next time you decide to mindlessly follow your  broodmother out into the night, tagging behind them as the tribe invades  another's serenity. Almost certainly not, however.\n\nAs  if practiced at some kind of cult meeting, all of them turn their back  on you in unison. The transaction is complete in true, and you allow  your unnatural mask to fall back to it's resting state. Finally.\n\nYour  excitement grows as you are met with the reality of an obligation  fulfilled. Peace will be returning to your kingdom tantalizingly soon.  The creator of these tiny creatures seems to have some kind of desire to  ensure you return to your prison, and attempts to make eye contact as  you dart back behind the safety of your wooden shield. The temptation to  slam the portal closed threatens to overtake you, but you manage to  summon the requisite composure required around these judgemental flesh  bags and maintain control.\n\nYou  release all of your tension and set the orange bowl on the wooden  construct next to the door. Why was that little twerp so rude?\n\n\"Candy,\" you repeat to yourself. \"What in the seven layers of hell did he expect from me, anyway?\"\n\nYou  gaze into the bowl. A few individually wrapped packages stare back at  you, no two the same. Something red, something blue, something white.  The remnants of your life, among the last of your earthly possessions,  given freely, but under duress, to the invading horde. What a horrible  day. What kind of weak, shackled subservience was this, for a monster  such as yourself? Besides, some of these were your favorite. If they  don't want them, so be it.\n\nYou  reach your twisted hand with it's engorged knuckles into the bowl and  find one such target. A squishy little morsel, imported from far-away  lands in a fruitless attempt to sate your twisted desire to escape the  torture of daily existence in this horrible little village. You know  that, of course, every place on this murky globe of ours is horrid, but  there were at least a *few*  cultures that knew how to create acceptable confectioneries. You pop the  gummy into your mouth and the familiar flavor of kiwi floods your  malformed nostril caves within your gaping maw. That child would never  know what they were missing! You flip off your porch light, regardless.  More for you.\n\n\\---\n\nThe invasive transmission ends there, but you feel that it's only a matter of time before the cursed signal catches you again. o/"

Many reviewers are not aware that this figure includes conditions which most clinicians do not recognize as intersex, such as Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, and late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. If the term intersex is to retain any meaning, the term should be restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female. Applying this more precise definition, the true prevalence of intersex is seen to be about **0.018%** ([Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12476264/)).\n\nSo, yes, 2 sexes.\n\n\n\n>gender can\u2019t be binary, because it is a personal identity and is socially constructed.\n\nA person's gender is not their 'identity' because it's their sex. I don't 'identify' as a man because I simply AM a man. The fact that you called gender identity a 'social construct' means you admit that it does not exist in objective reality. Therefore, sex and gender are one and the same. This is why they share the same words (male/female) instead of using different words. It's why the dictionary defines 'woman' as an adult human 'female'.\n\n\n\n>Put simply, transgender kids\u2019 brains resemble their gender identity and not their biological sex.\n\nBut we don't scan people's brain activity to determine their 'gender' any more than we test the age of each individual cell of a person to determine their age or do genetic tests to determine their race. Gender, age and race are all determined by point of reference and the point of reference for **GEN**der is a person's **GEN**italia.\n\nIf scanning brain activity shows that a child with male genitalia will likely behave in a more 'feminine' manner than masculine, that doesn't change the fact their gender is male. It just means they'll be an effeminate male, which is perfectly normal.\n\nI asked for 'proof' but you only provided a skewed statistic and a false narrative.",

Like it was a slight trade off of abilities and disabilities. Now I\u2019m starting to notice I keep constantly asking questions I\u2019ve asked before because I\u2019m not quite sure enough if I remember the answer correctly, I keep almost making stupid and painful (not physically) mistakes by forgetting small but important details when setting up and doing stuff like offsets, I jump mentally through all the things I need to do and sometimes get ahead of myself or sometimes get behind. I take longer than everyone else in the class to get going, and in general feel like I am probably going to be inherently worse at this line of work than your average joe. \n\nNow, I know feelings don\u2019t necessarily correlate with fact, but I can\u2019t shake this feeling. I\u2019m towards the end of this program too. I just want to do a good job and not be a lesser machinist because of forgetfulness or whatever else comes with ADHD. Anyone have any advice?"

It is split into three panels the third of which, the depiction of hell, contains  The Tree Man, a self-portrait of bosch with trees for legs, a broken eggshell for a body, and a bar up his backside. The body and bar being a part of the portrait which is located in hell symbolically say to the viewer that Bosch is going to hell because he has lost his spirituality and replaced it with the temptation of sin. \n\nWhile the presence of this is a message says a couple of things one of them is that Bosch thinks he lacks spirituality and so belongs in hell which is painfully ironic considering he was so religious he made Michelangelo look like an atheist. when he made this painting he was one of the highest-ranking members of an extremely conservative HARDCORE orthodox catholic brotherhood called \"The Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady\".\n\nThis extreme irony makes it seem like bosch is being humble by showing himself going to hell but he's such a devout catholic that to me it comes across as dickish. It's kind of like bosch if bosch absolutely destroyed you in chess but then he says he played really poorly. like screw you dude I can't even compete! if you're calling yourself trash then what does that make me?\n\n...\n\nso that's why I need a word for that. ... it's been a long night."

When I imagined doing stuff like kissing with them, mostly I couldn't envision it at all but with a select few I'd be fine / willingly reciprocate if they initiated it. All I knew definitely was that I wanted to matter to them in a way that was more close/different than their other friends, which likely why I believed they were crushes since that felt like a very \"relationship-like\" desire."

I get why he confessed and it made the finale a lot stronger, but I don't think I would've been able to do it. I think the most I would've been able to do would be to put as much of the Howard Hamlin case on myself as possible to get Cheryl to go easy on Kim. That and maybe tried to get in contact with Kim some way to talk over things; tell her how sorry I was and about Chuck. Ask if she wanted to set up a meeting and offer to help with the civil suit as much as I could. Maybe she wouldn't want me to do anything, but I'd still offer."

We ask them what they want to be when they grow up, and when they say something like astronaut or rockstar we smile and tell them that's a great idea. But we never talk about how rare those jobs are and how difficult they are for a regular person to get, yet if that's still their dream when they're older we laugh at them for being unrealistic.\n\n-Red, the guy who was least interested in having a career, got promoted to upper management solely because the talking fax machine liked him. He also grows noticably more cocky and entitled as the episode goes on. Everyone treated him like a superior, so he started to believe he *was* superior.\n\nThis definitely happens in the real world; at my last job people who were friends with the bosses, and in one case, sleeping with the boss, got promoted over people who had been there for years. And they defintely let that power go to their head.\n\n-Duck guy represents the cocky \"gifted\" child who was always told he was smarter and would grow to be more successful than his peers, only to fall behind all the \"regular\" kids when he got out into the actual workforce\n\n-Yellow guy represents both how you can make the best out of a crappy job if you bond with your coworkers and are kind to them, but also the dangers of giving your entire life to a job. At the end of the episode, he's celebrating being at the factory for 40 years, only to get tossed aside in an instant for getting his arm ripped off.  \n\n-Unemployed Brendan is a parody of how we treat unemployed people as dumb, lazy, and pathetic, but I feel like that's pretty obvious.\n\nAt first, I wasn't a huge fan of the Jobs episode, maybe because a lot of it hits kind of close to home. But it's slowly becoming one of my favorites for how insightful it is"

I'm not a chemist or a skincare specialist so it might very well be fine (and I hope it is) but it doesn't seem like alcohol and sunscreen would go together very well.

While getting over that and dealing with the new insecurities I got from that is one thing, the other is putting myself back out there. \n\nI promised myself until September to just not think about anyone romantically. Just to get some space and learn to be single again. Do things for me. Do the things I didn't for whatever reason during my previous relationship.\n\nThe irony is that a seemingly \"perfect\" guy (20M) appeared into my life. We are very similar and met up once. We live across the country but I'll be moving to a city closer to him soon. He seems very interested in getting to know me.\n\nMy dilemma is that I do not want to concern myself with the efforts a relationship would demand right now. Even after moving it would still be middle-distance. My previous was very long distance and I fear being in a similar situation of the relationship being mainly online, making future plans to fit some idealistic future together etc. \n\nNot to mention starting fresh in a new city, most of my energy would go toward college life. And additionally, texting him has been bringing up a lot of wounds from my previous relationship - I'm obviously not healed enough yet. Him asking to call, meet up, watch a movie online - all things I deeply still associate with the ex.\n\nSorry if this is more a rant of why can't men just be friends with women. I crave  that feeling of sharing my day with someone, but would never dream of rebounding just for that.\n\nDo I just let him down? Is it really that simple? Even though in a future point I might be willing to try dating him. Or should I just take a leap of faith, for better or worse it would just be another experience.\n\nTLDR; I'm not over my previous relationship yet after almost 3 months. Having trouble giving a new guy a chance due to the similar positive qualities in them both and wanting to focus on myself as I heal and start uni in a new city soon. \nDo I stay true to singlehood or get over my insecurities at a snap?"

Consensual pictures only, please.\n\n-Posts must be about, relating to, or at least inclusive of the girlfriend\n\n-Only accounts that are older than 90 days may be approved\n\n-Accounts MUST have consistent post history of content they would want in this subreddit\n\n-Spammy posts, too much OF promotion, history of rude or mean posts/comments will automatically get you ignored\n\n-Please note that accounts who do not post here for 45 days will be removed with no notice\n\nIf your account meets the criteria listed above then you may feel free to personally DM me so that I may review your account or send a message to the moderators of this sub to ask.\n\nWhy is this happening?\nSpam. It\u2019s extremely tiring and sometimes painstaking to go in and remove dozens of spammy posts every 2 hours, it\u2019s also a great way to have an exclusive club of people who can share themselves and not be flooded out by thousands of other accounts doing the same thing."

Each post must be featuring the girlfriend or be about the girlfriend in some way. Wives, mistresses, fwb are also allowed.\n\nSend me a DM requesting access to post here. I will be looking for consistency in your posts (hence the account age), spam, fake or harassing posts and other things that may be red flags in an accounts history.\n\nAs of this post we have 9 approve submitters who will each be notified of their status.\n\nThanks and stay freaky!"
