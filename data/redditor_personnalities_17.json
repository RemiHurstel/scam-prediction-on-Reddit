What are they thinking about if not the things they love and adore? Is it really not normal to just constantly dwell on your favorite book, game, TV show, movie, or other interests and genuinely not being able to stop?\n\nI've seen questions of *how* neurotypicals think, but I want to know: *What* do they think *about?* Isn't it ridiculously hard for them to stop thinking about the things they enjoy so they can focus on important things like it is for neurodivergent people?\n\n**Edit: I would like to clarify I know not all people of either side are like how I describe.

This is an extremely loose translation I created for the official [Cookie Run Kingdom Love Test](https://www.banggooso.com/gl/63/) I made based on my (extremely limited) knowledge of Korean and based on machine translation in Google Translate. Everything is reworded to be more easily understood by English speakers, so please don't expect an almost word-for-word translation. If anyone here knows Korean and could provide more accurate translations to any aspect I wrote, please do so and I'll edit this post and credit you for the translation! **I don't want to seem like I'm trying to look like an expert in Korean, I'm just trying to provide a tool for English-speaking Cookie Run fans who struggled with this quiz like I did.**\n\nOne other note: **This is a quiz to see what cookie YOU would act most like in a relationship, not a quiz to see who would be compatible with you!** That's not to say it doesn't show who would be compatible with you at all, though. Under your result, you will see two cookies. The one on the left will be the cookie you would be most compatible with romantically, and the one on the right will be the one you would be least compatible with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[For example, my result was Kumiho Cookie, and it shows Espresso Cookie as the most compatible, and Vampire Cookie as the least compatible for me.](https://preview.redd.it/bs4misnlgvk81.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fc7df38f93ae346fbf23dfdef92bb0786eddcfd5)\n\nAnd a final note: The questions and answers on the quiz do not shuffle! This means the answers are always in order, so you don't have to worry about what I wrote down as \"answer 1\" being shown as the second answer instead for you. You also don't have to worry about question 1 being moved to question 4, for another example.\n\nWith that, here's the questions and answers translated.\n\n**Q1: You found your ideal partner at a meeting! How do you act?**\n\nA1: I smile at them a lot and try to get all their contact info.\n\nA2: I can't bring myself to even look at them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q2: How long does it take you to develop feelings for someone?**\n\nA1: I have to think about it for a while before deciding.\n\nA2: In one charm. I can get a crush in an instant!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q3: It's the day before your first date. How much do you think of your partner?**\n\nA1: I don't feel much different. My partner is on my mind sometimes, but my day goes on as usual.\n\nA2: I'm waiting anxiously. All day I can't stop thinking about my partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q4: Finally, the first date! What do you do when an awkward silence appears during conversation?**\n\nA1: I try to start a new topic!\n\nA2: I'll wait for my partner to start a new topic!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q5: After three dates, your partner wants to establish a relationship. Do you want to?**\n\nA1: Only after three dates? I still need to get to know them more.\n\nA2: Yes! I'm so happy! I wanna go on another date soon!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q6: What kind of romance do you want?**\n\nA1: A passionate, deep romance, like in a romance film!\n\nA2: A fun, lighthearted romance!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q7: How do you like your partner to dress?**\n\nA1: Dressed up and tidy with well-groomed hair.\n\nA2: Casual and comfortable, they don't have to dress neatly so much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q8: When getting in a fight with your partner, you...**\n\nA1: Talk about facts of the matter first.\n\nA2: Talk about your feelings first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q9: You find a photo of your partner posing with someone else as if they were a couple...**\n\nA1: I'm sure it's a thing of the past, so it's okay.\n\nA2: I ask when and where the photo was taken.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q10: What are the main causes of quarrels between you and your partner?**\n\nA1: I try so hard to avoid conflict, I bottle up my feelings and they eventually explode.\n\nA2: I sometimes struggle to give all the love and attention they want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q11: What would you do if you and your partner broke up?**\n\nA1: I would try to forget about them. I would delete all my photos and contacts with them.\n\nA2: I would be overwhelmed with sadness, worrying about if they will still want to talk to me or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q12: What would you do to cope after a breakup?**\n\nA1: Talk to my friends about it for support.\n\nA2: Get my mind off of it by concentrating on my hobbies."

But I genuinely see learning and knowledge not as a means, but also as its own end. \n\nGoing to a good university (which doesn't necessarily means top20), that has good resources means having the opportunity to learn, expand your perspective of the world and meet people whom you can teach and learn from. There's just so many amazing things in the world; languages, astronomy, history... Sometimes I watch those space videos, or a book review, and it makes me want to learn everything about space, or read thousands of books. And from what I heard from many alumni, lf you're open minded, you can't pass a day without learning something new at college. :)\n\nFor now, at least personally, it doesn't matter what my future job or wage looks like. I just want to explore life with no regrets, meet people who are just as self disciplined and have drive as I do, and learn as much as I can because applying knowledge into the real world later on is fun! \n\nLeaving my parents home, becoming independent, traveling and adapting to a whole new country alone, even working part-time jobs while maintaining my health and good grades will be hard, but guess what? I value my life way too much to be playing small, and honestly I love working hard because it's an opportunity to grow as a person and learn from life!!

I asked many people why this was and they all told me that it's because believing in a higher power is in the nature of man. As a History Major and lover of mythology, I can safely say there is sufficient evidence for this. However, doubts prevailed as nobody could answer my question \"How do we know this is in our nature?\" The only answers people had for me were \"I don't know\" or \"Why wouldn't He?\" The prevalence of myths and legends no longer sufficed.\n\nRecently, however, I began a Theology course at my college called Creation, Covenant & Christ. I received my answer on the first day and felt compelled to share it with other Catholics who may have felt the same as me. In Genesis when God creates the world, He creates it in 7 Days. This was common knowledge to me, however, a deeper look at the text held the answer I'd been looking for. The original Hebrew doesn't just say God created the world in 7 Days, but He created the world in \"covenant\" (7 is the number of covenant and can be used synonymously. By definition, a covenant is when two parties agree to give their whole selves to each other. Thus, why we can say marriage is a covenant.\n\nGod created the world in covenant. Therefore, he created the world by giving His whole self over to it. Humans are part of this creation, but even more than this, we are made in God's image and likeness. Since we have God's own likeness and are one of His creations, we share in the nature of this covenant. Within our very nature is the desire to give our whole selves back to God, thus humanity has an implicit belief in God and longs to reach out to Him."

It was my first corporate job so I had no idea how to navigate that. She was being nice at first then started isolating me and then people started being rude to me for no reason. I quickly figured out it was her but I was scared and couldn\u2019t do anything. The more I tried to prove I was a good person who didn\u2019t deserve to be treated the way they were treating me the worse it got. They thought I was being fake. \nSo I just ended up leaving after putting up with it and have my reputation ruined for absolutely no reason. And it turns out she\u2019s well connected cause I haven\u2019t been able to find another job in the area and people from my past have been reaching out to me because someone\u2019s trying to dig up dirt on me lol \nI felt and still do feel fcked over and that it\u2019s very unfair but what can you do. \nSome people are weird and twisted like that. \nLife sucks and people can be scary. Your friend is probably jealous of you and that\u2019s why she started all that drama. It happens. \nDon\u2019t let it get to you and focus on yourself, safety and happiness. Always.

It's so much easier to rally behind a moral value than statistics. This isn't to say democrats don't also do this, but it's mostly in response to whatever conservatives have chosen to be mad about.

I'd been in and out of depression for several years before I started developing noticeable symptoms of mania when I got to college. I had a lot of the classic signs like being impatient, irritable, having dissociative episodes, etc., you know the laundry list.\n\nI got my degree in psychology and there's a nagging part of me that insists this influenced things. Self-diagnosis should *always* be avoided, so I decided to go to a psychiatrist before I got too invested in the idea of being bipolar. She seemed to agree after we spoke that I was in fact bipolar, but I knew how I was *supposed* to answer every question to get that diagnosis. I started on lamictal shortly after so I never got to see how it progressed or if it was just me being 19. I've admittedly stopped taking my meds a couple of times to test my theory and ended up delusional, but in the back of my mind there was a touch of lucidity telling me the delusions weren't real which ended up making me doubt everything even more. \n\nDuring my manias I've never done anything so crazy that I would need to be hospitalized for it, I just kind of become an asshole and a bit of a sex and gym addict. Manias aren't even always euphoric for me, I just feel like I have caffeine and cocaine in an IV drip for up to a month. \n\nEven with all this and bouts of intense depression I still wonder if it's all made up and there's nothing wrong with me. I've never been such a risk to people that I need to be admitted, I knew I needed help even when I was manic, and who's to say whether those delusions even counted. This could all be something I came up with to explain away shitty behavior. People can convince themselves of pretty much anything, I would know, I have a psych degree lol. \n\nIt scares me to think that what I've experienced isn't real because it's been hard. I guess I'm wondering if anyone else deals with this every time they take a pill."

However I also have bipolar disorder and find it hard to reconcile the fact that my medications are a shortcut to bypass that suffering. The best way I can explain it is that it feels like cheating, but without them I'm a danger to myself and others. \n\nIt feels cheap to say that I live by Buddhist ideals when I can't even face the suffering bipolar brings me. I practice these teachings with struggles other than mental health, but I don't feel that I can truly embody that mindset when I'm picking and choosing what suffering to address. \n\nDoes anyone else experience this? What are your thoughts?\n\nEdit: Many of you have made good (and comforting) points. My perception of the situation was flawed and self centered. I now know that the most important thing is that I've taken steps towards reducing my suffering in a healthy way and nothing is to be gained by trying to power through these struggles without help.

Anything I need to change, add, or remove? Do the characters' personalities actually match the actual ORV characters?\n\nAnyway, here it is:\n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6aqtb7xf2fw91.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=16e5a6b4ff073e401d5b54338959dfb8b3fbf81e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yslk1z9i2fw91.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0213267cc72432b52abf7dcfcadbdf6b1ecf983c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a0ijymaj2fw91.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=edbf89d304cd640007ea3dcb1de9dda4b0a1e669\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6cg1mddk2fw91.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0a61d783ff11e10a72f3ae232e24cba013c7f20b\n\nThanks!"

My mind is like full of so many emotions but there is also that feeling of emptiness and I cannot even convey in words how I feel right now this novel was such a roller coaster  \nI cried and I laughed and gasped and was on the edge of my seat like so many times! And the way everything just fit in together! Like how much planning would that have required?! AND HOW DID THE AUTHORS EVEN COME UP WITH SOMETHING AS SPECTACULAR AS THIS???!!!  \nThe relationship between all the characters and KDJ and the character development was sooo beautiful which is what made me cry in the last few chapters even more.  \nBut, most of all, the ending though... I don't think anything ever is gonna help me get over it- I am scarred for life.  \n So it's like HSY wrote ORV and we the readers read it and she never finished it, leading the ending to be like that. I can't even...   \nAnd the whole thing of how 1863rd's HSY was tls123 and wrote Three ways to survive in a ruined world just to save one life, Kim Dokja, even if that meant destroying the universe in the future and this whole cycle of how it all started... UGHHHH THAT PART GOT ME! And also YJH 0th turn and KDJ being his '???' sponsor and everything...  \n Kim Dokja sacrificed himself for his companions till the end didn't he?   \nI imagine in my 'ancient dream' thing or so, Kim Dokja woke up and he had all his memories because all the Kim Dokjas from around the universe that read ORV came back or something and wanted to see the proper, happy conclusion, and KDJ met all of <Kim Dokja's Company> and they got one big house and all lived in it happily.   \nI like need to talk about this novel and the ending to someone sooo bad right now but literally no one I know is ever going to probably read this entire novel and understand anything I am talking about so if anyone wants to fangirl with me pleaseeee do so!!!  \nI'm going to write a much longer review on Goodreads, like veryyy long, but I can't right now because my mind needs some time to recover from this before I can write a sensible review because I was just typing anything that came into my mind in this lol.   \nBut anyway, I'm probably just gonna stare at the ceiling for the next few hours or so thinking about ORV and not knowing what to do with myself lol so byee"

I didn't give birth in a hospital either, it was a birthing center and I was the only patient there giving birth that day. I'm not going to lie and say it was easy, my son weighed 9 pounds 2 oz, and it took quite awhile, but the thing was I didn't want to have my child medicated through me, so I was pretty strong willed, and refused any meds. If I had to do it again, I would not change anything. He was a forceps birth, so it was not easy. Do you have someone going in the room with you? If you have learned the breathing techniques for natural childbirth, it should help because it keeps your mind focused. Tell your special person, whoever goes in with you, that if you ask for meds, have them tell you to wait just a few more minutes. That's what I did, so I knew that if needed, I would plow through my first sign of \"weakness\". My son was so big that there was some significant tearing from front to back and the doctor did a crappy job at sowing up my perineum and to this day I still can tell if it's going to rain by the pain in that area. I live in the desert where it rarely rains, and my co-workers used to use me as a weather predictor. Kind of funny, but true. \n\nGiving birth naturally was one of my proudest moments, but everyones situation is different, it is a scary experience no matter what, but it will be okay, just stop overthinking and wait until you are actually in the situation and try not to make any rash decisions.",

At first I took him to a place where he had private tutors and then came home and did most of the work by himself at home. At the time he was at middle school and finished that up quickly. After that I enrolled him in American School, which is a non-profit high school that did all their curriculum through the mail. I'm pretty sure they use computers now, but way back then it was done through snail-mail. He finished the whole high school curriculum within 6 months and then decided, at 13 years old, to go to university with me, and we took classes together. Before I continue with my son's awesome journey, I just really wanted to say that there are alternatives that you may want to look into. Taking my son out of public school was the best decision I made, it worked great for us, and I advise anyone else to look into it to see if it is viable.",

Here is an example of what I've been going through this year: One of my cats died in January of bladder cancer, another died in February of kidney failure. My mom died in March, she had severe Alzheimer's. In April my husband fell and messed up his knee and we are waiting on hearing about surgery. Today is Mother's Day in the USA and my mom is gone and my only child absolutely hates my guts and wants nothing to do with me. \n\nOkay, so putting all that aside. I live in a state where medical marijuana is readily available and it is the only thing that helps with my stomach problems. I have been to doctors and they say the only thing wrong with my stomach is NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), which would not give me any nausea. I was further told that it was stress related. Now that my mom has passed (I took care of her for the last 11 years of her life), my major source of stress is no longer with me, but others are still here. We live in a state that is drying up quickly. Our main source of water is at an all time low and it is also a place where many people are moving to. We know we need to leave before things turn to crap, but we can't find another place in the USA that feels right for us. We are thinking of moving to another country, both of these places have medical marijuana but it is near impossible to get unless you have cancer or some other wasting disease.  \n\nEverything that upsets me, even mildly seems to give me stomach aches, cramps, nausea and diarrhea. About 50% of the time I am also vomiting. I know that stomach issues are pretty common among those on the autism spectrum, but how about HSPs? Is there anyone out there who has a similar experience that has found a medication that helps? Pepto only helps when it is mild. I've tried mindfulness and limiting my diet and relaxation techniques. I suffer from depression, which seems to be worse than usual because of everything I've been through lately."

In February I lost another one of my kitties to kidney disease and this one was my favorite. Her absence has really been felt here at home and it was tough to take. Also, I have been taking care of my mom since my beloved daddy died 11 years ago. I am still not over the grief of losing my father, he was my best friend and was always there for me no matter what. My husband and I had to move in with my mom 5 years ago and I've been through a lot with her. In September she fell and broke her rib and I still took care of her. In November she fell again and broke her hip. I knew I couldn't take care of her anymore, so we put her in the best group home we could find. Only 4 other residents and a private room. In January she started losing it mentally. She just had her 99th birthday on the 16th and she is in hospice care and she will be gone before the months end. Losing my mom, my cats and all the other crap has really affected me. To top it all off, now I need to learn a foreign language because we are going to move to another country next year.

Part of what makes games interesting is the limitations (rules) everyone agrees to. As a game Dev I could create 20 cities with limited homes, players are forced (similar to the real world) to fight over those homes whether it be by commerce, survival, etc. A game can in any way be similar to the real world and the Dev has full control over how difficult it might be for players based on the type of game it is. For example in my example ultra difficult might mean all players fighting for small number of homes and ultra easy all players start with a home. This is one of many examples I can come up with, money is literally use in most games and FIAT \"real\" money can be used in the same way.\n\nAlso you do realise people buy digital goods right? People buy digital music, games, premium content, etc. In games people can create, maintain, trade, etc and all these things can benefit other players. Value is derived from supply and demand, people who think only physical objects can have value are naive. So if your game allows for creation and services there are players that might want to trade real money for it. If you think it's a Ponzi scheme then why do you buy digital games? A game can have $ value to you but not the assets inside the game, doesn't make sense lol.\n\nAlso money itself is printed from thin air, it's not something that always magically existed. Everything bought and sold with money could be considered a Ponzi scheme because if everybody decided to start trading toilet paper the fiat currencies would have no value. The money you have in your pocket came from another \"player\" fyi, not sure how that's a problem either.",

Many people play games they don't enjoy whether it be for the challenge, skill, collectables, story, etc. A lot of competitive games are very stressful to master, people grind on them and even develop not so fun injuries lol. Still theres nothing wrong with that, people have different motivations for anything. Even a random \"fun\" game like bowling, there are people that do it competitivly for money.\n\nAlso it's weird to me when people equate making money as a bad thing. You have a job right, you get paid? Why would you prefer to work 9 - 5 in McDonalds doing something you hate if you had the option to earn money in a game, surely that's a good thing (if it's done in a legitimate way)? I make art / music for fun more so than gaming, I also earn a living from this, just because you make an arbitrary decision that I must now call this work that doesn't mean I can't enjoy it.\n\nSome people actually enjoy their work, usually it's because they're doing something they're passionate about and gaming is something I think a lot of people would prefer to do over their regular job if they had the choice.\n\nAs for Blockchain being a hype idea, well Blockchain will always serve a purpose and has existed a long time but for gaming sure you can say that but it's an opinion and not a fact.\n\nI know that personally that I would rather purchase items that are stored on a Blockchain, that way I could potentially trade them 10 years later instead of Blizzard shutting down their servers and erasing everything.\n\nAlso just to add (because I know people get emotionally triggered at my username lol), I have never bought or sold an NFT so have no biases lol. I think most current blockchains still need a lot of work before I consider using them for a game.",

Its very common for convicted criminals to repeat offend and part of it is they get used to living in Prison, they feel more comfortable with the routine and having their lives controlled by an external force.\n\nDog owners know that dogs make their life miserable, but it's predictable misery. They know every day the dog will cry or bark all day, the dog will need to keep going for exspensive vet visits, etc.\n\nI think they get so used to the routine and they build their identity around that lifestyle. That's why when they lose a dog they're so quick to get a new one, it was never about the dog, it's about maintaining the routine and sense of self, something that keeps their minds preoccupied from the realities of life.\n\nIn a way the dog is both a weaker prisoner they can bully around but also the prison warden they take commands from. Also lastly here's something to think about. When a dog owner is taking their dog for a walk, we tend to be conditioned to think the dog chained to them. These people are literally walking around in chains walking circles in they prison yard (parks)."

Read, because books are deep insights into someone else's thoughts and perspective, even better, read about someone's totally different viewpoint in life than yours. Studying psychology and trauma quickly leads to great insight in why people do what they do. You can practice reading and connecting to facial expressions by observing yourself and movement in a mirror (much like in the early stages of life, people make faces to babies to mirror emotional expressions). \n\nStrengthening your connection to your sensory/nervous system through any physical/somatic practice, yoga, tre, reiki, acupuncture, eft-tapping, as emotions are body sensations... Building more physical safety for yourself allows more subtle sensations to come through. Reflecting and building self compassion does a lot for then becoming better at listening others. \n\nSounds a bit weird, but cultivating a stronger microbiome aids in improved cognitive processes and balanced hormone (emotion) production. Doing any form of creative, unconditional expression. Reflecting on what moves you emotionally the most.

So I can't speak for every woman out there, but in terms of my own experience, it's had a lot to do with my health\ud83d\ude42\n\nWhen I've been mentally in a more difficult, and younger place too, I used to be attracted to those guys who reminded me of my childhood trauma. That was familiar, and mirrored to me what I already believed about myself. I've struggled with self hate, and so if a guy would ignore me just enough and still seem generally kind, I'd think he's really onto something here, he's smart!\n\nThen coming from a healthier place I'd switch nonchalant and not available or caring into\n\n* so curious and passionate about life that their attention is naturally balanced\n* having healthy emotional and social boundaries, emotional intelligence\n* seeing themselves with high value and appreciation, so that occasional external bullshit doesn't derail them, they just peacefully acknowledge that not everyone comes from a healthy place\n* being so busy looking for the funny in life equally in every social interaction, that that gives whomever a chance to admire from afar\n\nSo I'd condense this into: **1** learn to generate internal self appreciation and joy **2** share that energy with every human being\n\nPs. You don't want to attract women that are in the first, unhealthier place I described. That's just an awful social cycle people upkeep and take advantage of. Good luck\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc97",

Yes I think we can be quick to throw advice such as \"put ourself out there\" but it's not very practical is it... \ud83d\ude00 It's really good that you're asking those further questions and actively trying to uncover and understand. That's the most important part, and you'll grow from that before you know it\ud83d\ude0a\n\nSo I'd first tell you to get really clear on the boundaries between introversion, shyness and social anxiety. Learn what the differences are psychologically speaking, so you don't accidentally attach descriptions to yourself that aren't productive. I would say you have some social anxiety territory here as introversion is mostly about the bigger picture, needing to plan for alone time and valuing that too. I know many introverts that are in very active, leadership roles. Just that you don't set unnecessary limits for yourself\ud83d\ude42\n\nBravery is something that's only a learned reaction to situations. Can you tell me as specifically as you can, what would be a situation you'd like to do something in, you haven't yet had the courage to do? How did that situation specifically play out?\n\nIt's good that you recognize yourself as multidimensional, and what's even more beautiful, is that you can trust that every single human you'll ever meet is going to be multidimensional too\ud83d\ude0a\n\nCan you tell more about your quirks?

It may induce some confusion because traditionally it might've been, that to show one's masculinity men would've \"claimed\" their sexuality, and unfortunately some ownership, by throwing some glances. Could it be you're experiencing the contrast to that?\n\nOn the whole the experience on a woman's side still is quite often heavy, and so if I'm tired and don't want to deal with weird stares, I'll be really closed off towards everybody. I can't tell if it's because there is still a prominent group of people that feel entitled to give suggestive or dirty looks, but it takes some social energy to be able to handle that as it can be a bit anxiety inducing. \n\nIn my mind I think if you meet the stare in a respectful way, just acknowledging their presence in a brief manner, that's going to be nice. That works most probably. But remember that the experience on the other gender's side is different.\n\nYeah and compared to regular settings, there are pheromones, tight clothing, close proximity, hormones flowing... It is a bit more physical, sensual environment. But still should be a safe space for people to do sports, and not engage in sexual activity if they choose not to \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f",

But that\u2019s not true. When I get in my car I don\u2019t even remember my seatbelt exists. If I don\u2019t have someone in the car with me, telling me to put it on, I won\u2019t remember that that\u2019s even an option. I\u2019ve started setting a reminder for myself to put my seatbelt on. I feel like an idiot. \n\nSame with most things that non adhd-ers do automatically, like drink water or brush their teeth or eat or close drawers or turn off lights. I regularly walk out of my bathroom and then walk back in an hour later and my drawers are open and my over the toilet cabinet is hanging open. And it\u2019s not like I go \u201chm should I close the drawers? nah,\u201d and then go about my day. It\u2019s just not in my wiring, I have to actively remind myself and remember to do so. \n\nDoing laundry is also really hard for me because I have to go down to the first floor of my apartment complex and I have to remember: my laundry, detergent, keys, and my laundry card. and 80% of the time I forget at least one of those things and have to go back up to my apartment.

I needed it to be soft, preferably acrylic or polyester, have all three colors, and be DK weight. It was impossible. I couldn\u2019t find anything. I ended up having to change my color palette because none of the brands that had sky blue and clay, had yellow. i\u2019m so annoyed. i still haven\u2019t started the sweater because i\u2019m not happy with the yarn color or texture. her birthday is in like 20 days so I have to get going on this. picking yarn is my least favorite part of crocheting. i\u2019m always overwhelmed with my choices and yet they never have what I need. any advice?"

Some of these users found themselves able to solve it by flashing the BIOS, so I, in turn, tried the same. After doing so, I reinstalled everything yet again, and turned it on.\n\nThe good news: it doesn't give me code 51 anymore.\n\nThe bad news: the DRAM debug light is still on, and now the only way I can turn the computer off is by cutting power to the PSU.\n\nSo yeah, not much better.\n\nI've tried everything I could think of, and none of it has worked. At this point, I'm very tempted to just give up on it and either go back to my old motherboard (which still works, it's just some of the USB ports that are dead) or get a different motherboard (not from Gigabyte). Before I do that, though, I figured I should consult with people who have more experience than I do, in case the new motherboard can actually be made to work.\n\n(Also, this whole rant has ignored my *first* attempt with the Gigabyte board, wherein I discovered that my board was dead on arrival, and had to replace it.)\n\nAlso, it's really telling that the only useful documentation I could find were old Reddit posts and an *unlisted* YouTube video from Aorus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRelevant specs:\n\nGigabyte B550 Aorus Master, Ryzen 9 5900x, Gigabyte RTX 3080Ti Vision, G.Skill Trident Z Neo DDR4 (3600 Hz, 32 GB)\n\nPSU Max output: 850 W"

He took the spot of my favourite idol during psychosis to the point I completely forgot about him and the only voice I was hearing from was Harry Styles.\n\nI smashed my phone at the beginning of my episode but three months later when my mum bought me a new one all I listened to was Harry Styles and I thought all his songs were about me. \n\nNow I\u2019m sane it feels like a strange dream that could\u2019ve been real even though I know it\u2019s not.

But the rest of the time the hallucinations were like vivid imaginations that I believed were actually real. So I didn\u2019t really see it but I felt like I was seeing it. Especially because I was 100% deluded into thinking they were actually real. Does this still count as an hallucination?"

My hair is a little lighter in color, about 8 inches longer, and a bit more frizzy it looks like, but if it weren't for those three things, your picture could have been of my hair) and while I am still a complete noob at CG(I don't even have a routine, or good products yet\ud83d\ude05), there are three things that have helped my hair immensely(I don't yet have fully formed, uniform waves or anything, but my hair is so much wavier than it was before, and I don't even use products yet). \n\n1. Not brushing it as much as possible(it breaks the waves, and frizzes up the hair). I haven't yet figured out when the right time to brush it is(I just do it when I'm about to leave the house, or when I really need to brush out the tangles), but the internet says that brushing wet hair is the safest and best for curls/waves (I don't usually do that though, because my hair is super elastic and difficult to brush when it's wet). \n\n2. Not using a towel to dry my hair. Carefully squish out as much moisture as you can, and then: \n\n3. Plopping.  Take a cotton T-shirt (I prefer ones with long sleeves, that way I can use the sleeves to tie the plop), lay it flat on a surface, and gather all of your hair into the shirt. Tie it off, and leave it for a while(times vary. I do mine for at least an hour or two, but my hair takes *forever* to dry. You might not need as long. & I am starting to *suspect* that leaving my hair in a plop all day messes up the waves.  I'd watch some videos on plopping, if you haven't already). \n\nHopefully this wasn't just a bunch of info that you already know lol. \nAnd like I said, I'm a complete beginner, so I'd suggest checking out YouTube(if you haven't already). There are *so many* different resources and styles of curly/wavy hair care to check out! :D\n\nGood luck \ud83e\udd70",

As a Gen Z, I have had *a lot* of nonbinary and trans friends, and I have misgendered a lot of them at least once(especially a childhood friend of mine. We became friends a year or two before he came out as trans, so I met him when he identified with being a girl, so that's what I was used to.  Because of that,  I was very apologetically but  constantly forgetting to refer to him as a guy, for the first few months after he came out). \n\nThey are always chill about it. I have never once had a not chill encounter with one of them(except online, but even those encounters are rare. The childhood friend I mentioned a second ago, was an online friendship, and he was extremely chill about it, despite my repetitive forgetting, which I'm sure was annoying, and possibly hurtful), friend or not. \n\nOne time, my sibling and I were at a party with a bunch of strangers, and my sibling accidentally misgendered someone, who we weren't talking to.  He overheard, and just shouted \"I'm a dude, bro\" across the room. My sibling apologized, he said \"it's cool. Just don't do it again bro\"(yes, he used bro a lot lol).  We later found out that the guy was freshly out of the closet, and was super passionate about trans issues, but even he was chill about it. \n\n\nThe media is the media. It's job is to get clicks. Unnecessarily angry trans people  are going to get clicks from *several* groups(from all sides of the debate). \n\nMost trans people are just trying to live their life in the most comfortable way possible, and part of that for them, is being referred to as a specific gender. They're not going to start a screaming match over being called the wrong thing. They're people just like you and me...not aliens loll \ud83e\udd70",

I honestly don't care about them that much but just the fact that they talk to me regularly. It has become so bad that I judge different people by the number of girls they talk to or are friends with.\nNow I have a theory about why this happened.

All these problems have no solution apart from Armageddon and a complete renewal of society. Why can't I just know whom to trust or not and why can't I just believe what happens on the surface and not try to find any hidden meaning? I see people live in this world, not caring all the bs that's happening around us. How can they do that? I want to help, I want to contribute but as a rich man once said, you have to become a known person for your actions to have a consequence in this world. I see that 99% of the human population are just drones. They just exist for the society to function. I don't want to become like them but I am afraid of having to face failure if I take the risk. And frankly, I am a coward. Now the part for teenage melodrama, I really like this girl and she talks to me too but I feel something is off alwaydls. I don't know why. Yes, there is a fact that we don't have anything to talk about. I think of finding topics to talk about and try to create scenarios so that we can talk but then I realize that I should not have to force or coerce someone to talk to me. That's just pathetic. Well, I am pathetic, so meh. \n\n-Just a tired guy"

Due to this comment I made I was introduced to non-binary (I think that sounds right as a sentence). I didn't say \"someone say they're non-binary.\" but thats how she replied. she then went into asexuality she either said people who Identify as this were confused or dumb (I don't remember). But at the time I was only \"Minecraft is better than fortnite\" years old and didn't know much about the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Bisexuals are confused\"\n\nThis was something said when I was just joking with my older and younger sister (I prefer not to repeat what I said it was dumb). My mom started her mini rant with the phrase above and ended with the phrase below.\n\n\"Bisexuals ruin relationships\"\n\nAccording to my mom bisexual = promiscuous. I would talk to her to help her understand but I can't talk to a rock that only has a mouth to prove it self. She never explains why she believes this she just gives the views out. It's hard for me to respect her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhat will I do?\n\nWell, I did some searching and  aegosexual fits best. That being said I'm not coming out to my mom. I'm gonna go the rest of my life without telling my mom because I don't want to explain it and I don't want to know what she thinks of it."

You shouldn't be thinking defense.\n\nYou eventually need to discard either 5m or 7m, but you wouldn't know which one to discard. After you discard 7m, what if you draw a 6m?

As some have mentioned, there're already similar subreddits but they're dead.\n\nIn your replies in this post, I see that you try to blame the situation on people \"don't even live in the city\". Well, you can look at LIHKG, which is kind of similar to reddit, and definitely mostly used by people living in the city as it's mostly operated in written vernacular Cantonese. The same shift happened in LIHKG as well, where political posts got dominant since 2019. If you want to have no politics, maybe you can click \"\u5a1b\u6a02\u53f0\" in LIHKG which automatically filters out everything except celebrity news.\n\nIt's only been 3-4 years since 2019. 3-4 years is less than 5% of the average life span here. From your reply \"it been 3 years already\", I don't think you understand how short 3 years is. 2019 is still very recent, and also there're many aftermath events keep appearing throughout these few years. Protest-related actions are far from over. For example most of my friends still check whether a restaurant is yellow or blue before going. The signal groups and telegram groups I'm in with other HKers are still dominated by political discussions. To some extent, same for family whatsapp groups as well.\n\nAnyway, overall I'm trying to say that you can try to make such subreddit, but I don't think it'll attract attention, and I don't think \"people not living in the city\" is the reason why.",

For example, studying knots in a class of 3-manifolds called \"lens spaces\" is an active area of research.\n\nIf you want to study knots in higher dimensional manifolds, then you might want to study higher dimensional knots. Knots in R\u00b3 is an embedding of circles in R\u00b3. A higher dimensional analogue would be studying embeddings of spheres in R\u2074. Knotted sphere in 4-manifolds is an active area of research.\n\nOne reason why knots in R\u00b3 get a lot of attention is because it's very closely related to the study of 3-manifolds through the Lickorish-Wallace theorem, which gives a way to construct any (closed, oriented) 3-manifolds you want by starting with a bunch of knots in R\u00b3 and then do something funny with them. At least that's the reason why I need to deal with knot theory a lot when I'm working on something related to 3 and 4 manifolds. Understanding knots in R\u00b3 thoroughly will give mathematicians a lot of access to knowledge about 3-manifolds and to some extent 4-manifolds as well.\n\nBTW, technically we usually consider knots to be in S\u00b3 instead of R\u00b3 because the maths is a bit nicer that way. There's no practical difference though because S\u00b3 is just R\u00b3 together with a point of infinity.",

                "body": " \n\n* How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n   * 20M. I would describe myself as introverted, shy, quiet, brooding, nervous, but somehow also laid back, lazy, slow, curious, impulsive, distracted, and often unsure of myself. I wish I could give a deeper description but I don\u2019t know myself very well.\n* Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?\n   * Depression, anxiety, and ADHD\n* Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n   * To be completely honest, I don't think about too much so I can't give the most detailed account. I think that I had a pretty average middle-class Puerto Rican childhood in the 2000. I was raised by a single mother who is also a doctor. She\u2019s extremely loving and caring about me, sometimes too loving and caring. My family is similarly loving with me and I can\u2019t say a really bad thing about anyone. I never had a particularly stable home. I was born in Mexico but had to move when I was two with my grandparents. I lost my grandmother when I was eight. When I was about 10, my mother got in a relationship with someone and we spent most of our time at his home. Even though I liked my time there, I didn\u2019t see that house as my home and and I always felt that there was always something off about the relationship which I didn\u2019t like. Whether I truly accepted the man my mother was in a relationship as my father I don\u2019t truly know. In the end, the relationship ended badly for my mother. From this time to when I was about 12, mother and I moved a whole lot and she even had to work three jobs to make ends meet. Eventually, when I was 13 or 14, I moved to the US for a year and a half and loved my stay there. Then, I moved back to Puerto Rico because I had always wanted to attend a particular boarding school there. It was during those times that I have my fondest memories. Towards the end of high school and beginning of college, however, I became clinically depressed and suicidal and things only got worse by the day. I had always been a straight a student but depression ruined that for me. I wast until I was medicated about a year ago that things started to improve.\n\nAs for religion, I was always surrounded by it, as my family is catholic but was always in evangelical schools. Still, for all intents and purposes, being religious simply meant saying you believe in God, giving a pretty speech about him every once in a while, and going to church on Sundays if you felt like it. Nowadays I am agnostic.\n \n* What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI\u2019m double majoring in philosophy and history. To be completely honest, I expected to like it more. During my worst years of depression, almost every question I asked was philosophical in some way or another. I was deeply fascinated by it and could spend hours learning it. After a while, for some reason, a lot of the passion died off? It\u2019s still there, but much more weaker. Frankly, the main reason why I\u2019m there was because I was almost kicked out of my computer science degree and decided to start afresh in a career I actually would enjoy(or so I thought).\n\n* If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nThat\u2019s how I spend most of my weekends already. I somehow feel both refreshed and lonely at the same time.\n\n* What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?\n\nI really don\u2019t know myself enough to give a substantive answer. Honestly, I prefer outdoor events but that\u2019s simply because there aren\u2019t many sports I\u2019m into. Stuff like playing chess in a park, a New Year\u2019s outdoor party, being a tourist in a foreign city. Stuff that connects me to other things or people I like. Nevertheless, I hardly go out because most of my interests are indoors.\n\n\n* How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI am quite curious(or so I think). I do have far more ideas than I execute. Even now, most of my curiosities are philosophical or historical. My ideas are very spontaneous, they usually come out of nowhere and once they present themselves to me, I immediately put a lot of effort in investigating it. I am usually captivated by concepts that are outside my understanding, and I research them until I at least have some coherent ideas of it. I\u2019m talking of stuff like Marxism, Anarchism Spinoza, Hegel\u2019s Immanent Critique, etc. I\u2019m not familiar with the environmental/conceptual distinction. \n\n* Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI hate leadership positions precisely because I\u2019m quite bad at them. If I am in one, I\u2019ll have some idea of what I want to achieve and how, so I\u2019ll end up being bossy even when I don\u2019t intend to. \n\n\n* Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nNo, not really. Other than cooking, I\u2019m not good at anything which requires manual ability or labor. Cooking is different because I have done so for fairly long and it just comes naturally. I like cooking because it lets me let out some of my impulses into some creative fashion and few things are as satisfying as a home cooked meal created by myself.\n\n\n* Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nNot at all but I sure wish I was. I suppose I write not bad essays but literally anything else(including other types of writing such as  fiction or poetry) and my mind goes blank. Nevertheless I am fascinated and analyze various forms of art such as film, painting, sculpture, literature even. I guess I just really love art because I value human creativity?\n\n\n* What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nThis is a very complex philosophical question for which I have no satisfactory answer. Is the question asking which I value more or how I think each work? The closest thing to an informed view is that I think there\u2019s something to the phenomenological account of the experience of time, but I can\u2019t quite pinpoint what that is(probably because I haven\u2019t read any phenomenologists). It seems that we do experience the past and future in the present and would not be able to understand it without them. We can only make sense of what is happening based on what immediately preceded it and of what will happen based on what is currently happening. Think of a melody. Can we truly experience it without, in the process, forming expectations of what note will come next? And doesn\u2019t it feel off when a note fails match the preceding one? \n\n*How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nIf it\u2019s in my power to do so, yeah. I\u2019ll try to do it. I don\u2019t have a real reason to do it other than I want to and I want to be nice, if instinct hasn\u2019t taken over.\n\n\n* Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI think everyone needs a little bit of logical consistency in their life, myself included. Nevertheless, I wouldn\u2019t say I value logical consistency any more than I value creativity, spontaneity, insight, practicality, etc. I don\u2019t believe that the universe is rationally structured for humans. Sure, we can quantify and qualify it, but ultimately, I don\u2019t believe the universe has to abide by those laws, as I think of them as artificial mental constructs to find some semblance of understanding in it. As such, I am skeptical of logical consistency as a core value  because of how subject to flaw it is as a mental construct. I am also afraid of how living a perfectly logical consistency can limit the range of human experience. Take for instance falling in love. I saw on an another comment that a perfectly logical lover would find reason to fall in love. I find this position flawed for two reasons: 1)I don\u2019t believe it possible to logic oneself into love(or many other human experiences), 2)it assumes that falling in love is logical. If it isn\u2019t, should we then avoid falling in love at all? Or only when it\u2019s illogical to do? If it\u2019s the latter, then that seems to dismiss the experience of the highest forms romantic love, a deeply enriching experience.\n\n* How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nI\u2019m split on this. Yes, I do deeply value efficiency, to the point of believing in no absolute truth(except my own existence) and only seeing a multitude of perspective each differing simply in how interesting or effective they are for some purpose.  Nevertheless, it\u2019s a dangerous value to have, as, much like with logical consistency, living simply for efficiency can be very limiting and I may be wrong that efficiency is the standard of truth if there is such a thing. Nevertheless, I abhor how productivity has been used as a narrative to manipulate others into valuing themselves only in terms of their work and how much time they put into it. Production should never exceed in value human life(one could argue that it should never exceed any kind of life). \n\n\n* Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI sure hope I don\u2019t but I may be doing it unconsciously. I hate manipulators.\n\n\n* What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nChess, cooking, YouTube, and I\u2019m trying to enjoy reading more. I like chess because of how challenging it and it forces me to think deeply. Cooking is just plain relaxing and very little beats a nice meal cooked by yourself. YouTube is half addiction half hobby. I use simply because I can find interesting stuff there or just to kill time.\n\n\n* What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n\nI don\u2019t believe in learning styles. As far as I know, there is no good evidence to suggest that people learn in any one particularly structured modality. As to what kind of leaning environments I struggle most the most, I really don\u2019t know, but I like studying with music and will hardly ever study without it. I\u2019m not particularly good with classes relying on practical skill and don\u2019t generally like hands-on learning. Everything else fine by me.\n\n\n* How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\nI would like to think that my plans are pretty good or at least not bad. Nevertheless, my plans are quite spontaneous and do come up with them on the spot. My planning process consists on mostly getting clear on what the problem is and what the objectives are and it just flows from there. \n\n\n* What's important to you and why?\n\n\nThis question require so much deep introspection it\u2019d take hours upon hours to even come close to answer it. Furthermore, I may make mistakes in judgements about myself and it may very well be impossible to rationally justify values. Surface level, I value stuff like my family, myself(even if I constantly question my worth), my future, curiosity, creativity, authenticity, spontaneity, life-acceptance, material comforts, love, among many other things. As for why, I really don\u2019t. The common thread I see among them is that they seem to affirm human life in a way that a purely rational utopia(or dystopia) would reject, but there may be something going on in my mind that I\u2019m not aware of.\n\n\n* What are your aspirations?\n\nI have no grand goals or ambitions. I\u2019m afraid that I will fail at them or that I will sacrifice pretty much everything for them and in the process put myself through great, unnecessary suffering. I already did that I suffered greatly. \n\n\n* What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nThe answer to all three is failure. I really don\u2019t know why I hate failure so much especially considering how necessary it is for everything minimally decent in life. I think that my every other fear is boiled down to fear of failure.\n\n\n* What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nThey were probably during high school, cracking jokes with all my friends and struggling on our assignments with them.\n\n\n* What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nMy first three years of college. Those were the times where my mental illnesses were at their worst to the point of being suicidal. \n\n\n* How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure how attached to reality I am, but I am very much a daydreamer. Nevertheless, I am quite aware of my surroundings to the point of noticing things some others can\u2019t.\n\n\n* Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\nProbably myself and what I believe on certain philosophical or emotional matters. Stuff like, \u201cWhy am I so insecure?\u201d, \u201cWhat\u2019s the value of an individual outside it\u2019s social context if there is such a thing?\u201d, \u201cTo what extent do I agree with Harman\u2019s OOO?\u201d, etc. \n\n\n* How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n\nI either take extremely to make it or no time at all, and I\u2019m very much capable of changing my mind on a whim.\n\n\n* How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nIt takes me a hell of a long time to process my emotions. I think that emotions are one of the most important things in my life. I\u2019d say without emotions, there\u2019s be very little worth living for. Emotions, I think, are our fundamental drivers and learning to managing them well is akin to learning to live well. I try to be as accepting and live according to them as much as possible, but it isn\u2019t always possible. \n\n\n* Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\nMore often than not, yeah. I really don\u2019t know why, I just don\u2019t want to be confronted, upset anyone unnecessarily, cause a scene, and a lot of time a confrontation is not worth the trouble.\n\n\n* Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?\n\n\nAs of recently, I\u2019ve been more of a rule-follower. Nevertheless, I do believe authority should always be questioned, especially the more they claim to know. It\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll make progress in anything.\n\n\n* What is the ideal life, in your opinion?\n\nI don\u2019t believe that there is an objectively ideal life. As for my ideal life, I don\u2019t think too much about it so as to make sure I don\u2019t  lose appreciation for my life as it is in the present."

It heats up faster, it\u2019s way lighter, and while cast iron holds heat better, it\u2019s not like carbon steel absolute garbage at heat retention. Sure, cast iron is usually a bit cheaper, but carbon steel isn\u2019t that much more expensive in many cases(I get that you can buy amazing vintage cast irons at thrift stores, garage sales, etc for ridiculously cheap, but I\u2019m not talking about those cases.\n\nEdit: Ok, so here\u2019s what I\u2019m getting\n\n1)For home use, carbon steel may just be more efficient because more thickness means more heat retention, which means it won\u2019t cool down as much when cold food is applied. This isn\u2019t necessary a problem in settings where one has a source of consistent high heat, such as in restaurants, but I don\u2019t such a source other than an oven.\n\n2)Carbon steel seasoning seems to be much more delicate. I remember seeing footage of a well seasoned carbon steel being damaged just by someone cooking onions with lemons on it. \n\n3)Because of its heat retention qualities, cast iron has the particularity of only getting hotter as time goes on, which is why people can achieve steak-searing temperatures on just medium heat.\n\n4)Cast iron also works much better in sources of uneven heat, such in an open flame or grill, since over time every part of the pan will get hot eventually.\n\n5)Again, as the better heat retainer, I imagine low and slow dishes, such as roasts and stews would cook better on cast iron.\n\n6)There\u2019s far more options in cast iron than in carbon steel. Waffle irons, grill pans, aebleskiver pans, Dutch ovens, etc, are all available in cast iron but seldom in carbon steel. \n\n7)There\u2019s also an aesthetic aspect to this discussion. Cast iron looks more rustic but carbon steel looks more professional in my opinion. While I think both look great, I definitely see why someone would choose one over the other. \n\nSo my conclusions are this: if you do a lot of low-and-slow cooking or use an uneven heat source on a regular basis, I\u2019d recommend cast iron. If you do mostly high-and-fast cooking, I\u2019d opt for carbon steel. If you\u2019re still in the fence, it\u2019s frankly a toss up or it boils down personal aesthetics. I lean slightly more towards cast iron because on the one hand, I do mostly high-and-fast, and would like it if cast iron were lighter, but on the other, I still do a lot of low-and-slow, I don\u2019t have a restaurant-high heat, I don\u2019t have to be as dainty with cast iron, and cast iron is generally cheaper. \n\nGet both if possible and use carbon steel for high-and-fast dishes and cast iron for low-and-slow. If you can\u2019t get both, just choose whichever one fits your needs. If you\u2019d like something more readily convenient and are willing to be a bit more high-maintenance, use carbon steel. If you\u2019d rather have something lower-maintenance and more versatile, at the cost of having to preheat it, use cast iron. If you\u2019d rather just use something low maintenance that can suit all your cooking needs that\u2019s also cheap, go for aluminum and non-stick. A step-up from that would be cladded cast iron."

I have seen the game through tickets and through avatar models, through browser and through mobile. You also will find I am quite familiar with pop culture, great for keeping the game fresh for the players while keeping the fun and the features that have made ROBLOX so enjoyable for all of these years. You will find there is no better applicant fit for this position. I would love to have the opportunity to discuss my success in both tycoons and programming that you will find quite qualifying for this position.

Between 10% and 30% of performers quit after one film. The average start is 22 when they start. As an employer that looks bad on paper.\n\nNot to mention the phycological makeup of this portion of the population. Studies have shown that people with \"high sociosexuality and having a large number of sexual partners\" are more likely to rate themselves as lower in the traits of honesty, humility, and agreeableness. \n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/unique-everybody-else/201301/the-personalities-porn-stars\n\n\nJust think of it this way. When an industry is built around the exploitation of people do they go to some prestigious college and look for the portion of the population with a bunch of accolades to their name or do they target the part of the population that is struggling to make ends meet that you can bribe for pennies on the dollar compared to what you can make off their blood sweat and tears? \n\nBut that's just my two cents",

Because that's they're privacy to not let us know. But like in some state laws . We would need a major rights battle  Give the individual people the right to explicitly sell their information. The average person's private data is sold for about $76 or something like that annually. If they want to sell it then the person needs to be asked. If a company refuses to do so then their base code would become open source at their own Free Will. Free and fair for anyone in the public to read and reuse.\n\nThe stuff they make money off of should be open source and free if they don't agree with people's privacy laws and rights. If one contract is broken then that company must pay out damages to that citizen. No longer do payments get paid out to the government. It goes directly to the people. Nobody else. (Can you tell I took a level 100 law class \ud83d\ude02) the damages must be paid out either over time or in a lump sum. I got this idea from the nicehash cryptocurrency breach . They were hacked and they willing paid out of their own profits to repay affected accounts. The last payment I received was a few months ago and it was paid out and had gained \"interest\" cause crypto prices had skyrocketed\n\nBut that simple change could make it so that we are not slaves to our electronics. This could be applied to other companies online and offline as well because this would have implications on the entire field of data analytics itself"

If anyone ever gets this same error just disable forge or if you're using multimc go to edit instances, version, and make sure forge is disabled and fabric is enabled.\n\nHere's the crash message from fabric loader :\n\nA mod crashed on startup!\n\nnet.fabricmc.loader.impl.FormattedException: java.lang.RuntimeException: Could not execute entrypoint stage 'preLaunch' due to errors, provided by 'debugify'!\n\n    at net.fabricmc.loader.impl.launch.knot.Knot.init([Knot.java:164](https://Knot.java:164))\n    \n    at net.fabricmc.loader.impl.launch.knot.Knot.launch([Knot.java:68](https://Knot.java:68))\n    \n    at net.fabricmc.loader.impl.launch.knot.KnotClient.main([KnotClient.java:23](https://KnotClient.java:23))\n    \n    at java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DirectMethodHandleAccessor.invoke([DirectMethodHandleAccessor.java:104](https://DirectMethodHandleAccessor.java:104))\n    \n    at java.base/java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke([Method.java:577](https://Method.java:577))\n    \n    at org.multimc.onesix.OneSixLauncher.launchWithMainClass([OneSixLauncher.java:210](https://OneSixLauncher.java:210))\n    \n    at org.multimc.onesix.OneSixLauncher.launch([OneSixLauncher.java:245](https://OneSixLauncher.java:245))\n    \n    at org.multimc.EntryPoint.listen([EntryPoint.java:143](https://EntryPoint.java:143))\n    \n    at org.multimc.EntryPoint.main([EntryPoint.java:34](https://EntryPoint.java:34))\n\nCaused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Could not execute entrypoint stage 'preLaunch' due to errors, provided by 'debugify'!\n\n    at net.fabricmc.loader.impl.entrypoint.EntrypointUtils.lambda$invoke0$0([EntrypointUtils.java:51](https://EntrypointUtils.java:51))\n    \n    at net.fabricmc.loader.impl.util.ExceptionUtil.gatherExceptions([ExceptionUtil.java:33](https://ExceptionUtil.java:33))\n    \n    at net.fabricmc.loader.impl.entrypoint.EntrypointUtils.invoke0([EntrypointUtils.java:49](https://EntrypointUtils.java:49))\n    \n    at net.fabricmc.loader.impl.entrypoint.EntrypointUtils.invoke([EntrypointUtils.java:35](https://EntrypointUtils.java:35))\n    \n    at net.fabricmc.loader.impl.launch.knot.Knot.init([Knot.java:162](https://Knot.java:162))\n    \n    ... 8 more\n\nCaused by: java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError\n\n    at org.spongepowered.asm.util.logging.MessageRouter.getMessager([MessageRouter.java:150](https://MessageRouter.java:150))\n    \n    at org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.injection.struct.InjectionInfo.register([InjectionInfo.java:805](https://InjectionInfo.java:805))\n    \n    at org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.injection.struct.InjectionInfo.<clinit>([InjectionInfo.java:209](https://InjectionInfo.java:209))\n    \n    at com.llamalad7.mixinextras.MixinExtrasBootstrap.initialize([MixinExtrasBootstrap.java:34](https://MixinExtrasBootstrap.java:34))\n    \n    at com.llamalad7.mixinextras.MixinExtrasBootstrap.init([MixinExtrasBootstrap.java:27](https://MixinExtrasBootstrap.java:27))\n    \n    at java.base/java.lang.invoke.MethodHandleProxies$1.invoke([MethodHandleProxies.java:198](https://MethodHandleProxies.java:198))\n    \n    at jdk.proxy3/com.sun.proxy.jdk.proxy3.$Proxy21.onPreLaunch(Unknown Source)\n    \n    at net.fabricmc.loader.impl.entrypoint.EntrypointUtils.invoke0([EntrypointUtils.java:47](https://EntrypointUtils.java:47))\n    \n    ... 10 more\n\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: class net.fabricmc.loader.impl.launch.knot.MixinServiceKnotBootstrap cannot be cast to class org.spongepowered.asm.service.IMixinServiceBootstrap (net.fabricmc.loader.impl.launch.knot.MixinServiceKnotBootstrap is in unnamed module of loader 'app'; org.spongepowered.asm.service.IMixinServiceBootstrap is in unnamed module of loader net.fabricmc.loader.impl.launch.knot.KnotClassLoader u/79d8407f)\n\n    at org.spongepowered.asm.service.MixinService.runBootServices([MixinService.java:152](https://MixinService.java:152))\n    \n    at org.spongepowered.asm.service.MixinService.<init>([MixinService.java:143](https://MixinService.java:143))\n    \n    at org.spongepowered.asm.service.MixinService.getInstance([MixinService.java:184](https://MixinService.java:184))\n    \n    at org.spongepowered.asm.service.MixinService.getService([MixinService.java:198](https://MixinService.java:198))\n    \n    at org.spongepowered.asm.util.logging.MessageRouter$LoggingMessager.<clinit>([MessageRouter.java:52](https://MessageRouter.java:52))\n    \n    ... 18 more"

However it could be that I had a lot of fun that day and also I was doing a music project that I felt really passionate about.\n\nNot so obvious ones are for example: \n- I don't know how to call this one. Something like really minor hallucinations but it's hard to explain. The best way to describe it is jumpy vision.\n- Really weird mindset which is yet another thing that I don't know how to call yet. Kind of like zoning out a lot but just for brief seconds.\n- Just remembered another thing. I'm wanting to do drugs. This one is tricky too since I use drugs rarely but also remember that when I was hypo last time I really spiralled into destructive drug abuse. \n\nWish I could name some more but right now it's hard for me to recall other \"symptoms\" that worry me.\n\nI hate it that I don't know how much of my head is healthy stuff and how much is not so healthy.\n\nAlso drank coffee and feel like I'm going fucking mental."

From my observation it's much more dangerous than any other epsiode. Speaking from experience during depression suicidal thoughts creep in slowly and evolve into actions. On the other hand while you're mixed, mania makes it that once you get the thought of committing suicide you just automatically go and try to do it. No time to think, no time to react from you or close ones. Since it's so random it's also almost impossible for people close to you to notice that anything's going to happen. At lest that's how it was for me.\n\nIf you wish share your thoughts on this subject."

Sorry if I sound ignorant, but I just want some clarification on this.\n\nEdit: i just want to clear up a misunderstanding. A lot of people here seem to think I am associating God with the Christian God. This is not true. I try to separate myself from Christianity as the religion is mostly based on fear and control. I know this from personal experience. I believe that God is one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively through us. What I was asking is how it is even possible that we can contact source if it is everything at once. Thankfully, there are many people here who had great answers, but i just wanted to my point clearer."

Will she rule alone so no man takes her power and never wed? Will she lose her virginity? \n\nAccording to the Vale plot, it seems like everyone wants her and she is coming into her own, but above all marriage and reproduction seem somewhat inevitable at the current stage, so could GRRM make a virgin queen of the north/lady of winterfell/the vale/something?\n\nEdit: yep, I forgot that she is not a virgin in the show, deleted that from my brain somehow."

I know UPS is freakishly expensive too.

Paid a little extra to have it delivered straight to his house, but that only added $4. I also had it expedited for an extra $3. In total the fees and delivery service for 2 items added up to $20 and they were super responsive on WhatsApp throughout the whole process.\n\nIf anyone wants to send friends or family items I'd definitely recommend this service.

I really want to go about this the best way possible. I know you need to show strong home ties, and he has a big family that he is close to and supports, a really good job, and he's been to Europe and returned in the past. \n\nThe problem is that (again, thanks COVID!) he's very low on funds right now. As much as I'd like to think I can just pay his way, I assume the government will want him to be financially independent. I also understand that it's not ideal to mention he's visiting his gf in the interview.\n\nDoes anyone know how much money he'd need to show proof of in his bank account? Or have any general advice about the application and interview? Anything would be appreciated!"

It's a cancerous sweat gland; localized cancer. The only way to get rid of it is to cut it out. This left her face disfigured. Back when I was 14, I realized the gravity of the situation, but I didn't let it bother me as bad. I thought it was just a one-time thing I guess. Fast forward to late January 2019 and my dad gets up and leaves, leaving a lot of his belongings here as he goes and lives somewhere else. When he left, I was like \"oh, he'll be gone 2 weeks tops.\"\n\nMy dad and I never had a functional relationship. Like he never took me to do dad and son activities. I was always closer to mom.\n\nIn January 2020, my mom had a heart attack that almost killed her. It was due to the chemotherapy drug. Afterwards, the cancer started eating a hole in her face and there was necrosis. She had to go under the scalpel again. When she woke up from anesthesia, she couldn't speak and could only use a whiteboard and an Expo marker. She wrote on the whiteboard, a wave symbol, and scribbled she couldn't breathe. She had to be put in a medically-induced coma. My grandma, in shock, told me this over the phone, while I was at my other grandparents house, and I start crying, I didn't sleep pretty much at all for the 17 days of eternity it felt like that she was in the hospital, so much so, I started having hallucinations. These hallucinations were so scary, but I was so out of it due to sleep deprivation. I started googling shit and thought i had some mad cow disease and started grieving my own existence, thinking I was dying... man I'm so anxious typing this out I might faint. my hands are tingling. I have more to say, but i need to stop. Thanks for reading."

I definitely don't think the abuse I went through was my fault, I meant more that who I am right now, the choices I make that still cause me troubles, would be my fault. But I guess if those things stem from what I went through, and if I think that what I went through wasn't my fault... then I don't necessarily have to blame myself for them... and you're probably right on the gaslighting..",

Perhaps I've propagated it in my surroundings, it's probably the only way I can properly connect with someone. Then again I wouldn't be able to tell how that would compare to \"LSI banter\" as I'm not entirely sure what it looks like.\n\nI've heard that one of the main reasons certain types are considered rare is simply because they're less likely to participate in groups the way the more \"common\" types do, therefore participate less in typology communities and would rather learn on the side rather than meddle in. A typist made that observation about SLI particularly. \n\n\"EII needs to be pushed to do things too, but at a workplace they shouldn't have any problems with discipline\", 1 point to EII. \n\nI got INFP on the card test. Second choice is ENFJ. \n\nI'll look more into EIE (although I've looked at the model G subtypes, and none really fit), and marinate in it a bit more. I've found that distance usually helps to gain new insights. Thanks for your help!",

I'm in my early 20s, and \"slandering\" or insulting your friends imo is just a generational thing. I'm aware that some people from this generation also don't like it, but I'm not sure it's specific to type. Otherwise a lot of people would be LSI lol. \n\nAnd for the morals bit, it's half and half really. I think both. I've gotten into arguments with my mother about a lot of her convictions, but I feel as though most of it was morally driven. For example I don't think caring about people on an emotional level is \"illogical\", not everything has to be dry and devoid of emotion. Something I've been told is very \"F>T\" which I actually find quite ridiculous. Many Philosophers preached treating people with kindness, pushing morals, and most of them are typed as \"logical\" types. So something doesn't really make sense here. My father is the smarter person I know, a successful scientist, and he also cares about people as people. Not as objects. We're humans, how is caring about the welfare of our species \"illogical\"? Just sounds like an excuse for individualism. \n\nI tend to think people are stupid, yes, I also tend to think they're horrible. It's a mix of being horrified by their morals and not understanding how one could even think that way.",

I think I'm contradicting myself quite a lot, but I don't know if I'm unable to create comfortable environments, I just haven't particularly noticed myself do it. I probably have done it, I'm just not entirely sure what to \"look\" for as this seems to be quite... abstract... \n\nRational is Judging in socionics, right?\n\n1. I have not, no, I'm a very mellow person and would never even think to get physical (unless playful wrestling with one's partner), but no I never use physical force. \n\n2. I don't really have a specific ambition, I just want to be better at being \"me\" and learn different skills, become smarter, a better person. Slowly but surely. I'm not particularly in a rush. I want to work in a job I enjoy and have passion for. I want a comfortable life. \n\n3. I'm not competitive, no, in that case I'm also quite mellow. I've been in a competition and all it did was stress me out. I like being inspired by people that are better than me, and I'll use that to push myself to be as good as them, but never in a competitive way.\n\n\nAbout IEI being attracted to people who push them to succeed, I wouldn't say that's too far off from me.

                "body": "Hi, I'm just posting this because I finally decided to try therapy. Well, I kind of tried exactly same time last year but I think I was too scared then and I never contacted the therapist again. I've only had two text sessions, text because I know if I did a phone call or video call I just... wouldn't talk. \n\nI'm having doubts as in... Part of me doesn't see the point in talking about my problems and someone trying to walk me through them. Because I've walked through them my whole life. Tried to understand them, tried different practices, I've managed to convince myself that I can just help myself. But I'm really trying to ignore those thoughts and just stick with it. \n\nToday was quite rough though. I hadn't thought about my childhood in a few months, but at work today I kind of spiralled into grieving for the childhood I never had, one I could've had without all the bullying I went through, the abuse, everything. I think this is why I'm scared of therapy, I'm scared the only thing it might do is open wounds I've tried so hard to mend. But maybe that's the point? Mending the wounds While they're open? It's weird, I feel like... whenever I think back through the worst times, I don't feel anything anymore. And I don't know if I'm just over it or if this is my brain protecting myself. Well, I feel something, maybe sad, then it fades away even though the thoughts are still there. It's odd. Idk there's so much to unpack.\n\nI haven't mentioned the abuse I went through yet, all we've talked about is my low self-esteem and how I grew up with a lot of pressure to be \"smart\" like my dad and brother. But there's just so much to talk about. And I don't know if I want to talk about it even though I really need help. Idk I'm just venting now. But it's scary. Eh. Then I think ehhh it's fineee I'll be fineeeee!!!"

                "body": "\nSection 1\n\n1. How do you work? Why do people go to work? Are there any parameters that determine whether you can do work or not? What are they?\n\n\nI work with outbursts of energy unless I can get myself into a routine. I generally like clear instructions in order to do my work efficiently.\n\nPeople go to work mostly to provide for themselves in a world that demands we contribute to society in some way, but I do believe we wouldn't stop working if it wasn't necessary to survive. We seem to enjoy either working for ourselves to keep ourselves busy, satisfied, fulfilled, or enjoy participating in a community (something I don't do, just what people seem to like) \n\nWhether one can work or not is usually determined by their ableness, that is lack of disability. Makes me think of a conversation I read about \"high functioning autism\" only being considered high functioning on a scale of \"are they able to work?\"\n\n\n2. How do you determine the quality of work? How do you determine the quality of a purchase? Do you pay any attention to it?\n\nThe quality of work is determined by the standards imposed beforehand, and whether or not the work meets those standards\n\nNot too sure about the quality of a purchase, I'd check good and frantically look for bad reviews, cross reference with different products, and whatever has the least bad reviews... wins\n\n3. There is a professional next to you. How do you know they are a professional? How do you evaluate their skill?\n\nJust looking at them, I'd imagine they're behaving in a \"professional way\", aka in the most robotic, void of any authenticity, most detached way possible. Same as the quality of work, their skill has to match a predetermined standard \n\n4. If you struggle to do something, how do you fix that? Do you know if your performance is better or worse than others?\n\nI tend to overfixate on fixing whatever isn't working, but that usually doesn't work. So I usually take a big step back, take my mind off of it before I can get back to it.\nI'd know if my performance is better from comparing my work to theirs, seeing if I used all the required techniques, seeing where they went wrong and what I could've done better\n\n5. How do you measure the success of a job? What standard do you use? Do you pay attention to it? When should you deviate from this standard?\n\nIf you're working underneath someone, the success of that job would be getting your superior's approval. I use whatever standard is given to me, when I first start a job I usually do more than what's expected of me to make a good impression, and I don't slack off at work. I tend to slightly deviate from that standard if I have no supervision keeping me in check every one in a while. I'd still feel guilty and paranoid about looking like a bad employee so that's why I try not to deviate.\n\n\nSection 2\n\n1. What is a whole? Can you identify its parts? Are the parts equivalent to the whole?\n\nA whole is...the sum of its parts? Its parts make up the whole? The parts are equivalent to the whole if... all the parts are there?\n\n2. What does \"logical\" mean? What is your understanding? Do you think that it correlates with the common view? How do you know you are being logical?\n\nLogical means that all the premises in an argument are true, if one of the premises is not true, then the conclusion cannot be true, then it's not logical. \n\nI don't believe the common view is usually logical at all, but I really don't put that much emphasis on logic anyway. I guess you know you're being logical when you have all of the information you need in order to make a sound conclusion, trying not to let personal biases affect you in the decision. Which is basically impossible but that's another topic. (You know, personal biases being all that we are as humans since we're shaped by our culture and environment from the day we are born so nothing is ever objective? yea)\n\n3. What is hierarchy? Give examples of hierarchies. Do you need to follow it? Why or why not? Explain how hierarchy is used in a system you are familiar with.\n\nA hierarchy is the organization of a group into different statuses. A hierarchy can be found in governments, President > Vice president >....etc, at work, CEO > General Managers > Assistant Manager > Supervisor > Employees... \nThey do need to be followed in order for society to function the way it does today, it's a flow that keeps everything going as smoothly as possible. \nThe top goes to the bottom, and the bottom goes to the top \n\n4. What is classification? How does classification work? Why is it needed and where is it applied? Give examples.\n\nA classification is the organization of information into different groups, the organization can be determined by factors such as similarities between the information. \nFor instance we can take the biological classification system, we identify whether or not certain animals belong in specific groups if they fit the characteristics of the group. If a bird has wings, and the animal in front of us does not have wings, the animal isn't a bird.\n\n5. Are your ideas consistent? How do you know they are consistent? How do you spot inconsistency in others' ideas?\n\nI do like spotting inconsistencies but I don't genuinely care about them. I don't particularly strive to have consistent ideas, I'd feel as though I'd never learn and grow from the way I think. When arguing, I'll contradict myself because I wouldn't have one way of thinking. I'd think back about what I said and change my mind. \n\nSection 3\n\n1. Can you press people? What methods do you use? How does it happen?\n\nI don't like pressing people, when I do, I try to do it as lightly as possible. However I can turn bossy when I'm stressed and in a bad mood and just want something done as quickly as possible, but I don't enjoy it and usually feel guilty as I do it. \n\nAn example of the light way: the other day I \"jokingly\" asked a colleague to put trolleys back (his job) because they were obstructing the road and I wasn't gonna do his job for him while he was sitting there. As much as I meant it, and as much as it worked, I tried not to sound pushy. \n\n\n2. How do you get what you want? What do you do if you have to work to get what you want?\n\nI don't tend to assert myself to \"get what I want\". If I have to work I'll just try to do the best job possible, but I'm not competitive at all and if I don't get it then that's fair. \n\n3. How do you deal with opposition? What methods do you use to defend your interests?\n\nI don't see people as opposition, we're here for the same thing and if they get it before I do then that's great for them. Those really aren't things I spend any energy on, I mostly just go with the flow of things and let them fall into my lap, sort of. \n\n4. When do you think it's ok to occupy someone's space? Do you recognize it?\n\nSomeone's space? Physically? Theoretically? It's always okay, I'd think, if the space is vacant and a job needs to be done, sure. As long as they get their space back, I don't see an issue. But if the job is done better then they might not get it back, that's fine too.\n\n5. Do others think you are a strong-willed person? Do you think you have a strong will?\n\nNo, I have a very easy-going will. Whatever comes my way, I'm where I've always wanted to be and I guess that did take some work, but I'm not particularly strong-willed. \n\nSection 4\n\n1. How do you satisfy your physical senses? What examples can you give? What physical experiences are you drawn to?\n\nI'm drawn to sleeping way too much. I like snuggling up in a blanket and having a cup of coffee. I really enjoy smells as well like certain perfumes. I like certain tastes. \n\n2. How do you find harmony with your environment? How do you build a harmonious environment? What happens if this harmony is disturbed?\n\nA quiet space, but I don't really build it, I just retreat into my zone. I'm quite sensitive to noise, I can blast music in my ears but it doesn't usually last very long because of how much it drains me. So I'd say I'm sensitive to the noise of the environment. \n\n3. What does comfort mean to you? How do you create it?\n\nI'm comfortable when I'm in my bed and my body temperature isn't too warm. My body weirdly gets warm really easily and it's horrible, hot flashes, my partner says I'm living radiator. So a cool bedroom is comfortable.\n\n4. How do you express yourself in your hobbies? How do you engage yourself with those things?\n\nI sometimes play the guitar and sing, I guess that's a form of self-expression. I keep it all to myself and would be way too embarrassed to share it with anyone. I've got a few songs but they're all very mellow and sad. \n\n5. Tell us how you'd design any room, house or an office. Do you do it yourself, or trust someone else to do it? Why?\n\nVery minimalist, I'm thinking of maybe an art studio. A desk with loads of storage, an armchair and table by the side for breaks and reading, the other side for painting. No one else gets to touch it, and I wouldn't want anyone else to design it. It's too personal.\n\nSection 5\n\n1. Is it acceptable to express emotions in public? Give examples of inappropriate expression of emotions.\n\nI'd say it's acceptable to express emotions in public yes, it's not something I'm personally very comfortable with depending on the emotion and I tend to \"avoid\" people with grand emotions but I don't think emotions are inappropriate. \n\nMaybe because I used to cry a lot as a kid and a teacher took me out of the class to tell me \"there's a time and place to cry\". Which I didn't really understand, I didn't choose when I cried.\n\nPerhaps anger might be inappropriate sometimes. Losing your shit over very small things, putting yourself in danger on the road because someone cut you off. But that's just stupid. \n\n2. How do you express your emotions? Can you tell how your expressions affect others in a positive or negative way?\n\nEhhhh it depends how close I am to someone, if they've gained my trust I openly share emotions, I've been told my eyes light up when I talk about something I'm excited about. When I'm sad I just sort of shut down and I don't talk to anyone so I'd say that's very private. \n\nI'm trying to think of how my emotions affect other people and I really have no idea. Unless someone tells me directly how they feel I have no way of knowing. Not to sound selfish but I'm often a bit too caught up with myself. \n\n3. Are you able to change your demeanor in order to interact with your environment in a more or less suitable way? How do you determine what is suitable?\n\nIt's something I've had to work on... a lot. I work with customers all day and it's sooo difficult for me to act like a nice, bubbly person who definitely wants to help! Because I don't want to help! Again I do change depending on who I'm talking to, not because I'm changing for the environment, but because I don't trust people with the whole \"me\" until I've gotten to know them. \n\n4. In what situations do you feel others' feelings? Can you give examples of when you wanted to improve the mood of others?\n\nUnfortunately I rarely feel that, I'm not a big empath and I think protecting myself from other people's emotions is something I learned as a child being around explosive people. It's difficult for me not to detach myself from how they're feeling, I'll be sympathetic of course and give them advice if they want some, but I won't feel \"empathy\" in the sense of feeling their emotions.\n\nI want to help, but I'm not sure how. I wasn't really taught how and it doesn't come naturally. If someone's sad I'll usually try to distract them or lighten the mood somehow. \n\n5. How do others' emotions affect you? How does your internal emotional state correlate or contrast with what you express?\n\nA bit like the last question, they don't affect me much. Depending on the person they might irritate me, but that's quite rare really. I don't \"kill the mood\", if someone is happy I'll try my best to join, but it's difficult to fully express emotions. Depending on who I'm with, I can either let loose and act really happy, or be really happy and excited inside and act very aloof. People who don't know me usually just see me as aloof \n\n\nSection 6\n\n1. How can you tell how much emotional space there is between yourself and others? How can you affect this space?\n\nI don't think that's something I pay a lot of attention to. Emotional space? Like being comfortable sharing sad emotions? Or emotions in general? I don't affect it either, I'd have no idea where to start \n\n2. How do you determine how much you like or dislike someone else? How does this affect your relationships?\n\nIf I dislike someone I get this massive.. distrust and disgust. If I like them, I'll be happy whenever I see them and I'll want to talk to them a lot. I guess I don't interact with people I dislike and I try to interact alot with the ones I like.\n\n3. How do you move from a distant relationship to a close one? What are the distinguishing characteristics of a close relationship?\n\nOoof I don't know! It's a very slow process to me and it doesn't really happen consciously. I don't think there are set characteristics, it varies from person to person. \n\n4. How do you know that you are a moral person? Where do you draw your morality from? Do you believe others should share your beliefs on what's moral? Why?\n\nI know I'm a moral person if I act in a virtuous way. Of course virtue is subjective to the individual, and I've had my fair share of justifying myself and certain actions my own morals. I do think I have quite a good set of morals and that people would be better off sharing them, I know that this is naive but to me they seem like common sense. \n\n5. Someone you care about is acting distant to you. How do you know when this attitude is a reflection of your relationship?\n\nWhen people get \"distant\" I usually assume they're just busy at the moment. I can go months without talking to someone, doesn't mean our relationship is affected. I guess it'd be bad if I tried to talk to them and they intentionally ignored me, but other than that... it's fine. \n\nSection 7\n\n1. How can you tell someone has the potential to be a successful person? What qualities make a successful person and why?\n\nReally depends on what you'd mean by successful. I guess what you'd need is assertiveness, and some confidence. The talkative and sociable people might be more successful, they'd have no issue networking and building connections.\n\n2. Where would you start when looking for a new hobby? How do you find new opportunities and how do you choose which would be best?\n\nLook at different sources, how other people have done it, familiarise myself with the concepts and the general idea and slowly get into it. I'd know which opportunities would be best if they fit into the idea I want for my life. I don't actively look for them either, though.\n\n\n3. How do you interpret the following statement: \"Ideas don't need to be feasible in order to be worthwhile.\" Do you agree or disagree, and why?\n\n\nHalf and half. \nIdeas can bring hope, and in that sense, ideas can be worthwhile if people are willing to work with the hope they have to fulfill the idea. Like making the world better, it'll never be perfect, it's not feasible for it to be perfect, but if we stopped believing in the idea of a better world, we'd stop working towards it. \nBut unfeasible ideas without hope aren't worthwhile, no one wants to work on something that's downright impossible.\n\n\n4. Describe your thought process when relating the following ideas: swimming, chicken, sciences. Do you think that others would draw the same or different connections?\n\n\nSending chickens to swim (in swimming costumes) and scientists running experiments on how... chickens swim in different conditions and different types of liquids, maybe certain chickens are better at swimming and trying to correlate good swimmers to better food, how healthy they are, how valuable they are as chickens.... \nI'd say they'd draw the same connections\n\n\n5. How would you summarize the qualities that are essential to who you are? What kind of potential in you has yet to be actualized and why?\n\n\nI wouldn't say I have essential qualities. I'm always changing and I would not want to be static. I feel like I have a lot of unlocked potential that, if I properly worked on it, I'd fulfill it. Like being productive, being a much better artist, and basically being ... smart. \n\n\nSection 8\n\n\n1. How do people change? Can you describe how various events change people? Can others see those changes?\n\n\nPeople grow up, go through life, sometimes trauma, breakups, grief, even just different jobs, move to another country. Those things change people and sometimes how they go about life. I don't know if others can see them, everyone is way too concerned with themselves to genuinely care, right?\n\n\n2. How do you feel and experience time? Can time be wasted? How?\n\n\nI feel as though time is happening to me, as though I am a victim of time and vulnerable to the fact that it never stops. But I'd like to think time isn't wasted. although that's because I waste time all the time. I'd say we waste time when we engage in things that do not truly bring us anything worthwhile. What does binge watching a show bring me, really? Will I remember every single episode? Did they teach me anything? Do I feel like a better person having finished it? No. Then I wasted my time and feel guilty about it.\n\n\n3. Is there anything that cannot be described with words? What is it? If so, how can we understand what it is if language does not work?\n\n\nNothing can truly be described accurately with words. We only ever understand concepts and definitions that we've imposed onto the world, not the world itself. Language only works in sharing a concept to another person, so language never really works. And even when sharing this concept, we can never know if the recipient will understand it the way we understand it. \n\n\n4. How do you anticipate events unfolding? How can you observe such unfoldments in your environment?\n\n\nSometimes I have a feeling that something might go wrong, but it usually comes from looking at my environment and catching onto a flew clues.

How do you know the time is right to act? How do you feel about waiting for the right moment?\n\n\nTrusting your guts, I guess. I can't really think of a specific situation, but I'm starting to learn that yes, waiting is important, but more often than not your guts know what to do and we should trust them."

She would isolate us and show us our worst nightmares one by one, in the worst ways possible. She appeared in the shape of a woman head with very long thick black hair (possibly wavy) and two very long thin arms, very thin fingers with long nails, attached to some... long black thing that served her as her body, it was quite blurry, we couldn't see her face either. Her face was pitch black. I might draw her. \n\nOur job was to eliminate her, I believe.

I have a complicated history and I my opinion, I need cognitive retraining (growing up with a drug abusing parent who doesn\u2019t respect boundaries at all, and a mother who doesn\u2019t know how to set boundaries and is afraid of negativity). \n\nI have adhd (the psychologist also acknowledges this and primarily focuses on this), BUT - I\u2019d very much like to focus on my symptoms of mild social anxiety. It massively impacts me how others view me, I don\u2019t even feel that I can be truly myself around my family and see judgement around every corner/overthink crazily. \n\nShe even mentioned mild social anxiety in the end of the 1st session. Today she kept talking about structure, jobs and future education etc. I didn\u2019t feel it was as relevant as my other problems: so I brought up that I\u2019d like to stop never feeling good enough. \n\nHer response? \u201cThat every young person is like that\u201d (21F). I felt like she kind of shrugged it off, and I feel like she should look at my up-bringing, she even knows what\u2019s up! She should be able to see that I have unhealthy thinking patterns, but she keeps returning to \u201cplanning/structure\u201d.\n\nNow, she\u2019s going on maternity leave in the summer (I live in Denmark and we have long maternity leaves, + my therapy is free). That means I\u2019m getting a new therapist, and also I\u2019m scheduled for a psychiatrist in the summer, to prescribe me meds etc (maybe she can help aswell). Should I just be patient and let things play out?\nAm I overreacting? I broke down crying on my way home, she wasn\u2019t even \u201cunreasonable\u201d so it is a bit of a strong reaction.\n\nIt feels as if there\u2019s no \u201cclear direction\u201d or plan."

                "body": "So recently i heard rumours or truth idk about my ex(one i had zero contact for like almost 2 years, cuz i just moved on from her) , that her boyfriend abuses(verbally) and sometimes slap in public too. Maybe nudes were leaked. Could be blackmailing her. Things like that , and one day i went to park like early and saw her walking in their talking to her boyfriend on call.  Then she sat down , cuts call and sits on a bench and started crying ,her friend came and sat with her . Then she stopped crying and started walking around the park with her . I was sitting on the opposite corner watching all this. \n\n\nSo i got little worried , even though she was the one who left me very bad for that guy. So i started walking too , she approached me when we crossed each other, said you were nice and i am not kidding you really were. I said fine , but i don't know how to react to this now. Now i was walking beside her , she asked you must single for sure , till now . I said \"that don't bother me at all , and i am happy\". She then grabbed my arm asked to walk with her . My first Instinct was to deny and so i did . She said i will be bored walking alone , since her friend is leaving . I denied still and left . But suddenly i felt worried so i approached her and said ok i will. She was continuously grabbing my arm and i was not comfortable with that and asked her not to . She said walk slow or i will , i started walking slow , but she wanted to grab my arm. But i also had a side that hated her so much ,and  kept making me uncomfortable to let my arm in her hands. so i  Moving on, I then asked her , what is it that you were crying , is it what rumours say . Are you getting blackmailed and couldn't leave her . She couldn't speak that time cuz her eyes were kinda red so just nodded her head(yes) . I asked a little more and said i won't ask much cuz i don't think you will be good with that rn . So i asked her to sit and talk on a bench . I made her laugh and all , like elevated her mood. I then went home .\n\n\nI contacted my friend , and explained him that . Decided to beat the fuck out of him . I contacted my ex on chat and asked her , if she want i could help her and she won't have to worry about anything , just have to say \"i need breakup\" if needed. No consequences , nothing . She will be freed . He won't blackmail you or anything . She denied , she said , that neither her nudes are leaked nor he is blackmailing her . I said there's no need to worry about , just tell up straight , he won't even contact you . She still said there's nothing like that , just insecurities , little fights, misunderstandings and nothing more. I didn't knew , what to believe and what to not . She said thanks and not to worry about . But i know there's something still. She is not accepting . Denying and saying she is happy and all , also thanks for worrying about me. \n\n\nNext day i was with my friends , and one of them saw her walking around the park ,  one she abused yesterday very bad in the evening(i was not around but other friends were) both had fight with each other . So then this time my friend started teasing her (verbally) , asked her to tell the truth what's going on her relationship , what things he tells her to do , how he slapped you in middle of your classes and abused you on your mouth , why you are still with him? Cuz he wealthy or what etc. She didn't spoke about that , just cussed him and moved on walking . I then asked him not to fight or say anything like that on road and just don't say it at all around me atleast . Some distance apart from the park she called me there , i went and then she started blaming it on me , saying why didn't you stopped him (her eyes were red and water) , i should be the one to help me . I said that it's between you two , you abused him yesterday very bad , i won't and it's not my responsibility , i am no one to help you , also i just told him not to say things again, and he won't . But i am no one to stand in front of you . She said we had things years before , so you should have helped me . Am i not your friend? I said \"no!\" , we are not , i cleared you long ago , that we don't have any bond between us if you think we have . I can't be your friends after breaking it up (actually she didn't even said she need breakup , she just started going out with him , ghosting me and felt like we never had anything ). She said \" oh , you were the guy the guy who asked me me to help me with my boyfriend, i will do this and that, and now what?\" . I said \"it's your boyfriend's responsibility to fight for you not mine , i asked to help you , cuz no one could help you with him , so i did . I am no one to stop every other guy who asks you same things that he did , cuz you were no telling me the truth or anything and every other guy who know you tells me the same things , but you don't accept\" she said \" i see i am no one to you and you let him speak to me like that even though it was so shameful for me, see zi don't wanna talk to you now\" and left. I don't know i feel like an ass , i don't know what to process . Idk if I was wrong . Was i fine by my side or do i suck . Sometimes I feel like i should have kept the ghosting phase going like it was. Ahh . Need your advice/opinion/thoughts."

Last june I lived in Ecuador (after having lived in Europe all my life) and I had a spontaneous eardrum perforation while we were driving the car from higher to lower altitudes. It ruined my stay on the Galapagos islands because even snorkling was very painful. I never went to an ORL specialist with it (I would have to wait over half a year before getting an appointment anyway). It healed spontaneously, although I feel like my ears are more sensitive now whenever I have a cold. When I was a kid I also had ear perforations and otitis media, leading me to believe that my eardrums have become very sensitive to pressure. I'm just wondering if it's a good idea at all to pay for this activity while I fear this might happen again...? Does anyone here have had the same experience with eardrum perforations in the past?\n\nEdit: thanks for all the advice, I think I won't scuba dive! Many of you tell me I should have seen a doctor but I had some reasons not to, first of all I graduate from medicine myself in a week, I am not becoming an ORL specialist though. Second of all when I came back from Ecuador the pain was already gone. Third my father is a neurologist and during winter I let him check my ears with his otoscope whenever I had a cold but he never saw anything out of the ordinary. And fourth it takes over half a year to even sometimes a year in my country to get a first appointment with a specialist. Fifth I do know treatment would have been conservative anyway, especially since the problem resolved itself when I came back from Ecuador. I do appreciate the big amount of advice here, I think scuba diving isn't the best idea for me so I decided I won't do it. Many of you will probably think I'm stupid for even asking this question, but even a friend who will specialize in ORL next year (she did her co-assistency) couldn't answer me if this would be a recurring problem and whether I should try it or not. So I thought maybe you experienced people maybe knew some people who have had this as well in the past."

He's been hospitalized several times. Lately I feel like I care less about my education, it may be that I'm subconsciously experiencing a lot of stress and my coping mechanism is me telling myself that I don't care anymore, I don't really know why I feel less stress than I used to. Like I studied medicine for 6 years and put A LOT of effort into it and I'm so close to graduating and choosing a specialization, but I have upcoming exams and I do nothing for it. And I stay up all night till the morning, not that I need to sleep less hours but my brain is crazy active and trying to distract me being on the internet and stuff.  And I recently have been thinking maybe I want to not specialize and go study something else, like screen writing or movie production because I feel very creative. And I am very disturbed by this. I mean it's just a thought to quit medicine, I don't think I will actually do it. \n\nMaybe I am a bit of a hypochondriac when it comes to mental health, but it's just because I know I have the predisposition and I know some things can be prevented by having a regular sleeping pattern and I just don't seem to be able to go to bed early anymore. And I like being creative at night, I like this feeling. I just do these regular check ups because somehow I hope that if I am aware of any symptoms coming up I could maybe still influence the development of the disorder. \n\nI am not feeling paranoia, rather I feel like people do want the best for me. I used to be more socially anxious in the past and question peoples intentions more. My father always experienced strong paranoia during his hospitalizations."

As other people in this sub previously stated it was not easy for her to just go to the cops since they would probably bring her back home to her mother. Still I thought of other ways to escape, like contacting a journalist or one of her doctors or something. \n\nGypsy is very clearly not a sociopath, rather she seems kind and idealistic. Whenever she talks, you hear a sweet little girl who has watched disney and or other movies for children almost every day in her life. She did not go to school, she did not have regular contact with friends or anyone at all besides her mother. When we grow up, we compare ourselves with our friends and others to find out 'what is normal' all the time. Humans are social animals and it is something we do in order to survive. \n\nGypsy could not compare herself to others. Clearly she saw herself from being 'different' than normal when she saw her neighbors or teenagers at the mall. But she could not have conversations with others to discuss ethics, do discuss whether something would be appropriate or not. Whenever a famous criminal is exposed people talk about it like 'What would you have done in that situation? Do you think it is wrong that X murdered Y for reason Z and has to go to prison W years?'. I could only imagine her mother would turn off the news if anything appeared that not fitted in the pinky bubbly world she wanted her daughter to keep in. \n\nSo you got Gypsy who has watched her entire life (23 years or something at this point) disney movies. Movies like Rapunzel, Snow White, Cinderella... and ALWAYS the bad person (who is often a relative, like a stepmother) dies in the end. I don't recall a lot of movies in which the bad person just goes to jail or something, they always die either in accidents or they get killed. She MUST have starting thinking of her mother like one of these evil queens and the thought appeared in her mind 'I can only be free when she is dead'. After all, in these movies the princes and princesses who kill the evil caretakers are not portrayed to be bad, they did what was necessary and are therefore good people.\n\nYes there were several other ways to escape the situation... But only if one had actually been in contact with the society. She did not go to school, she did not know how the law system works, she had never heard of Munchausen by proxy, she was never able do discuss the moral aspects and consequences of a crime like murder, what she did do was watching Disney. I wish the girl would have created a reddit account on her secret laptop, to confide in a larger public on what to do instead of only trusting a mentally unstable boy. \n\nWhat she did just made sense in her world. I'm so convinced she must have felt horrible in the bathroom as she heard her mother scream. But she did not feel bad or guilty afterwards, not because she is a sociopath or an evil person, but because it was indeed 'the right thing to do' in the unreal world she lived in. Fiction taught her so. I understand why she went to jail (a psychiatry would have been better tho), we have a law system with rules and one cannot always make exceptions, the system is not made to understand every detail of one persons life and what led to a certain crime, it is made to prevent people from robbing and killing each other. It is very difficult to assess afterwards what she knew about life in the real world, what she knew about crime and murder and the ethical implications and consequences. I would not say that she is a victim of the law, but she just has had sooo much bad luck in her life and it's heartbreaking. I truly wish for her to reunite with her father whenever she's free in a year or so and start a family of her own. I wish for her that she would be able to study something or take classes (even if its' just cooking or gardening or something) so she can learn about life and socialize with others. \n\nIts also hard not to dehumanize Dee Dee, as there is so little known about Munchausen by proxy. I feel like it is kind of a good thing she's dead because there was just no healing for her anymore. If you hurt the person you love the most this much... I don't think there is any sort of 'getting better' because she would never fully understand what she did to Gypsy and if she would understand it would also kill her inside. As there still is so much hope for the future for Gypsy, there seems to be very little for these mothers with MSBP. And I truly hope Nick is followed up by a psychiatrist in jail... How terrible it must be for his parents... \n\nBy the way, I'm sorry if my English is bad, I'm not a native speaker."

In the past I have forced myself to start running and after 10 sessions I started enjoying it. But as I did with food, I also had this yo-yo with running. So whenever I stopped for several months I couldn't get myself to do it again. This went on for like 4 times. It's been over a year again since I ran for the last time. I KNOW I will enjoy it if I persevere, but I just can't seem to start again. It's like the thought of running is emotionally loaded or something. It feels like when you are very hangry and really want some fastfood, but somebody cooked you a vegetable that is not really your favourite but you also 'know' it doesn't taste that bad, you just crave for fastfood. At the moment I really feel guilty when I don't go out jogging whenever I have time, but I really crave for just laying down under a blanket.\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for the advice!!! I just went running right after writing this and it felt really great, better than I expected since I didn't do it in a while. I remember being at the same weight as I am right now a couple of years ago and not being able to run down my street. Even though I am 'as fat' as I was back then, I am able to run 5 times the distance as I could before I even started, so my effort the last years was not for nothing!

I really really really like doing both. I like to analyze and take my time to think stuff through like you do more in internal medicine. But I also like to be busy and it's better for me to be focused on actually doing something with your hands. My internship surgery was even therapeutic. At my university internal medicine is harder to get in. And as a surgeon it's harder to get a job. We only have 1 choice, I can't apply for both. So are there other INFP over here who are specialists in internal medicine or surgery? Can you tell me what makes you good at your job or what your flaws are? What gives you energy? Do you love your job? Thanks!!!"

I feel like I need so many more hours to work on that... But I also don't feel good in my skin, I'm not in good shape at all and I'm not moving enough (I eat healthy right now but still I gained a lot of weight the past years)... I don't see my friends very often and I feel like I am letting them down, I'm always cancelling everything. I also don't have time to do stuff I personally like to do on my own (I'm an introvert and I need this)... BUT I am doing a 60h week internship (for 1.5 years in total, I don't get paid for it)! The lack of time is stressing me out, how am I going to be the person I want to be when all I do is stressing? \n\nShould I focus on my thesis and postpone exercising and hanging out with friends? Or should I try to combine all at once? I just want to be happy and healthy. Chances are high if I postpone the other stuff that a new deadline or exam will come up... And I'll postpone again... I always feel like I'm postponing my entire life... But how am I going to combine everything if I don't have that much time? Should I take the risk of not being able to get this thesis done before the deadline? It can have huge future implications for my career... I'm studying medicine and chances are zero that I would be elected for my preferred specialization if I don't deliver my thesis in time. \n\nAre there people who at some point in their life experienced this problem as well?

I'm a 21yo Mtf (HSTS) transitioner and i've been really happy with the physical results, but I can't say the same for the social results.\n\nI don't suffer any discrimination, I pass considerably well in public. But since I started transitioning my interactions have become sort of fake. I think everyone is treating me like a special snowflake and don't even as a women. They are just treating me as a delusional person and affirming that i'm a women just to be nice, but it doesn't feel right at all. I miss my old interactions, they were honest and natural, and now they are directed to my made up persona and not to me. It's exhausting. I crave for real interactions. Everyone are treating me very carefully because they have fear to be problematic or say something *transphobic*.\n\nI hate the obligation to call myself a women because i'm not. I have all the requeirements to be considered a women by the trans comunity; I look like a women, i think, feel, and express myself as a women, but (it took me a long time to admit this) the only way to be a women is be born and sociallized as such. I'm saying this because growing up as a gay male gave me the oportunity to be closer to females than most of men will be, and I'm sure that their experiences are essential to womenhood, and even if today we experience similar things we are not the same. I just feel irrespectful to define myself in the same category.\n\nI can't medically detransition because my dysphoria is very strong, and I'd hate seeing myself as a man. I also hate the way my body used to feel producing testosterone. I'm from a very conservative context and my whole life i've been gender policed by my family, transitioning gave me the courage to be closer to my true self and confront them. I've also experienced a maturity in all senses since I started HRT.\n\nI don't want to be categorized just as a femenine men, or a femboy, non-binary, gender fluid, etc. I don't want to be categorized at all. I just want to be my life and be respected, but the trans activism has made everything so complicated. I see no liberation for us in the future. I feel confortable be categorized as a HSTS because it describes my materiality but it's not a practical term, and it's also considered problematic by TRA's."

Like why would u be happy to see me stressed? why does being neg make u smile? When i wanted to be a cop these ppl weren\u2019t happy & when i no longer wanted to be a cop they weren\u2019t happy? \n\nMy boss at work is always calling me a panickier. i don\u2019t think i am i rlly don\u2019t see it. It just feels like unnecessary neg comments when u least need them. \n\nThese will be the sm ppl who wont listen to u vent after making u worry Or care to listen when ur excited about something. They ask to know u but not because they care. \n\nSo Why are these ppl always there? and why are there so many in my life rn tht i cant get rid of? \nIf i am a worrier it\u2019ll be because for as long as i can remember i\u2019ve always been surrounded by these ppl."

Most useful: As long as it\u2019s not a grizzly or polar bear, you can clank two rocks together which if loud enough will scare them away.\n\nRule 2. Don\u2019t turn your back \n\nRule 3. Don\u2019t stare them in the eye make sure they know you see them\n\nRule 4. Spread your arms with your rocks to make sure you appear bigger. \n\nRule 5. Another thing to make sure you look out for is incase they have cubs. If you see them without their mom don\u2019t approach thee cute mini Smokey Bears. The mom will track you. If you see a mom with her cubs refer to rule 2 quietly. Don\u2019t make any noise. Get rocks ready incase you do and prepare to clank them together. \n\nRule 6. If they charge throw your rocks at the bear, but if they get two close kneel to the ground with nose in the dirt and hands over your neck. PROTECT VITAL ORGANS. \nRule 6 also applies to grizzly bears.\nIf you see a polar bear seek shelter immediately or else you are dead, don\u2019t ever confront a polar bear.",

Either that, or there would be one of those \u201cotaku\u201d anime girls who think they\u2019re the top of the geniuses by making their own \u201clanguage\u201d, without knowing any conlanging rules, and basically end up changing the letters of the alphabet, and giving them a new sound, resulting in a pig-Latin-esque mock-English instead of an actual conlang. I hate it.\n\nPeople seem to forget how talented and smart people on this sub are. You can tell us apart from the examples I gave by just checking if the they differentiate what we call \u201cconlangs\u201d and a natlang.

Just be careful with your ankles when they're little (they like to chase and grab them) and teach them not to do things you don't like. My cat was pretty easy to train, and he doesn't meow much or cause messes. Try to look in shelters first, though, there are many cats looking for homes. My local shelter only has dogs, so I was forced to look into breeders for a cat. Ragdolls are wonderful companions, just make sure to buy from an ethical and trustworthy breeder!

                "body": "\u201cThere are two types of third-person point of view: omniscient, in which the narrator knows all of the thoughts and feelings of all of the characters in the story, or limited, in which the narrator relates only their own thoughts, feelings, and knowledge about various situations and the other characters\u201d \n\n\u2014first thing that popped up when I searched up limited vs omniscient third person writing\n\nHonestly it\u2019s up to the genre and narrating you\u2019ve chosen. \n\nIf you want a narrator with personality you could address the readers outright in order to provide details readers couldn\u2019t have known otherwise. It seems like this is kinda what you\u2019ve been accidentally doing and if you work with it you can. You\u2019d have it remain consistent with the narrators way of storytelling. I personally am not a fan of this style unless it\u2019s done well, I\u2019m not very good at it myself. (Example: \u201cI must pause this journey now, reader, to highlight the tragedy that now follows Sara\u2019s seemingly desolate wanderings. Despite her cautiousness, she had failed to notice the dark figure that had begun trailing her around the same time she arrived at the abandoned house. I say this not to discredit her own curiosity, but simply explain how such a stalker managed to track her down. It actually occurred when\u2026(insert explanation)) Think of a Lemony Snicket style? It draws attention to your dominant character but also gives the narration importance.\n\nA nonliving narrator, which I prefer, will just rely on what is actually revealed in the story. If it is fantasy/fiction, it is easier to insert flashbacks/telepathy/prophecies/powers etc. throughout the plot to include information that might have been difficult to discover otherwise. Take Harry Potter\u2014written in third person, flashbacks and mind readings often revealed details the main character might not have learned about otherwise because they were from other peoples conversations/lives. The main character is still centered but temporarily steps back enough to highlight his own discovery.\n\nIf not in a normal/logical setting, confessions/recordings/notes/clues/prologues/epilogues can easily include info. Physical evidence leading to a plot twist/key information can be useful without involving other characters directly. This way you can stay in the main characters perspective without having to switch characters or away from third person. This puts the spotlight directly on the main character as they react to what they have just learned.\n\n As for the last bit \u201c2.\u201d I was a little confused but I think you were talking about struggles to switch POVs? If you\u2019re afraid switching characters will kill the intimate vibe, it\u2019s not an issue. With third person view you can provide just as much detail as you explore a different characters activity and contribution to the story. It doesn\u2019t have to be often, maybe only two or three chapters include this character(s) perspective. If it\u2019s first person, don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad if the reading feeling changes. It\u2019s a different character. It\u2019s supposed to feel different. They shouldn\u2019t talk/think the same way the main character does. They have different approaches/opinions/emotions. Make it feel like someone else wrote them\u2014maybe you put bits of your personality in person A, so make sure person B has a total new perspective. Maybe it will feel a little colder and more distant\u2014butnitt still can be personal with a new character with enough detailing and personality. If you\u2019re struggling, that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s your story. Plan it out, put in the effort and detailing.\n\nI was a little tired writing this so I hope it makes sense haha, good luck!",

I've always been more interested to go to a JC compared to a polytechnic because I want to take the Humanites Programme in TJC or even an arts course in a JC and there are no courses in polytechnic that interest me.\n\nMy results have always been quite good (my results are usually english A1, e math A2, POA A1, pure chem A1, pure biology A1, pure geography A1 and ss/history A2), but I have been exempted from mother tongue since Primary 3 and this has helped me to score As or high Bs in my subjects as I don't have to focus on a subject I cannot do.\n\nHowever, I have recently heard to get into a JC, I need to get D7 in mother tongue as H1 mother tongue is compulsory in JC, but I do not even take any other language (I don't take French or German in lieu) and I couldn't find answers for my situation. \n\nI am fearful that I might have to go to a polytechnic and do a course I do not want to do only because I am exempted from Chinese. Hopefully, I can clear my doubts here.\n\nThanks!"

                "body": "Why YSK: two reasons. \n\n\n1. If they did this as a nice gesture or a thank you and the review reaches money hungry management, they may not be so appreciative of the employee's good deed. They could end up in serious trouble, despite gaining a loyal customer or a great review. \n\n\n\n2. If an independent seller includes a free gift or gives a nice discount, others reading reviews may expect the same. This could lead to choosy beggar customers, the seller losing money trying to make everyone happy, or the seller stopping these gifts altogether. \n\n\nThis goes for brick and mortar stores, online shops, restaurants, etc. When I worked in customer service, people were just so awful that even the most basic human decency made me think they were an angel. One time as a server at a chain restaurant, I gave a table a free dessert for being so understanding and patient during a dinner rush. They left a great review that my boss would have loved... had they not mentioned the $11 dessert. Over such a trivial thing that a manager would have even done themselves in that business and happens all the time, I got lectured about how \"if we gave ten dollars to every table we'd be out of business bla bla bla.\" \n\nBe appreciative of the free gift and leave a positive review! You just never know the type of boss they have, so try to avoid them possibly getting in trouble.\n\n\n\nEdit: I am *not* encouraging anyone to give free stuff away. I'm saying if **YOU** encounter an employee that happens to give you a discount or gives you a free drink or whatever it is, the best thing for everyone is to not mention it. \n\nEdit 2: retailers have insurance for stolen merchandise. A minimum wage employee is not hurting a billion dollar company by letting you have a pack of baby wipes or a discount on a pastry. Restaurants include \"freebies\" in their budget. Have you ever been to a restaurant?? This covers birthday desserts, free appetizer for long wait time, spill tab, sendbacks, dead food, etc. The restaurant business expects these type of things, but even though management is quick to comp a kids meal just to shut a table of Karen's up doesn't mean they will be understanding if their server making $2.13 an hour does the same.\n\nEdit 3: im not talking about if someone offers you something free/discounted in *exchange* for a review? Obviously that's different."

                "body": "Hey everyone! I am afab, but have been incredibly confused about my gender for as long as I can remember. I always kind of wished I could be \"one of the boys\" while not actually wanting to be/feeling like a boy. As a child, when we played pretend, I would usually play as a male character (mostly because I prefered male names tbh) until I was old enough to realize that girls were sort of expected to play as girls.\n\nIt's not like I ever really minded being female, but I never liked being *treated* like that or being expected to act a certain way. I used to be that cringy kid that was \"not like other girls\" in primary school, while not even understanding what those \"other girls\" were like. All I knew was that I felt different from what I was expected to feel like.\n\nAs I got older I learned about this community and different gender labels, which explained some things, but also left me which even more questions: I understood that not all afab people identify as feminine and sometimes not even as female. That's when my wild goose chase for a fitting gender lable started. I noticed that I love dressing and being seen as masculine, as well as having people (accidentally) refer to me with he/him pronouns sometimes. However, the only thing I was sure of, was that I'm not a man. And I still don't mind having people call me a woman. It's more that I would prefer if they could switch it up every now and then, if that makes sense? Like, sometimes they can call me a she, other times a he. Or maybe a they. So I looked more into agender, non-binary, genderfluid, etc. identities. They resonated somewhat, though they also didn't quite seem to fit. Whenever someone asked what my gender was, I wouldn't know how to reply because everything felt like a lie. Having people refer to me with... any pronouns, really - and not correcting them with a \"that's actually not what I identify as\", felt like keeping something from them, betraying them and myself somehow. It's silly, because I was okay with being called those pronouns. And it's not like I would have known what I identified as myself either. I just didn't want to pretend like that was my gender.\n\nRecently, I've found the term \"transmasculine\" and it just kind of clicked. I love to present and be perceived as masculine, but not as a man. I like my body and it doesn't make me dysphoric or anything like that at all. Sometimes I consider binding, depending on the day, but in general I'm completely content and even like having a rather feminine body. I would still prefer a male name, masculine/androgynous clothing and maybe a slightly deeper voice, but not in any way that makes me uncomfortable if I don't.\n\nHowever, I've mainly seen \"transmasculine\" be used for trans men and some non-binary people. So in short, my question is: Could it refer to a girl as well? Or would that just make me a tomboy or boyish girl?\n\nThank you to anyone who actually made the effort to read all of this, I know it's a lot!"

It\u2019s expensive, but it\u2019s worth it if you meet the right doctors (those you feel most comfortable around, professional, gives good advices, and you can easily visit when you are struggling with your mental health) and meet them consistently.",

The way he just shook his head and said to Spence, \"there's a whole 'nother side to that woman\" - I always chuckle at that.\n\nAnd, at the end of the day, Derek's reactions are touching. You can tell they have something special. Emily has bonds with everyone, but because she's always partnered up with Derek in action, I guess it hits different and they build a more intense layer of trust in each other. And to think, way back when, in Season 2, she chooses *him* to vent about a bad date she went on and they connect through their shared love for Kurt Vonnegut - *ugh.* Be still, my actual beating heart.\n\nSo throughout the whole of *Lauren,* everybody was worried, obviously, but Derek was the only one who was constantly genuinely bothered by the fact that he didn't know as much about Emily as he thought he did. Which was why the writers picked him >!to be the one with her when she 'died'!<, I think.\n\nIn conclusion, sorry for the rave, I just think Derek Morgan is a great friend, and Emily Prentiss is a crazy cloud of chaos, and I love them both *so* much."

It's great that you realize this because that's the first step to change - and you're only in your first year of college, so there is a lot you can do to make changes that you (and not anyone else) truly desire for yourself. I'm in my final year of undergrad and truly wish I'd been able to find the strength and focus to go after what I really wanted earlier. On hindsight, I could have used two things - 1) self-awareness to realize my own goals (understanding myself, what I want, what truly makes me happy, what I am good at - which requires knowing myself and having the ability to tune out distracting voices of what my friends and those around me think is cool or proper) 2) determination/willpower to follow through with my goals (not compromising on what is important to me in exchange for being liked by friends, being seen as similar, friendship points etc). \n\nI can say with 100% conviction that I wholly regret the times I caved to peer pressure in college, and made a decision that was detrimental to my own health or interests in exchange for doing something with a friend - like taking classes I'm uninterested in just because friends did so, or not taking certain classes because friends said they were 'hard'. When I finally took classes I was inrterested in, the sheer joy and fulfilment I experienced from learning even 'difficult' classes was unparalleled and if I could redo college knowing this, there is no way in hell I would give up the chance to explore my academic interests and passions in exchange for the occasionally fun but ultimately mediocre experience of taking a boring class that I find no meaning in, with the sole consolation of having a friend's company. This is just my two cents, and it might not apply to everyone but it is true for me because I truly enjoy learning and relish studying things I'm interested in (might not be such a priority for others because ultimately we're all wired different) but I hope this helps you in some way. If you need anything, feel free to reach out. All the best!",

Count it as a blessing that you did poorly early on in your uni career because you can improve moving forward (if you score 2.5 in year 2 or 3 it is harder or impossible to climb up). \n\nBut also think you should ask yourself why you did so badly. If you were lazy and can put in more effort, then just work harder. If you tried your best and still got a 2.5 GPA, either you're not very cut out for this course or your studying methods are v inefficient. \n\nIf FCH is very important to you and you can afford it financially, consider taking less mods each sem and spreading out your mods by delaying graduation, or clearing mods with MOOCs and on exchange (free pass fail) to freeze your GPA and allow you to focus on doing well for fewer graded mods.",

(in fact my \"uni experience\" is relatively unremarkable and it's something i won't be missing when i enter the workforce, that i can say with certainty. what i will be missing if i don't extend a sem, might be the opportunity to take modules i am keen on but never did) \n\nDelaying joining the workforce is a small consideration. I am mainly motivated by wanting to take courses I did not get a chance to take, due to making poor choices of taking courses I'm uninterested in through uni. \n\nHonestly masters is a whole other ball game so I don't see how I will ever get the opportunity to take the courses i wish to take, in the exact way I wish to take them (under a structured uni system), except for extending a sem. (unless there is an option to take the exact classes I want to take, under NTU or some other local uni, and get graded and acknowledged on a transcript that I did take them, while I am concurently in the workforce working a full time job - I don't think there's such an option)",

I'll eventually enter the workforce, so I don't see the point in doing it as soon as possible just to keep up with my peers. \n\nI used to think taking a gap year was a waste of time but I know of people in my batch who took gap years and are 2-3 years older than the rest. The result? They are certain of what they're studying and are happy and motivated. Compare that with people who rushed into choosing a degree and ended up not really liking what they're studying (what I did). So I think taking more time is worthwhile if it is used productively and goal-oriented, to gaining a better understanding of what you want. In my personal experience rushing for the sake of keeping up doesn't work out. Maybe you have a different experience, so kudos to you.\n\nSo personally for me no amount of companionship and being able to relate to my friends is a worthwhile trade off in exhange for pursuing what I want to do. I have made decisions with the consideration of being around friends so I can have companionship, but those decisions led me to doing things I didn't want to do which on hindsight were a waste of time.

I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don\u2019t smoke, but I   \noccasionally drink. I\u2019m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.\n\nI was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I\u2019m trying to explain that I\u2019m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn\u2019t lose to anyone.",

If you are to believe that he can see the future of the human race and how it will turn out, in the larger scale of things it could be the right thing to do. For example, if you know that a certain man would later in life commit genocide to innocent people, murder might be wrong but in a bigger picture that man's death would be the salvation of countless of lives. We already have a fair share of ruthless psychopaths these days.  Who knows what would've happened had those pre-flood people survived to this day, those people who are hopelessly accustomed to immorality. Christians believe that what may be the reason for the Flood, it is for the own good of humanity. Sorry for the delayed reply I'm not much active with reddit these days.",

(hehe) youre so beautiful, you blind me to everything. i feel as if i cant look at you, without a smile forcing its way onto my face. you are physically beautiful, yes, even if you couldn\u2019t believe it\u2014but your beauty is in your voice, your jokes, your love, your passion, your thoughts, and every little experience that has shaped you. the ones i have witnessed and the ones i have not. we grew together, and i loved you for every moment. it took me so long to realize, because its so unbelievable, how i could love anyone as desperately as i love you. five years of you, but i wish i had all of them. i want to do everything with you, not anything fancy, not any dates, but i want to experience everything with you, because you would make the most mundane of things better. the most beautiful parts of life would be ashamed in your presence. to somebody else, i may sound like im just lovesick, that maybe im in over my head, but this is just a diagnosis for the tightness in my chest. even if its not with me, i just want you to feel a love this beautiful, that puts a smile on your face and a tightness in your chest even through the rough patches. i dont regret loving you, and i love you the most."

[This post and my comment in it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/w0mg50/the_aegis_twoface_test/)(XC2 spoilers). In the same space I took to write about a single aspect of Pyra(and not even all of it) I could comfortably fit all the salient aspects of the main cast of 3, Ouroboros forms aside.\n2. The idle(continuous), run and walk animations. Above all else, differentiate these animations and make them look rad. But no, the different animations go to secondary things like moving in water or the camp animations or the timed idle animation rather than the ones you see for 90% of your game. If you aren't versed in animation, imagine the 4-5 end-of-fight dialogues and imagine they weren't even memable.\n3. Even the swimsuits, tailor-made per characters, didn't even bother keeping their main color consistent with the base, Eunie in particular switched to a completely unrelated palette, not to mention there's three separate swimsuits with blue as the primary color. At best, this conflicts with the color coding they had, at worst this implies they never gave a shit to begin with\n\nThese and more things culminate in these characters exhibiting only a fraction of the, well, character that 2's did\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if I went too deep there. I tried to be as laconic as possible, but when talking about this stuff it's hard to gauge how much knowledge you can give for granted",

The development of motifs was important just as a way to make different figures identifiable across different art styles, especially for a figure like St Sebastian who was so popular in art. \n\nA lot of it was just the unintentional combination of the phallic and the erotic. You have the known, important aspects of St Sebastian's story--the arrows, a phallic symbolic, the wooden post/tree he was shot against, also a phallic symbol. You have St Sebastian as sort of a proxy for Jesus during the crucifixion--the church had, expectedly, pretty strict control of how the crucifixion could be depicted, but St Sebastian was another young man pinned up against an erect piece of wood and pierced in the side who you could depict more freely. You have the phallic imagery of the crucifixion (the cross, the nails) that gets carried over to Sebastian. \n\nAnd then you have the erotic. I don't remember off the top of my head if being stripped of his clothes was part of St Sebastian's experience or if  being depicted as mostly naked was, again, a result of the proximity to crucifixion imagery (Jesus was naked on the cross) but either way, depicting him as near naked was a standard and the erotic implications of a young naked man are obvious. Then you have that Jesus was described as experiencing ecstasy before his death on the cross, but again, the way you could depict this for Jesus was very limited, so instead artistic exploration of Jesus' ecstasy happened through St Sebastian. Combine the expression of ecstasy with the lack of gore--to the extent that there's blood in these scenes, it's a delicate, tantalizing dribble, an ooze, a leak--and it really stops looking like a horrific and torturous death and instead like a pretty romantic experience. You have the notion of being pierced--the wound in Jesus' side has long had sort of yonic connotations (which again, means same connotations for Sebastian), and so when you combine the yonic wound, glistening and leaking, being penetrated by the phallic sword or arrow, you get erotic imagery. \n\nSo when you have a young, attractive, naked man tied up to a phallic symbol being erotically penetrated by other phallic symbols and displaying an expression of ecstasy...\n\nAnd then there's the connection to Apollo (and therefore gay love) both through shared archery imagery for Sebastian and Apollo and shared sun imagery for Jesus and Apollo. But I will wait until I'm linking you to sources for that because I feel much less confident expounding on it myself.",

                "body": "To insist that Sts Perpetua and Felicity are gay because they're held in significance by LGBT Christians and because they died together is to 1. ignore the majority of their story, as written by Perpetua herself, and more importantly 2. mischaracterize both the entire concept of saints and patronage, and how LGBT people have fit ourselves into that system.\n\nAn easy example is St Sebastian. St Sebastian is *the* gay saint. Over Sts Sergius and Bacchus, over Sts Polyeuchtus and Nearchus, over St Cornelius, over St John Apostle, over many other important saints--including biblical figures--with elements of their stories implying same gender attraction and relationships. There is nothing gay about St Sebastian's life. There is no reason to think St Sebastian was gay. And yet St Sebastian has been associated with gay men, has been the unofficial patron saint of gay men, has been a symbol gay men have used for themselves and an allusion to their orientation for literally centuries. Because in art, St Sebastian is generally portrayed as lithe or athletic, with longer, curly, sometimes blond hair, and light skin, similar to figures like Apollo, Achilles, Narcissus, Endymion--mythological figures associated with gay love. Because St Sebastian is generally portrayed mostly naked, gazing up with an expression of sublime ecstasy, his body pierced by arrows (but without gore.) St Sebastian is the gay saint not because St Sebastian was gay, but because he was depicted in a homerotic way in medieval art (as to why, that's a whole discussion itself) and his depiction resonated with many gay men. What may have been, for example, an allusion to Apollo because of the shared association with archery became, to gay men, an association with gay love. \n\nSt Sebastian is considered the patron of archers because he was *martyred* by *archers.* He was *killed* by archers, and then a bunch of archers said \"hey I bet that guy would put in a good word for us\" and started looking to him for intercession (and found it.) Sts Perpetua and Felicity are associated with cattle and cattle farmers because during their passions they were nearly killed by a cow. Many saints are patrons of causes that have *nothing* to do with their lives or deaths simply because those are causes which, for some reason, they have chosen to intercede in. *Especially* in very very old and long-venerated saints like Sts Perpetua and Felicity, the relationship between their lived experiences and their causes is often unintuitive at best.\n\nLike gay men have seen St Sebastian's depiction and identified themselves in it, many  gay women have seen depictions of Sts Perpetua and Felicity and identified themselves in it. They have seen two women, holding each other, cheek to cheek. The vivid account of St Perpetua has been read--as part of Mass even--and held in high regard across the Christian world for basically as long as there has been a Christian world. And the account of two women finding comfort in each other holds special significance to gay women just like the depiction of St Sebastian holds special significance to gay men.\n\nBut genuinely there is nothing about the relationship between Sts Perpetua and Felicity that implies a romantic element, or an undue/unexpected level of closeness considering their experiences. I'm not saying they weren't gay. Very well they may have been. But I take issue with the idea that there's this wealth of evidence that they were and it's just being ignored, and I specifically take issue with the idea of saints being associated with a group somehow acting as evidence that they belonged to that group in their earthly lives.\n\n\nAlso, just as two extra little asides: 1. there's not debating whether saints went to heaven and hell. I mean, there is, but that's called canonization. Saints are people we *know* are in heaven. And 2. being in heaven doesn't prove someone isn't gay, even if you believe being gay is a sin, especially when that person is a martyr.",

But if you go from running 10+ miles a day to running 0, even if all other activity stays the same or even slightly increases you're losing out on 1000+ calories that you're used to eating. It's not cutting back on salad dressing or whatever, it's cutting out of your diet as much as some people eat in the entirety of theirs. There's a massive mental aspect to that--not to mention that, idk if you've ever been specifically a distance runner and had to stop running suddenly, but your appetite does not scale back immediately. \n\nAnd why should he be dedicating so much mental energy to fighting his appetite and completely overhauling his diet while he's healing? Why risk cutting back to much and not having the appropriate nutrition for the most efficient, quick recovery? Even with a team of doctors and nutritionists, it's still a bit of adjustment and exploration/trial and error he doesn't need to go through. Why not keep consistent, so he doesn't have to be constantly readjusting as he gets to slowly work back up to his previous activity, keep stress levels down so he can focus on healing, and just accept that he'll gain a few pounds--that, you know, he will then lose again once he's active?",

He was recently lamenting to me that he didn't have any good pictures of her, so I was going through and sending him the best ones that I have, and I realized I have a recording of her purring. I want to incorporate the recording into a gift for him in some way.\n\nI've heard of people putting recordings in a stuffed animal or pillow to be hugged, but that doesn't really seem like the best option of something to give a 70 year old man. What other sort of gifty items can I incorporate it into?\n\nMy dad is an outdoorsy (gardening, camping, hiking, fishing) guy. He's a sports fan, and she used to sit with him and watch every game. He also had a ritual with her of sitting outside together while he drank his morning coffee. He wears jewelry for occasions but only a fitbit on the day-to-day.\n\nAny ideas are appreciated!"

And despite Judaism having what seems to be to be more rules, I can't remember ever really hearing about what happens when they're broken.\n\n1.a. Say someone is normally very strictly observant, but just once for whatever reason decided to break a commandment. They drive to the park on a Saturday because the weather is just so nice, even though they normally don't. Or they get a little drunk and end up getting a matching tattoo with a friend, even though they'd normally be opposed to getting a tattoo. What's the next step? The consequence? The process?\n\n1.b. Or related I guess. But if someone is otherwise very strictly observant but has their one thing that they just decided not to follow. Like very strictly Sabbath observant, except they'll use a pencil to write down things they might forget.  Or keeps kosher, except they don't wait long enough between meat and dairy. So what?\n\n\n2. In the Passover story it says that Israelites who eat leaven \"shall be cut off from the community of Israel\" (Exodus 12:19). And as I understand from the concept of kitniyot, it counts even if it's on accident. So does that mean if you accidentally eat leaven during passover you're not Jewish anymore? Is that forever?\n\n3. I'm assuming Yom Kippur fits into it somehow. But how, if it's only once a year?"

The ending could serve as a total finale where Michael and George Michael actually leave, or be the starting point of more shenanigans in a potential Season 6.\n\nI'm okay with that because AD never really had resolutions. At the end of Season 3 when they thought the show was done forever, basically nothing is resolved. I don't think any of the characters really deserve a resolution.\n\nThroughout the show Michael and George Michael constantly have conversations that accomplish nothing. Anytime they talk, they act like they want the best for each other, but one of them immediately starts backtracking for selfish reasons. At the beginning of the show it's mostly Michael, but George Michael really grows into that. By Season 4, he's doing it just as much as Michael.\n\nPlus, we've seen the Michael goodbye a bunch of times.",

It just has so much more than the movies offered. Also, auidobooks are helpful because you don\u2019t have to actually *read* it if you don\u2019t want to (I recommend the Libby app \u2014 you have to sign up for your local library\u2019s E-Card for it to work, but then you\u2019ll have access to free audiobooks). \n\n\n\nThey mention it in the first book \u2014 Tris gets closer to Four and ends up asking if he\u2019s divergent. I don\u2019t even think he answers her question directly, but I believe (can\u2019t remember exactly) his faction test was inconclusive as well. But even before that, it\u2019s mentioned through dialogue and certain scenes that Four is different basically. Tris can tell that Four doesn\u2019t seem like the rest of the dauntless, and mixed with the fact that he was able to resist the mind control serum (the first time it\u2019s used) \u2014 it just all builds up to the conclusion that he IS divergent. This is where it\u2019s first explored/mentioned. \n\nIn the 3rd book, government testing shows he\u2019s not FULL divergent (only somewhat divergent instead). And because of that, it doesn\u2019t allow him to have the same exact serum experiences as Tris. Phrasing it differently: he\u2019s got some limitations because of his lower percentage of divergence.",

                "body": "From my own experience, I\u2019d like to say a couple things if you don\u2019t mind... \n\n\n\n1. My roommate is going through a somewhat similar experience as you. They got a BA in a liberal arts degree. Basically they didn\u2019t know what they wanted to do after college and got something kind of generic. They had worked a few different jobs after graduating and I think only one of them was satisfactory. However, the pay pretty much sucked. They would 100% be working for a hotel front desk if it payed a shit ton more, but since it doesn\u2019t, they\u2019re at a call center now - where it pays well but absolutely hates their job now. \n\n\n\nThey now are applying everyday to a different company (with better or equal pay from current job) in hopes to try something different. They have been applying to marketing companies, receptionist roles, customer service, and administration roles (places like law firms, hospitals, schools, etc). So you may have to expand your mind to the possibilities of what could work for you.\n\n\n\n2. My dad hires people at his company on the maintenance side of stuff, and he\u2019s always given me the advice that you should always apply to places, even if you don\u2019t always fit the \u201crequirements\u201d because sometimes they\u2019re not hard-lined requirements, and are, instead, just preferences of that company. However, if it\u2019s a city/state/federal job, that\u2019s not the case. You pretty much have to reach that requirement for those lol. Otherwise, it\u2019s fair game. And I\u2019d say that you might be surprised who gives you a chance, even though you don\u2019t have years of experience, etc. \n\n\n\nIf they ask you in an interview why you applied even though you don\u2019t have experience - that\u2019s when you tell them you\u2019d like the chance to learn that experience with their company.\n\n\n\n3. I am also applying to jobs, trying to build a career, and I feel like we\u2019re all lost in some way or another, so just remember that you\u2019re not alone and I believe we\u2019ll all find our paths eventually. Don\u2019t worry so much! Just take one day at a time. Apply to 1 place a day, and I bet you\u2019ll find something. If you put too much pressure into applying to 10 places in 1 day, you\u2019re gonna burn yourself out. You\u2019re not going to keep the momentum. \n\n\n\n4. ALSO the most solid answer, perhaps, is that you could try googling, \u201ccorporate offices in [your city],\u201d and then apply to administrative, HR, etc. for each of those companies.",

It was a PC video game (very possible it was some browser game, but it seemed pretty immersive) that was geared toward kids or teens and had a spooky theme. I remember there being noises like footsteps and owl sounds to get to next puzzle. It was possibly a maze to get to a castle... and there were definitely potions involved and of different colors?  I also remember it was in a creepy forest and nighttime. It was in 1st person, but you don't control movement; you'd only progress to next level/puzzle by solving a puzzle... pretty 2-D looking and very ambient sounds if i recall correctly. "

Nowadays almost 90% guys won\u2019t try to approach women anymore because the feminists ruined it for other women and men alike.

Most guys haven\u2019t done much to improve their charisma, income or lifestyle either so they settle down too fast and act like they deserve any girl with no effort which is bizarre. \n\nAnother thing is ROI (return on investment) if the guy approaches a girl most guys understand that women are very flaky anyway so they don\u2019t see much upside. Many Guys can be too logical and over analyze a simple interaction for no reason. Lastly, many men are just flat out lame with no game so nobody initiates anything anymore.

Fear won\u2019t leave so I must absorb it, feel it, observe it, make peace with it and move on - but now I MUST march ahead despite being afraid with my flag held high in the air, my mission in my heart and what I stand for. I\u2019m marching forward anyway because my desire is BIGGER than my fear. My mission is more IMPORTANT than my fear. My LOVE for my family, my friends, my team, my community is LOUDER than any fear! \u201cFEEL the fear, acknowledge it\u2019s presence and consciously decide yes.. I AM afraid but I\u2019m still gonna take action anyway.

My MIL, who I love, is a professional seamstress, and at some point I asked her to teach me sewing, maybe 10 years ago? It was a disaster. Her thinking/technique was too advanced for me, she would get frustrated and talk down to me because some things I did were not \u201cprofessional\u201d, and I couldn\u2019t do any sewing on my own because she altered patterns and guided me through every step, so I didn\u2019t follow the pattern instructions. I quit for many years. Last year, I just got my sewing machine/serger out of storage, watched a bunch of YouTube videos, and started figuring things out on my own.  Sure, I don\u2019t get professional advise/help, I screw up a lot, but now it\u2019s actually a fun hobby! And I got a few office dresses out of it that I am actually proud of (moving on to pants soon)\n\nP.S. would love to see a pic of your shirt when it\u2019s done :)",

If your husband thinks that staying home all weekend, and a scheduled swimming class is too much (which he doesn\u2019t even have to attend), he is delusional. He is a parent now, and he needs to start acting like one. I have a 5yo, and he would be climbing walls after two days inside (tested during lockdowns). \n\nThen let\u2019s move on to the weekdays. If weekends are for \u201crelaxing\u201d and a nanny is handling pick-ups, drop-offs, the fun playground time, when are you getting a chance to build special childhood memories with your kid? You re-arranged your working schedule to spend more time with your daughter because it matters to you, if your husband is jealous that you \u201chave it all\u201d then he can do the same. You don\u2019t need to do less for him to feel better about himself.\n\nAnd, another question to ask yourself, how do you think your husband would want to spend all that extra quality family time, if you do work part time or get a nanny? Does he want to spend more time reading books as a family, going on dates, cuddle while watching a movie? Or do you see yourself doing more cleaning, cooking, and taking over his chores in general? Just a thought.",

                "body": "When my husband (36M) and I (33F) were talking about starting a family and parenting, he always said that he wanted to tell kids the \u201ctruth\u201d at all times. His parents are good people, but he has complained about their parenting style a lot. I am far from being a perfect parent to judge. They had a hard life,  unfortunately, and they did their best to keep \u201cmagic alive\u201d for their kids, from what I gather, and kept up stories about mythical characters, like Santa. Not a ridiculous move on their part, in my opinion. When we were expecting our first child, my husband kept stressing that there will be no Santa or Easter Bunny delusions with our kids, and I have no problem with that. So far we have managed to have wonderful time with family & friends during the holidays while respecting my husband\u2019s boundaries. Our kids are 6M and 2F.\n\nI thought the \u201ctruth telling\u201d will end at Santa, but no. My husband had several conversations with 6M that made me uncomfortable (I wasn\u2019t there for the conversations, but I did get a lot of follow up questions). Now my son is asking me (every 2-3days) if I am going to die. Reason - he drove by a cemetery a couple of weeks ago with his dad, and his dad explained how everyone is going to die eventually, including me. My son is upset and keeps bringing it up. \nSecond - my sister is pregnant, and to explain that his dad had a \u201cseed and egg\u201d conversation, so now my son is under the impression that if he gives me a seed I can give him another baby (he loves his sister and wants another sibling). I told him this is not how things work and now praying he will not pull that line in school in September\nThird - I went gift shopping for my son\u2019s friends\u2019 birthday, and ended up getting my son a toy too ($8 or so). My husband didn\u2019t \u201cdisapprove\u201d but he did go on to telling our 6M about plastic and climate change.  Fair point, but we rarely get new toys for our kids because of his believes, and I don\u2019t want them to feel bad about it.\n\nOverall, I think it\u2019s too much\u201dtruth\u201d for a 6yo to handle. Am I right to be concerned about my husband\u2019s stance on \u201ctruth telling\u201d?"

Now to the recipe...\n\nI cooked about 1.5c of dry chickpeas (that yielded maybe 4 cups when cooked). Blend them (roughly) with 2 eggs and a bunch of spices (I used garlic powder, salt, pepper and paprika). Mix in chopped green onions (regular cooked onion would work too, but I have a bunch of green onions growing in my backyard at the moment), and 0.5c of bread crumbs. Form patties, and fry (for softer) or bake for 20min 400F (for drier consistency). Enjoy! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0b"

I did my undergrad in art and business there (an interdisciplinary degree), and the art department is very top notch. There is a lecture series every semester with visiting contemporary artists - it should be open for anybody in CMU. The art department is very cliquey, but if you get involved in things like The Studio for Creative Inquiry, you could easily mingle with students interested in tech x art. I would say that without a bachelors (sometimes even a masters) or at least some experience working in the arts, it is realistically very hard to transition from chemical engineering to art jobs, unless you are solely focused on your art practice. Even so, practicing artists tend to juggle a job on the side because the art market is very saturated and paying your rent with your art is probably unrealistic, unless you have rich patrons supporting your work. \n\nArt is a beautiful medium that can enrich our souls and propel us to investigate and understand our world better. My two cents if you\u2019re looking to be a practicing artist or work in the arts, it must be more than a hobby - it has to be an intense love bordering on obsession.",

I can speak from the perspective of an Asian American that I had never seen a movie or show with an Asian character that didn't include heavy accents, kung fu, or IT/doctor roles until 2018, which you could imagine can really impact one's self-image growing up. Although I am not black, I can only imagine the kinds of stereotypes black communities face, which can lead to dangerous repercussions. And so even if I don't fully understand Rachel's anger as a non-black person, I will earnestly listen and learn from her experience. Yes, BN is just a reality show, but also, I don't think social reform is only the responsibility of politicians, but rather the entire community. I have no idea if this footage of Matt with his dad was aired with Matt's full consent, but regardless, I think a great solution for BN moving forward is to take serious input from prev BIPOC contestants and work together to figure out what inclusion looks like in the fullest sense. At the end of the day, I just want to see love stories that represent all colors of the US!",

I have two years of digital marketing experience in a festival and program focused arts non-profit and am doing a school teaching artist Americorps year from July-June 2021. I can see my career going several directions and I'm looking for one that would be most fulfilling, a personality match, and preferably stable. Based on my Gallup StrengthsFinder results and MBTI (INFJ), I thrive in a career that is intellectually driven, creative, mission driven, and in a role where I can make executive decisions and solve human problems. I'm also open to getting a relevant masters depending on which path I go towards. I've narrowed my career choices into 4 options:\n\n1. **Non-profit manager**, specifically responsible for running public art commissions, arts festivals, and/or education programs. I'm open to the programmatic, community development, or education side of work. However, the job market in the arts is very small and I'm worried that Corona has dissolved many of the existing jobs. To give an example, Philly's mayor is planning on entirely eliminating the Office of Arts, Culture & Creative Economy. In summary, would be a very fulfilling dream job, but is competitive and likely losing funding/closing bc of corona. \n\n2. **Multimedia journalist or Producer/Editor** in a documentary-focused media organization. I don't have much professional experience in this at all, but I do have photography, writing, and basic video experience from my former digital marketing job, as well as an investigative project in college that won a small research award. I would very much need to go to grad school or begin a certificate program to gain more industry skills.\n\n3. **Art Teacher/Education Admin**? I like being a mentor to kids and helping them intellectually grow. Will be spending a year teaching art in July to build my skills in youth development, which can help with a non-profit or education career. I'm an extroverted introvert by nature though, so I'm not sure if a career of teaching will be too socially taxing. \n\n4. My absolute last backup would be **Marketing**. I have two years of digital marketing experience along with some relevant internship/school experience and although I enjoy content creation, I feel very unhappy with other essential elements of the job (social media management, ad management, revenue tracking). Also, not as much human interaction in the job as I would like.\n\nTLDR; Looking to map out a career that is an ideal fit, stable, and utilises my skills. Having trouble committing to one and would like some opinions!"

That kind of spooked me even though he was great in every way (kind, hardworking, family-oriented).\n\nI'm a fan of dating people outside of my culture, upbringing, and range of interests because I'd love to learn from my partner just as much as he can learn from me. Theoretically, I hope to give a chance to someone who sees politics a little differently too. However, is this really compatible in the long term?

Problem is I'm not a fan of the interiors, especially with the wireless version.\n\nI've tried all Zowie mice, and VAXEE but they're not to my taste.\n\nAny suggestions?"

I don't play Apex, Quake or fast paced shooters. Only tactical. I want the stopping power of celestials so I can stop overflicking like a pleb.\n\nTried QcK Heavy, G-SR SE, PA, Hayate Otsu, all these are in my opinion too fast for me.\n\nThe best pad I've used has been a battle scarred G-SR SE, holy shit this makes me a pro compared to any meta pad today. But this godlike effect is only applied on certain muddy spots which of course isn't reliable since I need that feel for the entire pad of course.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments! I ended up going with the gamesense radar! Apparently the second best option after the GSR according to spreadsheet down in the replies so I'm pretty excited about it. If it's not up to taste then GSR black it is.\n\nUpdate: https://youtu.be/NRItzRRq-8s"

Mirabel didn't even have her own room and was treated like dogshit (which is a big mood). Sure you could argue that Isabella had to keep up her reputation but she also *didn't have to.* It just wasn't a reason to treat her sister badly.\n\nAnd in defense of Mirabel, I get that people are saying she should've looked at the perspective of her golden sister. The thing is she isn't actually obligated to; Isabela had the choice not to put on a facade. Yes, yes I can understand that if she didn't she'd be the next scapegoat but you'd think that would help her to actually empathize with Mirabel. Mirabel literally lives through being that scapegoat everyday.\n\nMirabel calls her entitled because she could never understand what it's like to be the scapegoat when you have done nothing wrong, and I can totally get behind that. Isabela will never understand the kind of dogshit Mirabel went through and she just simply chooses not to, because 'pressure to maintain her image.' Does it make it right? No. What she *should* have done was defend her sister.\n\nI'm a middle child and my older brother is also a scapegoat even though he's trying to live up to my father's expectations. I defend him because he's trying to stand up for himself rather than try keep up this image of 'giftedness,' which is the right thing to do. He and I understand what it's like to be scapegoats and we've simply come across not caring about living up to expectations at all but rather just trying to live our lives.

                "body": "So I'm dating a guy who took an mbti test and came out ENFJ, though it shouldn't be surprising that personality tests aren't exactly accurate most of the time and they just serve as a starter guide.  \n\n\nSee this guy is pretty goofy, but he also doesn't really do much. He constantly tells me he's bored but when I ask him if we can do anything he'll say he's too lazy (which is why I'm always the one who plans the activities). He doesn't have any trouble speaking with people although he gets pretty nervous or awkward around me since he likes me, after all.  \n\n\nHis hobbies are: playing videogames (stuff like Pokemon and Terraria). He's pansexual (if this helps anyway) and he's twenty one years old. He works as a military soldier in Vietnam though he's half-American and has a house in Vegas. He's very good at sports, dude's basically a gym freak (he jogs at 4AM, goes to the gym at 3PM, and plays soccer with friends at around 5PM). I'm not sure if he's curious, but he won't ask any more if he notices it makes me uncomfortable. Sometimes he spends his time watching other people make drama for some reason because he thinks it's funny. He seems to be able to lead people especially in sports. He makes really cute soft pastel art, though he doesn't show it to anyone else and keeps it to himself. Sometimes he'll tell me stuff about himself, but he rarely does it to anyone. He'll help when he can, but if he's busy he'll turn down favors. He's pretty impulsive when it comes to making decisions that will result in regret for the consequences (for example: destroying his PC that he couldn't fix).  \n\n\nThe biggest issue with why I question if he's an Fe-dom at all is because of how hostile he is with other people. He would, out of nowhere, insult someone who didn't even bother him to begin with. When I confront him of this behaviour he'll tell me I'm an exception with stuff like \"Not you\" or \"You're different.\" When I get mad at him he'll avoid me like the plague, and will try to appease me while simultaneously limiting himself from the conflict (stuff like \"ahh I'm too busy\" or reacting with a lot of sad emojis to what I text while trying his best to shift topics). Whenever his feelings get seriously hurt from someone else, he'll retaliate and won't talk for a while even if I come to comfort him. He'll open up to me later on why he acted the way he did.  \n\n\nOriginally I thought maybe he's an unhealthy Fe-dom given that he seems to be acting out of his emotions only for the same Fe to make him apologise once the anger subsides. But now I'm starting to think he might be Fi-Te instead, with his Fi being impulsive and his Te barking it out. I've ruled out the possibility that he's a Thinking type simply because he constantly gets his feelings hurt (which causes him to act hostile all the time). Though he is very rude and impulsive, he somehow has a set of moral codes that he even follows in his ambitions (his parents died when he was young, so as mentioned earlier he proceeded to be a military soldier to 'protect other families from having the same fate').   \n\n\nI'm pretty stumped, can anyone help? I'm guessing maybe he's ESFP?"

I told him I had it because it's a side effect in taking those iron supplements he gave me; I'm 99% sure those pills are the culprit because this sort of thing happened months ago too when I first took the pills.\n\nI spent the whole day crying today and I'm guessing my parents will scold me again for having swollen eyes. I really wish I hadn't told them anything. I'd honestly rather go to the doctor myself if they allowed me or if I had the money to. At this point I don't even care, I feel like I'd rather internally bleed than have to deal with their bullshit again. Every time my NDad yells at me it's like I relive the same thing over and over again. It's like I'm still a little kid who can't do shit. I never tell them anything because they deflect it against me instead of actually helping me. They yell at me for not knowing how to do things when they've never taught me how. I get yelled at for things I don't even have any control of, like this particular rectal bleeding I have. When I first had my period my mom yelled at me for getting some on my underwear even though I didn't even know and only found out after we woke up. My dad beat me up for staying up late working on a school project, but I bet if I turned in a bad grade he'd still beat me up. As a kid they yelled at me to stop crying otherwise I'd get the belt.\n\nSometimes I wish there'd be someone out there who would help me escape from this hellhole and tell me I'm not crazy or wrong, but I know everyone has their own problems that might even be worse. That's okay I guess. I get that I'm the only one who should be saving myself.\n\nReading this sub kind of helped to realize that I'm not alone in this and other kids have it too. They went through narcissistic abuse but their feelings of trauma and grief for it are valid. It's kind of hard to give myself the same treatment somehow and I don't know why, but at least knowing the kinds of things going on here aren't normal... it's safe to say I'm valid. \n\nI just want to thank this subreddit and the people who reply and get together to help those who have dealt with abuse, even if we're random strangers in the internet.\n\nUpdate: my dad didn't take me to a doctor. He simply told me to get a cup of my feces for stool examination. This morning I released a lot of blood right after I woke up that it almost looked like I had a period... but in my ass. I got very dizzy since I hadn't consumed any water while rushing to the bathroom. As we speak I can somehow sit now with only milder discomfort compared to before.\n\nUpdate #2: I just received the results of the stool examination. I have amoeba. I'm guessing the meds will be fetched soon.\n\nUpdate #3: NDad fetched me medicine. I'm still somewhat bleeding but no longer having bloody diarrhea at least. It also doesn't hurt like it did before."

You'll realize \"this isnt that bad I can do a few more\" and do most or all of your dishes \nOr\n2. You only do one dish and thats okay! Because that's one dish out of the way for later!\n\nI find that getting up to do them in the first place is the hardest part but one dish is way easier than the whole sink so I dont dread the idea as much so I get up to do it and once I'm up I always end up just doing them all!\n\nEdit: based on some replies im worried this came off as toxic positivity or something and i totally did not mean it that way. Obviously this will not work every time and some days you just don't have the energy to get up even for one dish but this still helps me get dishes done more often than I used to and I hope it can help other people too even if it only helps a little bit!"

It would have aired on a major tv channel (ABC, CBS, NBC, or Fox) in the USA sometime between the mid to late 2000\u2019s (definitely after 2004) where young couples in either their late teens or early 20\u2019s would go an try to be a family with kids from different age groups every episode. Like one week was babies, then toddlers, tweens, teens, etc. I remember one couple broke up mid show so production played it off as a divorce and had the girl be a single parent for the remainder of the season while the guy just ditched. I know it was on during a week night either at or after 8 pm eastern for about an hour and I think it only had one season. I wanna say it was on CBS cause I think Kid Nation was airing around the same time but on a different night. Thank you to anyone who knows what it\u2019s called or where I could watch it again!"

                "body": "Okay so this one has been eating away at me for a while. Are the male sonichus and female rosechus the same species? Or are they technically different? Like, in the origin story Super Sonic hits a male Pikachu creating Sonichu and a rainbow that hits a female Raichu creating Rosechu, and that I understand. Where I\u2019m getting confused is everything after.\n\nMost of this confusion comes from Chris themself. Chris has stated numerous times that Rosechu is female. They also say that Rosechu is one of the \u201cElectric Hedgehog Pokemon\u201d just like Sonichu. But if the whole Sonichu dick diagram is to be believed \u201call Sonichus have penises\u201d. So are all Rosechus Sonichus? Meaning they all have had dicks all along? Or is Sonichu not the final form of its evolutionary line? Like if a Sonichu touches a thunder stone like Pikachu will it evolve into a Rosechu and have its dick fall off? This however would imply that all Sonichus are not as strong as they can be as Raichu is naturally stronger than Pikcachu because it is an evolved Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nThrowing the Sonees and Roseys into the mix just makes things even more complex. Like are they Pichus or are they literally just baby male Pikachus and female Raichus respectively? To make this even more messy Chris makes Robee a tomgirl. Would Robee be a male with feminine tendencies forever or if Chris continued to write the comics would Robee seek out a way to transition?\n\nThe way I see it Sonichus/Rosechu are either like Nidoking/Nidoqueen in that they come from the same evolutionary family but are technically different species when it comes to classifying them (i.e the pokedex or any other scientific identifying system). If this is the case then problem solved as both Nidoking/Nidoqueen are both the Drill Pokemon. However the case seems to be that all Rosechus are based off of female Raichus exclusively while all Sonichus are basically male Pikachus. Both Pikachu and Raichu are both known as the Mouse Pok\u00e9mon though just like Sonichu and Rosechu are both Electric Hedgehog Pokemon. To me it kind of seems like Chris cherry picked aspects from both of these lines of thought while simultaneously not putting much thought into it at all.\n\nPersonally I think that if Sonichu touches a thunder stone he undergoes a sex change but I dunno, maybe someone who knows the comic lore better could clear that up for me."

The ONLY time i feel like i want to touch someone or be touched is when i have that emotional bond. i don't have the desire to masturbate unless im emotionally bonded to someone and the act of masturbation therefore becomes a way for me to be connected to them on my own, but i don't feel a burning desire in my body to even do so.  \n\n\nmy self esteem is completely crushed. i feel abnormal, weird, alone, like i lack some sort of essential aspect of being human, and i wonder if something is wrong with my brain.   \n\n\ni know that being demisexual does not equate to having a lower libido, as many demi's have high or normal libidos. but i feel quite alone in being this way and was wondering if anyone else is like this? its hard enough being demisexual, but having no libido makes life very difficult and isolating. im open to hearing others experiences or how they relate to this. thank you:)"

Also, the circle of life, animals have been eating animals for a long time, that\u2019s how nature works\nMe: carnivorous animals have no other choice and will die without consumption of other animals. We humans have a choice,our bodies we will not die, and we havent evolved to consume meat to the extent that we do in modern society. \nHim: animals were made for us to be consumed; WE humans gave them life by breeding them at the rate we do, and if we hadn\u2019t done so then they wouldnt have ever been alive. \nMe: their species all existed before we bread them to the extent we did. How do you connect \u2018being bread by humans\u2019 to \u2018purpose is to be killed for consumption\u2019? Are you saying their death is justified because we bread them? \nHim: their existence is not the same as humans. \nMe: how? Why? Explain scientifically \nHim: they are not as intelligent as humans \nMe: are you equating value and worth with intelligence? \nHim: yes I guess so\nMe: you do realize that\u2019s a speciesist view?\nHim: yes... I realize it \nMe: ok....\n\nThe conversation ended here because I realized that he knows he is embodying speciesism but fails to want to change that view, despite it being completely contradictory to his disgust with what happens in slaughterhouses. I\u2019m thoroughly confused by the nonsense going on in his lack of logic and would greatly appreciate it if you all could help me to build a better argument for when I encounter this sort of speciesist mentality again, so that I can talk to him again or for future interactions.

I moved here because of a difficult situation I was living in elsewhere and so, because I\u2019m still looking for a job here, I don\u2019t have work friends to connect with. \n\nHow do I go about this ? Why does it seem so hard to make friends even as a young and somewhat outgoing person? I appreciate anyone\u2019s advice in advance.\n\nEdit: my interests/ passions are: music (electronic, indie, alternative, ambient), nature, philosophy, spirituality, holistic health, art, science, environmentalism, veganism, and psychology"

They easily could turn the past and future theme into the most incredible gameplay that will leave all players happy and give them more to do in post game. I want to share this idea of a future DLC with you all. Professor Sada and Turo appear in their respective versions, but to make it a more fluent read I\u2019ll write this from a Scarlet / Professor Sada point of view. Since this is a long read I\u2019ll give you a short version first and an even shorter tl;dr at the end.\n\n \n\n\\_\\_SHORT VERSION\\_\\_\n\n \n\nTitan and Paradox Pokemon appear, attacking cities. You beat them, following one of them through a rip in space-time. You find yourself in the distant past, find notes from a mysterious person and save an injured Celebi who closes the portal upon your return. More time-space portals appear, you defeat Titans who guard them, explore the other side and find living fossil Pokemon, future forms of Pokemon, Hisuian Pokemon and forms of other regions. These places can also hold herba mystica, which can be obtained by defeating the Titan guarding them. Upon leaving through each portal you have Celebi close it. Slowly you learn through more mysterious notes that Professor Sada / Turo wasn\u2018t killed, but transported through time and space. At some point Professor Jacq (your Biology teacher) calls you, telling you Paldea is being overrun by Titan and Paradox Pokemon. You defeat them and meet Nemona in front of the Great Crater. On your way down many more Pokemon attack you, but before being overrun the Elite 4, Gym leaders and Champions (1-2 from other regions, like Cynthia) come to your rescue (insert cool cutscene). You and your friends head down deeper. Bit by bit your friends stay behind to battle more Paradox / Titans. You go through a portal, meet and battle by the side of Professor Sada / Turo and head on to find the cause of everything: A Pokemon who is stuck in tera crystals. You free and battle it, after which it thanks you for helping rescuing it and helping it snap out of its confused state. It then jumps through a portal with Celebi. From here on out portals appear less frequent and close after 24 hours. You can find ancient / fossil, future, paradox, hisuian and Titan Pokemon here, sometimes even raid dens. A big tournament with the Gym leaders, Elite 4 and Champions is hosted with new options: 4, 8, 12 or 16 battles, different level options and trainers having a pallette of 12 Pokemon, of which 6 are picked randomly for them to use (for less predictability). Celebi and the Mysterious other Pokemon are waiting for you somewhere behind one of the portals.\n\n \n\nOf course the Battle Tower and some other things should be added as well.\n\n \n\n\\_\\_LONG VERSION\\_\\_\n\n \n\nAfter you finish the main game you can trigger the DLC by talking to a young kid in Mesagoza. This kid will tell you all about their favorite Psyduck, how they grew up together, how they shared everything they had, but a few days ago a bright light appeared and Psyduck vanished without a trace.\n\n \n\nAfter this you will be called by Arvin who tells you about Titan and Paradox Pokemon who appeared, but sometimes vanished again quickly. Some are still threatening towns of the Paldea region. It is your mission to find and beat them. Arvin asks you to help him figure out where these Pokemon came from and where they are vanishing to. After beating your second Titan you follow it, witnessing it disappear into a weird shimmer in mid-air, which has a glow about itself that strongly reminds you of the tera crystals. Upon inspecting closer a Titan Aerodactyl appears out of this weird portal / gateway, apparently guarding it.\n\n \n\nYou and Arven give it your all and deafeat the Titan, which quickly hurries back through the portal. Despite doubts you both enter through the portal and find yourself in a strange stony land. One of the first things you see is a Tyrantrum attacking a herd of Shieldon and Bastiodon. After a quick rescue you start exploring this mysterious land and eventually find the lost Psyduck huddled behind a smallish green Pokemon. Both are getting attacked by the Titan Aerodactyl you defeated earlier. Upon spotting you two the Titan eats herba mystica to power up and attacks you again.\n\n \n\nYou deafeat the Titan and inspect Psyduck, which seems unharmed, thanks to the Pokemon who protected it: Celebi. While protecting Psyduck from harm Celebi itself seems to have gotten hurt. Arven uses some herba mystica to create medicine for Celebi, which gives it enough strenght to move. You take it and Psyduck back through the portal, after which Celebi uses its powers to close the portal, before falling asleep.\n\n \n\nYou decide to take care of Celebi, help it recover, and in the meantime take Psyduck back to its owner. The owner hands you a piece of paper that Psyduck held in its mouth, which turns out to be a dossier of Tyrantrum (kind of like the one for Big Tusk, but with more details), revealing location, habits and a personal note in which the author reveals their excitement about getting to witness the ancient past and long gone Pokemon species.\n\n \n\nArvin let\u2019s you know he believes you two experienced the same thing: You travelled into the past. He also wonders who could have written this dossier and what happened to that person. Celebi is known for travelling through time and Arven theorizes that it probably came here to close the rip in space and time.\n\n \n\nFrom here on out you keep hearing of Titan and mysterious, unknown Pokemon appearing and attacking cities and people. Accompanied by Arvin, Nemona, Penny or one of Team Star you find these Pokemon, defeat them in battle and follow them through the portals. Each portal brings you to a new destination. Sometimes you find yourself inside a deep, ancient jungle or at the foot of a massive volcano. Other times you wander through empty cities in the far off future, always discovering future, ancient, hisuian and regional forms Pokemon wandering together with Pokemon of your own time, who have seemed to come there through other rips in time and space.\n\n \n\nOn the other side of the portals you find more dossiers, each time with a personal note from the author. From these you gather that this person is looking for and finding these rips in space and time, seeking to understand their origin and also hoping to find a way back home.\n\n \n\nWith each Dossier it becomes more and more clear that the author is no other than Professor Sada, Arvin\u2019s mom. The explosion that supposedly killed her opened the first rip in space-time and transported her to the ancient past. From there she found more and more portals and saw the danger in them, so she started studying each and every one. The technology in the distant future helped her come close to an answer, but she wasn\u2019t quite there yet.\n\n \n\nAfter finding and defeating a particular Pokemon on the other side of a portal you return, where you get called by Professor Jacq, who tells you that (cutscene start) all of Paldea being overrun by Titan and Paradox Pokemon, with many of them heading toward the deep crater. Others are attacking cities, causing rampages.\n\n \n\nProfessor Jacq asks you to take care of some of the Pokemon attacking the city. He already called Nemona and some others, who are also going to help. Your job: Find and beat the Pokemon attacking cities (this makes them hurry through a portal which Celebi then closes). After the last Pokemon is beat, Nemona calls you and asks to meet up with you in front of the great crater. Apparently many weirdly behaving Pokemon started moving towards the crater and Professor Jacq wants you to check it out.\n\n \n\nYou meet her there and start heading down, battling Titans and hordes of Pokemon (double battles, anyone?), but slowly you are being overrun. This is when Arvin, Penny, the gym leaders, Elite 4 and 1-2 Champions from other regions (like Cynthia) appear to help out in one massive battle (insert cutscene where they all come running, throw out their Pokeballs and launch their attack, clashing with an oncoming horde of Pokemon).\n\n \n\nYou, Arvin, Nemona and Penny are being sent deeper into the crater. Whatever is causing these disturbances in space-time and freaking out the Pokemon has its origins down there. On the way down you are almost being run over by more Paradox, Hisuian, Ancient and Future Pokemon, which you have to battle in single, double, tripple and horde battles (5 Pokemon attack at once), until you make your way to a massive portal. From this an even bigger than usual Titan appears, but Penny tells you to keep on going, she will take care of it with her Eeveelutions. After going through the portal you encounter two more Titans, which Arvin and Nemona take on. You hurry through the next portal behind them. Here you encounter another Titan and just as you are about to face it a second one comes storming from the side, threatening to trample right over you. At the last second the Titan is being pushed aside by something. A Pokemons attack. Next to you appears Professor Sada, who is more than surprised to see you. In a double battle you defeat both Titans, upon which Professor Sada tells you about a certain mysterious Pokemon who is somehow connected to Celebi. She found cave paintings in the past and data in the future about this Pokemon, but the present doesn\u2019t seem to know it. She tells you this Pokemon most likely was injured by whatever caused the great crater and it got itself stuck within the Tera Crystals at the bottom of the crater. Lately it has been gaining consciousness again, but it isn\u2019t in control of its powers yet. She leads you to another portal that will take you to the bottom of the crater and asks you to find and stop that Pokemon.\n\n \n\nGoing through this last portal you find the mystery Pokemon inside a giant Tera Crystal, as if it had been frozen in it. Terastalizing your Pokemon and attacking the crystal makes it crumble, which frees the Pokemon that now attacks you. You have to beat it, but can\u2019t catch it yet. After doing so Celebi comes out, greets its long lost friend and gives it some herba mystica it has been saving for it. This makes the mystery Pokemon gain control of its powers again, after which it thanks you and jumps away through a newly created portal, followed by Celebi.\n\n \n\nAll portals vanish that instant and the trainers who helped to fend off the hoard of Pokemon come to see how you are faring. Coming from the opposite side and heading straight for Arvin is Professor Sada, who weeps with joy.\n\n \n\nCelebrations are held for the saviors of Paldea and a big tournament has been announced. The Gym leaders, Elite 4, Champions and guests from other countries all participate. Preparations will last 1 week. After this announcement Professor Sada approaches you and informs you that certain Paradox and Titan Pokemon, the ones that didn\u2019t make it back through a portal, still roam Paldea, ready to battle and ready to be caught. She also says that portals are still appearing all over Paldea. With Celebi out there and the mystery Pokemon having regained its powers these portals should close after 24 hours. Still she asks you to help keep an eye on things and hands you a device from the future, which can close these portals. She also says the mystery Pokemon might be waiting behind one of the portals, along with many Pokemon from the past, of which we only have fossils today, Pokemon from the future, which we know nothing about yet, hisuian and regional form Pokemon, unknown to Paldea and many other Pokemon who haven\u2019t been seen in Paldea before.\n\n \n\nProfessor Jacq asks you to fill your Pokedex with data from these newly found Pokemon as it might help a lot in understanding Pokemons evolution throughout time.\n\n \n\nWith this the DLC has been finished, but portals can still be found all over Paldea and each holds different Pokemon from the past, present and future. Sometimes enough energy trickles through these portals so you can even find raid dens on the other side and other times the portals are guarded by Titan Pokemon (single or duals), which guard herba mystica. This gives players the chance to catch 6-star-raid-den Paradox Pokemon, keep battling Titans and it gives players another way to farm herba mystica. Of course this also brings back all Fossil Pokemon, Hisuian Pokemon, other regional forms and new Paradox Pokemon, which can now be encountered behind the portals and sometimes even in present Paldea.\n\n \n\nThe champion tournament has been improved. You can now battle the Elite 4, Gym leaders and even some Champions from other regions in this tournament. Additionally two new options have been given: You can choose whether the tournament consists of 4, 8, 12 or 16 battles. The second thing you can decide is the level of your opponents Pokemon. Choose between the categories 80-88, 89-97 and 100. Each trainer you face also has 12 Pokemon, 6 of which are randomly chosen each time they battle. This makes for less predictability. Of course the battle tower will also be opened.\n\n \n\nThanks for reading\n\n \n\ntl;dr: You find Celebi and journey through rips in space and time, defeating many Titan- and Paradox Pokemon, encounter ancient, future and regional variant Pokemon and have Celebi close the rips in space and time. Through notes on the other side of these rips you learn that Professor Sada / Turo wasn't killed, but sent through time, and is looking for a way home. You defeat the Pokemon responsible for the rips in space-time, saving Paldea from destruction."

In the last raid it hit me with 6 damaging moves, 4 of those were crits and it's always like this.\n \nMost people try lowering its stats, which of course ups its attack stat or they use ghost types for some reason, but assuming you actually get paired with decent players, what's a good overall strategy for this raid?\n \nOne guy used Sinistea to change Annihilapes ability, which was a great first move and I'm thinking of raising a defensive Torkoal with the ability Shell Armor to defend against those crits and give it Clear Smog to negate Annihilapes Bulk Ups, Will-O-Wisp to lower its damage output and maybe iron defense + rest for survivability.

Around 4 months we had eliminated the playpen since he was potty trained and used the pee pad without issue but around 5 months he regressed and started having accidents, so we went back to square one w/ crate and playpen. We take him out for 4 walks everyday without fail at 8am, noon, then 6pm and 11pm. One of those walks tends to be longer and we will get his energy out there. Is it normal for a 6 month old Beagle to still have frequent accidents when let out to free roam even though he knows the pee pad and consistently pees/poos every walk? \n\nWe've also taken away the free fill water container and are giving him bowls of it measured by requirement (and if he indicates he needs more water - sometimes he licks the empty water bowl and scratches it). Food wise if I have no time, he has free feed bowl but otherwise he gets his food through his puzzle toys. \n\nAnyways, I was under the impression that he would have bladder control by now and thought those 4 walks would suffice. Yesterday the stinker decided it was a great idea while I was working to walk past his pee pad and go pee on our White sofa and rug! Luckily it's washable. \n\nAlso, I've been WFH for a while now and if I'm not home he will sleep consistently through 5 hours like clockwork. But since I'm within reach he fights sleep and will whine all day for my attention or to be let out (even without being able to see me), and only sleeps for an hour at a time. Suffice to say I'm having trouble working from home. Is it normal for them to whine like this? I've tried ignoring all I can, it's just driving me insane now. \n\nWhat could we be doing better? Or is this a normal occurence for a 6 month old Beagle and we just have to keep consistent and patient? \n\nRegarding teething he seems to be almost done but has his teething toys that help. We've just had to get rid of any soft toys as he gets right through in 10 mins. \n\nTLDR: Our 6 month old puppy still has accidents and whines constantly for attention.

Recently (before the pandemic) things seemed to start to look up a bit. But now that there's a pandemic, I got rejected from artschool (which I've been trying to get into for 3 years), I lost my job. And my friend (M18) died in a carcrash. And due to the whole social distancing stuff, and me living with my mom who is a heart patient. I did not feel safe going out to see my friend one last time before he got cremated. Furthermore before my friend's death he was talking about feeling miserable and I keep wondering if there is something I could've done to help me. Now I'm also in a new shitty 9/5 retail job where I get treated pretty bad and just thinking about the job makes me feel like I'm suffocating. I'm thinking of quitting my job but I can't really afford to do so. (I could live without my job as I live with my parents but I have a lot of debt to pay off) There's a lot on my plate rn, and I don't really know how to deal with it. Due to lockdown I can't see my psychiatrist and I feel stuck. I'm worried that in the future I'll be forced to stay in a crappy workspace. I wanted to go to artschool because that's what I'm passionate about, but I feel like if my life has to keep sucking the way it does right now, maybe I should stop living it. I have had suicidal tendencies in the past, and I know it's not something I want to deal with. And rationally thinking, I know life will probably get better, but right now I'm not feeling it. If anyone at all has any advice for me on how I can start improving my life again, please help me."

Since then I've connected many dots and I'm almost sure that the reason for his depression was that he'd realised that I wasn't changing my mind. He'd also told me a few times that he thought he wouldn't feel fulfilled in the future. I was heartbroken and it took me almost 6 months to move on as he kept bothering me because we share the same friends. \n\nI am not necessarily looking for a relationship right now but I am taking some classes at uni with a cute guy. A month ago or so he started some small talk about a project we are doing in groups. Since then he's helped me with the project for which I thanked him a few times (even in front of the whole class during a presentation) and, surprisingly, it made him very happy. He's started to approach me more and seemed to look for excuses to talk to me.\n\nThis week he seemed very nervous around me. He was fidgeting in his chair, fixing his hair and beard all the time and doing some other things that made me think he might be interested. So I joined him during a break for dinner and it seemed that both of us had a good time because he chilled out a bit. \n\nHe seems so unlike my ex. He's got a calm demeanor, has good manners and seems very mature but is also funny and playful. He is just so cute I would want to hug him all the time (I haven't done that yet sadly, lol) . He makes me feel good and kinda... safe I guess? \n\nI usually take the initiative when I notice men are interested and ask them out. However, I've started to think that it's a terrible idea as he's most probably not childfree. We are both from Poland and our country is still very conservative. I want to simply ask him if he wants to grab a coffee without specifying it's a date (unless he asks about that... which I will confirm).\n\nI am just scarred I will embarass myself and destroy everything if I admit that I am childfree and I will ruin the chance to stay friends. But he seems he wants more than just to be friends...\n\nHave any of you been in a similar situation? I think I could use some words of encouragement or discouragement..."

You can be better. You can still choose to make the world better. You can donate, and create stuff, and be kind to people, and care.\n\nYou can raise little scientists, or artists, or entrepreneurs, or humanitarians. The fact that the world is bad means that we need to make it better.\n\nI would argue all choices are inherently selfish. I choose to have a kid in order to hopefully expose them to good. You choose to not have a kid in order to spare them from bad. Both choices are inherently meaningless, which means I can't stop you and you can't stop me, and any ethical arguments are moot.\n\nI would rather let my child choose to not exist than make that choice for them ahead of time."

Most of the jokes can't be funny without the person telling them. And, unlike in other mediums, stand-up jokes are some of the most heavily scrutinized when it comes to copying. The funny can't exist without the funny man.\n\nArt isn't like that!! Find me another medium of art that can't allow derivative work, or where at least one idea can't exist without it's ideator!\n\nStand-up comedy is an art form as much as Sonic OCs are."

For many people a lot of work has to put into it and the process can go a long time.\n\nMaybe your resistance also comes from not wanting to change, dunno, but ofc I am currently not in a position to make an assesement about that. It would just be beneficial for you to see if that is what is going on inside yourself.\n\nIf you are honestly willing to make changes, and think that (one of) the reasons for why you currently do not benefit from Ayahuasca as much as you would like is due to some form of (physical and/or emotional) resistance, you could try a few things:\n\n* try another psychedelic medicine like San Pedro. It is known to in general be more 'bright' and gentle in its effects. That might helo you to so to speak 'bypass' the resistance better. But ask someone who professionally works with San Pedro first if that might be a good idea for your case.\n* take a lower dosage of Ayahuasca, that is perfectly fine if that helps you.\n* go into the ceremony with the intent of dealing with another issue that is not or less connected to the childhood trauma you mentioned. It maybe can even be something neutral. That also could ease you up over time.\n* if you believe in or are open to the idea of spirits (plant spirits, helper / healer spirits, etc), ask the plant or other spirits to treat you gently and with respect, or something similar with your own words and intent behind it before you go into a ceremony. Or ask to get to know the plant medicine / etc better, so you can get more of a feel for it\n* maybe the point at the moment is not to \"go deeper\" for whatever reason. maybe there is something else that has to be dealt with first atm that is of higher importance. maybe you so to speak need to \"be rebuild\" or stabilized first before you can \"go deeper\".\n* maybe you could also go to another retreat or facilitator or another place with other people where you can do Ayahuasca (or other plant medicines), go get another perspective on it\n\nFor many people a lot of healing is also physical level, e.g. on a muscular level and not just on an emotional level, since a lot of trauma (especially when it is very overwhelming), can also cause physical damage (that can result in a change in e.g. ones posture, facial expression, cause the muscles to cramp on a more permanent basis, and also behavior), that has to be dealt with in order to heal emotions and certain behaviors, etc....\n\nMaybe what you need atm is physical healing and not 'diving deeper into these emotions' as you called it. Who knows, maybe 'diving deeper' is simply unnecessary or even detrimental for your process, maybe at least for now.\n\nYou'll find something that works for you.",

My inability to finish things when I'm depressed has ruined my school years essentially, but that's another story. Since this year I got to study for my own and that means a new format I was not used to, but I was fine and I managed, until last month. My schedule and my concentration started to drop, making me loose control over my study tracks. Then until last 2 weeks I figured out I was starting to get depressed, again. I tried to communicate this to my parents but my mom won't move a finger because I'm being \"lazy and irresponsible again\" and my father got angry at me because he pays for my education, and I know he's aware of that but I'm sure he thinks my current state will vanish in a few days, he thought wrong. Now I'm starting to have suicidal thoughts and constant self-pity for no rational reason. Now everytime I tell myself or try to study I want to cry, and then to cope with the pain I distract myself doing anything to elevate my mood a little bit like eating any chocolate in my home, or watching YouTube videos or series to forget reality for a moment. And everytime I realize I waste my time I want to die or get vanished in this world for being an idiot. Due to my current state I didn't showered or take care of my hygiene for an entire week, then regret about it and now having difficulties to even move my body for a fucking shower, gladly I got  a shower yesterday but you should now how difficult it is. Now I want to study but it is still a hard task since I get distracted easily and then I keep having negative thoughts about myself. Because of this I want to get professional help but until I don't move a feet out my home I won't get it, and that's the saddest part because I have social anxiety and it's hard to get involved in the real world again after 1 month of not going out. I wanted to get along with my only friends but most of the time they're busy. And everyday when my mom comes back for work she drops my self-steem and gets me out of my nerves and then wondering why I'm sad.\nI just wanted to vent and hope anyone can read this since I can't talk about feelings like a normal person and\nI don't know what to do."

It is precisely because I abhor boasting that I dislike the term \"gifted\". I don't consider it boastful to claim to be more intelligent than average, as long as it is true and not done to brag. Similarly, I don't consider it controversial to say that most people are stupid, although I wouldn't single people out and call them dumb to their face, unless they were acting like a belligerent bigot. Then again, my behavior does change over time as I learn and grow, and I was certainly more eager to insult others when I was an adolescent.\n\nI have a feeling that the most intelligent people don't generally like to boast, because they really don't need to, and I'm sure many are already wary enough of latent resentment from their peers without also rubbing salt in their wounds.

Heartwarming indeed, and a bit surprising, to know that *someone* actually read my comment, let alone enjoyed it :p\n\nWhen, as in this instance, I\u2019m publicly disagreeing with somewhat intelligent people, I\u2019m actually super particular about my writing. I take great care to be truthful and expressive, but unfortunately this results in very dense writing, saturated with meaning but ostensibly long-winded and meandering to those who only skim over it without patience or interest. I specifically remember adding in the \u201calmost\u201d, to add the nuance that I still find it worthwhile to seek and disseminate these truths, despite the great effort required and the probable futility of this exchange (as well as to express my personal resistance to regretful thinking, in favor of framing \u201cmistakes\u201d more as \u201clessons\u201d).\n\nFuck me, I need to contain myself a bit more when writing these comments.

I don\u2019t remember enough of it but there were some slightly absurd moments. I think protagonist guy had a crush on the Glory Hallelujah girl, but might\u2019ve ended up with the Violent girl instead. Honestly I\u2019m not even sure if it was in second person, but it was in a school setting I think. Don\u2019t think it was an Adult book, maybe not contemporary Young Adult either though.

                "body": "Hey, so, lately I've been struggling with what I'd consider to be Existential OCD. For context, I have been diagnosed with OCD two different times in my life, and it began about 16 years ago. I recovered by a lot when I was 18/19, but it flared up badly again about 9 months ago, and my dp/dr (depersonalization/derealization) has also been triggered more chronically and severely than I ever had it before. Lately I mainly just get hit with sudden \u201cexistential hyper-awareness\u201d, for lack of a better term. Like how some OCD sufferers get hyper-awareness around their own blinking or breathing... for me it\u2019s a hyper-awareness surrounding my own existence and consciousness. I get a variety of existential thoughts and fears, all of which tend to terrify me and just leave me feeling more disconnected, confused, overwhelmed, and alone than before. It\u2019s like I\u2019m borderline pulled out of \u201cthe game of life\u201d psychologically and suddenly I\u2019m seeing myself and everyone else as characters in this weird \u201creality\u201d that honestly doesn\u2019t feel that real to me... it seems more like a game, dream, simulation... it makes it hard for me to enjoy anything or to feel properly engaged. In addition, it really does frighten me and leaves me feeling very trapped, and overwhelmed. I wish I knew how to overcome this and if it\u2019s even *possible* to do so since I start to doubt whether it\u2019s really just OCD/anxiety and dp/dr or if I\u2019m just permanently going to be this way. It almost feels like when a character breaks the third wall in a movie or show, as though I\u2019m looking at the \u201ccamera\u201d and I\u2019m like... how the fuck am I here? Why is everything like it is, and not a different way? How am I conscious? How am I thinking? Why is there 'something' instead of nothing? If there's a God, who made God? Why is there a God? How can I know that anything\u2019s real? What even is \u201creal\u201d, what does it mean? How does no one else seem to question these things, or how do they not seem bothered by these questions and lack of answers? Etc. I feel so overwhelmed and terrified. Can anyone relate to this? And does anyone have any recommendations? Can I recover from this and get back to 'normal'? I try not to ruminate on them, and to just accept not knowing, but these thoughts will hit me out of nowhere and instantly trigger my feeling of 'unreality' which feeds into the thoughts more."

For instance, my HOCD often manifests as self-harm and it flares up whenever I handle sharp knives. When I handle a sharp knife, my mind creates visual intrusive thoughts consisting of harming myself in various quite disturbing ways with it, and I imagine how it would feel. During this, I get this weird energy in my body, sort of like an inner restlessness and agitation that sort of dares me to really do it, like to just quickly take the knife and rapidly slice or stab it closer and closer to myself as a compulsion. Obviously I resist this, but I have had compulsively-oriented OCD in the past and it's the same inner energy I'd feel before engaging in my compulsions. \n\nDoes anyone else get this?

                "body": "Hey all, so this is really just me 'theory-crafting' as opposed to claiming any concrete 'truth'. However, for me it rings true, and I feel many others may glean some insight from it as well. \n\nSo anyways, something I've realized is I often treat my inner self (my emotions, my subconscious, my inner child) the way my parents would have reacted to and treated my childhood self. Obviously we all know that our parental figures may play a heavy hand in shaping us, especially as far as our implicit beliefs and our automatic behaviours and patterns. We both consciously and unconsciously model ourselves after them in many ways- they're typically our primary (and perhaps only) example of \"how to be a parent/guardian\". Now, when I refer to them as being an example to us of 'how to be a guardian' I don't mean this only as far as determining how you'd treat and raise any future children or \"dependents\" you may have. Instead (and more pertinently to this discussion) it may inform how we parent \\*ourselves\\*- our emotional, subconscious inner child who is sort of our lifelong 'dependent'. \n\nTo provide an example... my father was a generally \"absent\" figure (emotionally). He'd often play video games or do the things that he wanted to do, and would actively dismiss me or even punish me when I desired his love and attention. When he \\*did\\* give me attention, it was often negative attention involving anger/aggression and frustration if/when I didn't conform to his will. It's true to say I generally felt ambivalent towards him: fearful and tense, but still wanting that love and acceptance. For simplicity, I'll define his negative behaviour towards me as generally being: Dismissive, Distracted/Absent, Authoritarian, Aggressive, and Controlling. \n\nMy mother was what you would call a \"worrywart\". She was very anxious, very protective, and often warned me excessively of any and all dangers. While she was generally not emotionally or physically dismissive or absent like my dad, she would ignore my unhealthy habits and patterns either because she expected them to just 'go away', or because she herself didn't always recognize them as being unhealthy since she was so anxious herself. I would define her behaviour towards me as being: Indulgent, Anxious/Fearful, Overprotective, and Passive. (It's worth noting however that my mother was also sensitive to my \\[emotional, physical\\] needs, loving, warm, and generally present/engaged. And I know my father also loves me as well. So it's certainly not all negative- I'm just focusing more on that for the sake of this discussion.)\n\nNow, how does this relate to my own behaviours and habits in the present? Well, as an example, when I experience a \"negative\" inner emotion, or something I do not wish to feel, I tend to go down one of several avenues. I either distract myself and seek to ignore it, I react with internal aggression and try to control it and bend it to my will, or I over-indulge it and actively feed the negativity with even more negative energy and attention. None of these reactions are \"healthy\" or conducive to my long-term well-being, and the link to how my parents would've reacted to my childhood self is, in my opinion, reasonably evident in many cases. \n\nNow, I do wish to point out that I do not intend to BLAME them or to shirk personal accountability. We are ALL responsible for our own growth, and for the overcoming and relinquishing of our own unhealthy patterns and habits. These may have started in childhood, and may have not initially been our fault, but at some point we must take accountability. There's a difference between looking to explain the context of why we are how we are, and pointing fingers/hating those that we  \"blame\". Let's avoid doing this, and try to understand that in many cases our parents were doing the best they could with what they knew- they very likely were carrying some unhealthy habits of their own from \\*their\\* parents, and so the cycle goes. Very important to realize. \n\nSo... to sum up... our parents are generally our first real \"relationships\" in life, we use them as a model and foundation for a great many things, including how we go about acting as guardians to ourselves, especially as we grow up and gain more autonomy. We learn many behaviours and habits from our parents, and if we grew up having our childhood selves dismissed, abused, fear-mongered to, etc, it's very possible we'd use that same model to interact with our own inner world/self as that's really all we knew. From here, we learn to essentially try to abuse, control, and dismiss ourselves rather than act as compassionate neutral observers to our feelings and experiences. We are capable of dismantling these unhealthy internal structures, but we must first acknowledge them, and then work towards building the better, healthier habits and models we may not have had prior. This is how we can gain long-term freedom and growth. \n\nI hope some of you find this insightful and/or helpful, and I'd love to hear other's thoughts on this. Thanks in advance. :)"

I figure many others on this sub also struggle with anxiety. So as some background, I do also get full on 'panic episodes' where my fight/flight system triggers and it tends to last quite a long time and places me a state of pure terror. With that said, I've only been diagnosed with GAD and OCD, with 'panic attacks', social anxiety, and depression listed as 'special notes/features'. However, even in moments where my fight/flight hasn't fully triggered, I can find myself in this state of what I'd call severe 'darkness and dread' where everything around me, and all of my thoughts, feel overwhelming, \"evil\"/threatening, irrational, intense, and ominous. That's really the best way I could describe it, just absolute dread/darkness as if you've shifted into a parallel reality where everything is 'wrong' and menacing. I can feel claustrophobic of my surroundings as well as 'trapped' within myself. I get the strong desire to escape, but I can't because I mainly just want to escape my feelings and thoughts. I often also experience a pit in my stomach, nausea or other stomach upset, lump in throat, shaking, dizziness, lightheadedness, head pressure, inner ear pressure, breathing feels like its not 'doing enough', and perhaps worst of all, derealized/depersonalized. I realize a lot of this can sound characteristic of a panic attack, but the issue is this state can last many, many hours and doesn't always seem to bud into a 100% full attack.. it's more like as severe of anxiety as I can feel without it entirely and unmistakably crossing into that threshold. I think the worst part is feeling like I'm 'crazy' as my thoughts become incredibly irrational, paranoid, and see danger everywhere and in everything. I also dislike seeing myself as this frantic, fearful person under the thumb of her fears, thoughts, and sensations. Things and ideas that wouldn't normally bother me whatsoever can feel like the most terrifying shit possible when I'm like this, and even when I try to stay levelheaded and see through it, the feelings remain and make it difficult to be totally chill or rational.\n\nSorry to rant, but I'm curious if anyone can relate to this at all? And if so, if anyone has any suggestions? It hurts me feeling so defective, broken, 'crazy', and as though I'm somehow permanently broken and can't ever heal from this. I hate how my life can feel so defined and framed by this, and how my thoughts no longer feel like my own, or like I can trust them. I feel fragile, even though I know deep down that I'm strong.

My Pure-O OCD mostly revolves around existential thoughts (what is 'reality', what if this is a dream, how can I know if any of this is real, etc), but I also get OCD around schizophrenia and psychosis. Anyways, since yesterday I have been dealing with pretty severe brain fog, general dread/anxiety, as well as derealization. Due to this, my thoughts have been feeling more real and intense to me, like my grasp between what's real and what isn't becomes blurred; that my thoughts have more weight to them. \n\nI guess I'm just curious if this happens for any other OCD sufferers, or if I should be concerned about this morphing into something worse (psychosis). It's not that I fully believe my thoughts or obsessions, but my ability to reason and 'keep my head above water' (stay levelheaded) feels severely blunted. Admittedly I have experienced this before, when my anxiety gets particularly bad, but every time it happens I become afraid that it's going to get worse and worse and I'll finally 'snap'.

Functional malefics on the other hand, help you patch the holes in your boat, for a Virgo ascendant those are Moon, Mars, and Jupiter.

I'd only proceed in getting an electional talisman once there is a relationship built with these archetypes, altough a Mercury one ought to help either way, the ascendant ruler will always be benefic, even if it's in a bad place in the chart.\n\nAnd happy to help, best of luck.",

He's already strong but unless u want to do something like shadow work I'd avoid cuz the 8th house deals with our deepest vulnerabilities.

When the \"thinker\" subsides, what's is left? And don't answer this with a thought but simply be aware of what is there in the absence of it and you will see that you don't dissapear, there is still an \"ISness\" and that is Pure Awareness. \n\nThink of a blank canvas, everything in existence can be drawn in that canvas, a rock, a person, any story of the world, but underneath it all it always remains blank, that is the fundamental Beingness that is in all things and is all things. \n\nYou are thinking from a stand point of materialistic atheism with the atom stuff, which won't get you very far because it's trying to percieve things with the thinker, the moment you try to quantify what awareness is, you are drawing in the blank canvas and no longer percieving the purity of it's nature.\n\nThis is what stuff like meditation, yoga, and other spiritual practices are for, to percieve beyond the thinker. Psychedelics do this relatively well because they shut down the thinker and cultivate deep stillness which allows one to percieve their essence identity. \n\nHopefully that explains it, it's not the easiest task to explain these concepts in a rational manner without writing a whole essay on them haha.",

So in my eyes, everything IS conscious, just to different degrees, enlightened masters recognize this and can perceive that underlying Pure Consciousness that exists in all things. Most of humanity has reached the level of self-awareness where they can perceive themselves as an individual through the use of thought, but not yet at that universal level of Pure Awareness.\n\nSo something like a rock or chair hasn't reached the degree of consciousness where it can think, but at its fundamental basis is still Pure Awareness, it is just that Pure Awareness hasn't grown enough in it for it to become self-aware of being an object.",

Predominantly, I've burned resins for the most part, but I'm trying to burn less because it's a hassle having to light the coal each time. I have little to no experience with cones, sticks, or other means of incense. So just looking for some help.\n\nThe types of resin I enjoy the most and frankincense, white copal, and benzoin sumatra. Preferably some incense around those notes would be the best for me (sweet, bright, brisk). I've tried some Shroff incenses but they smelled too woody for me, superhit and nagchampa by satya I really liked, and besides that, I tried herb & earth rose which was subtle but I enjoyed (I love bright but sweet flowery smells) and triloka blue lotus which was nice (although the others I liked are better).\n\nI've seen Mother India get a lot of praise in this sub, I've been thinking about getting the sample kit but the shipping costs are horrendous (literally half the price of the sample box). I'm still debating on getting it though, I just fear it might not be what I'm looking for.  \n\n\nAlso, I have heard of Fred Soll from some of you, I might eventually try that but his incenses are very expensive when compared to other options."

I had never done Salvia before other than chewing it and I smoked probably around 15-20mg of 20x Salvia.\n\nInitially, it was hellish, my heart felt like it was about to beat out of my chest, but I remembered to cultivate my meditation practice by becoming pure, and witnessing awareness. Needless to say, within a couple of seconds the experience went from hellish to interesting. It wasn't necessarily pleasant but it wasn't bad either as many describe, it was fascinating. As I closed my eyes I saw an infinite convertor belt in the shape of a semi 2-dimensional square while I got molded and shaped into it without any say in the matter. It really felt like a rift into a dimension completely beyond my comprehension was being opened.\n\nAnyways, I'm wondering, for those of you that have a spiritual practice and experience deep states of stillness and pure awareness during meditation, have you tried approaching Sally in this way? It led to the experience of very intense ego death, which kind of killed the whole dysphoric aspect of it since the concepts of \"good\" and \"bad\" ceased to exist, completely free of judgment. I still don't if I got much from it or what the point of it was, but at least it felt like a challenge to learn to surrender to a deeper state of presence. Definitely a very interesting substance, I've tried a lot of things and nothing was as weird as Salvia."

Despite that, I've gotten very good results with Saturn, more so spiritually.\n\nWhat I've come to understand though is that Saturn is actually the ultimate representation of internal peace, it symbolically represents our ability to deal with challenging situations in a manner were we can remain at peace with what IS. This is why Saturn is exalted in Libra, the sign of peace and harmony. \n\nI've personally found Saturn super willing to work with me as long as my approach came with uttermost respect and humility. Not to mention, but Saturn is also representative of compassion and love towards the collective; the ability to understand the suffering of the world and be of service to those in pain. This is ultimately done through connecting deeply with others through understanding their pain with love and compassion (hence why Saturn is exalted in Libra).\n\nI've found it incredibly profound to work with Saturn in this manner and it has brought me such growth, acceptance and maturity in such a small period of time. So I thought I'd share for the sake of sharing. \n\nOn another note though, I've studied some Vedic astrology using the tropical zodiac, and in the 9th harmonic chart (which shows the meaning and purpose one derives from a specific planet, aka harmonic of the 9th house) I have Saturn exalted. So this could be the cause of why I've found so much purpose in working with him.\n\nNow since these are just my experiences, proceed with caution. I'd recommend taking an approach which ultimately aims towards the highest good of all, so we can be of greater service to humanity (Saturn being the servant). I've personally gotten so much support from Saturn when taking this humble approach. \n\nThank you for reading and hopefully it is of use to some of you in some way. Best of wishes."

It\u2019s meant to be like a fun guessing game between friends mostly I think. \n\nSo... here\u2019s the situation... I was just having a dream, and it wasn\u2019t a bad dream at all, though it had a slightly sinister undertone. So anyway, I was hanging out in a bedroom with two of my \u201cschool friends\u201d (I don\u2019t know them irl, and I\u2019m not in school anymore). But, one of them said those words! And it made me realise I was dreaming! \n\nSo, thinking I was being sly (not really, I kinda just wanted to see how they would respond) I said \u201cYa know, I hear those words a lot in my dreams!\u201d Both my friends both just turned quiet AND ONE OF THEM literally pushed my head down with full force, and I went into sleep paralysis... lmfao WHAT I am so scarred rn. Terrified to ever try that again. \n\nIt\u2019s what I get for trying to break the fourth wall I suppose ahahaaa"

When the VIX trades around 30 you want to start buying a little, it is showing some nervousness in the market. When it hits 40 you are entering a correction and you want to buy more stocks.\n\n50 or 60 is a full fledged correction and a buy, buy, buy. The VIX has never traded and stayed at 50 more than a couple of weeks. It will come back down, which means stocks will go back up.\n\nA couple times it has traded over 70, 2009, March 2020. 1987?. This is a full fledged crash. People are throwing up, they think everyone is going out of business. Portfolio\u2019s are down 50% or 60%. This is where you back up the truck.

There are others.\n\nThere's the put-call ratio which measures how many puts(bets that the market will go down) versus calls(bet the market will go up) are being bought. Right now the put-call ratio is at levels we tend to see when the market gets attractive.\n\nThere is also the advance-decline ratio, which is a volume indicator. You want to see declining volume over advancing volume at a ratio of more than 10 to 1. We saw that this week on the NYSE.\n\nAlso you want to see irrational behavior- selling at all costs.  This is happening now and is measured  by how many stocks halt trading  because of volatility. As this number increases this tells you fear is setting in.\n\nSo while no one will tell you whether the sell off is over, you can see the writing on the wall. The end is getting closer every day.\n\nNow you know the signs. Next is to get a wish list of stocks together and dip your toes in the water.\n\nIt's  time to buy quality stocks.

My tank has gone through several reconstructions, right now the parameters are\n\nph: 6.6\u00b0 (it used to be 7 but has decreased, no co2, no carbon, just a normal planted tank with inert substrate)\n\nkh: 0-2\u00b0\n\ngh: 12\u00b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's weird is that my tap water's ph is at least 7.5\u00b0\n\ni don't have any wood in my tank, i use api water conditioner in a bucket and let the water chill before adding it to the tank. Temp is between 73-75F degrees. When i add water the ph does increase but it'll reduce right back down; i add water about 1000ml at a time so the ph doesn't drastically rise; about a 0.2\u00b0 rise.\n\nThe last reconstruction was almost month ago; it's definitely cycled now, the plants are growing well i use flora max substrate which states that it  slightly raises ph, before the reconstruction i had an active substrate with a ph at 6.4\u00b0. \n\nI added 5 cherries. 2 berried. Now only 1 is alive, there are a few shrimplets but i doubt they will survive. I do feed the shrimps pellets and i add cucumbers/wafers every few days; i also breed snails.\n\nWhat i'm asking is, are there any shrimp that can thrive in these parameters. I don't really like crystal red or black shrimp too much so any other suggestions is preferable."

It simplifies the understanding of trauma and provides exercises from a combination of EMDR, Somatic Experiencing, Parts Work, Mindfulnessness and more.\n* *Complex PTSD by Pete Walker*\n   * The narration sucks on this one but if you can get past it, the content is amazing. He explains the cause of trauma so accurately and it's symptoms, while also pointing you in the direction of what type of therapy to seek depending on your symptoms.\n* *Self-Therapy by Jay Earley*\n   * This book introduced me to the Parts Work method called Internal Family Systems (IFS) that kickstarted my healing journey.\n* *Scattered Minds by Gabor Mate MD*\n   * If you have had a freeze response like me you probably assumed you had ADHD your whole life. This book dives deep into his cutting edge research on how ADHD comes from childhood trauma.\n* *Healing Trauma by Peter A. Levine*\n   * This is the man who created Somatic Experiencing and this book is the ultimate introduction to the topic and also has some great exercises.\n\nFeel free to add your own recommendations below."

In his home country, it was a lot harder to carve out a living. So every day he was grateful to have a job, an income, people who needed him to help, and loved ones he could support in a safe environment. I always remembered his attitude from then on. I wasn't mentally and socially good at retail. But I am still proud of him and hope he is still rocking it as the best him he can be. \n\nI do also have a job that makes me feel joy now too.

                "body": "Feeling like I am the only one. \n\nI can't find anything about an AP doing that first. But a quiz says I am 40% anxious attachment and 35% fearful avoidant. Maybe that is it?\n\n\nWell here be my situation:\n\nI pulled the emergency no contact switch when I realized I was going to a ...\"dangerous place\" - to not say the triggering words -  \n\n\nI stayed longer cause he feared abandonment again. I knew I wouldn't stay (like with my abusive ex 6 years prior who did break up with me) if my current guy wouldn't work with me. But as he was busy I at least wanted to show him attachment theory to show we had hope.\n\nBut given he gave only a half committed response...mentioned he was busy the next few weekends...then went silent when I tried to work out ideas emmm. Yeah.\n\nSo I thought \"he may never let me in but he has the option to heal himself later with this stuff\" kind of a way to manipulate myself into the hero complex without knowing it at the time.\n\nIn a way he was still invested. Tried to give me small affections (bread crumb style) when I was too exhausted to chase or trying hard not to chase. Sadly due to my lack of relationship with my self it was like my love tank went from empty to 1-2% making me anxious I would run out any second.\n\nThen he would feel like the failure he believes he is. *sigh* If I had even somewhat of a secure dynamic with myself he could have practiced his fears.\n\nEr, well I was secure since he worked hard with my fears of being left. Even started to self sooth without his reassurance cause I knew he wouldn't  leave. Heh at least until I told him I was falling in love and wanted to know where our relationship was going since it had been a lot of months and I felt like I was going slow like he asked.\n\n\n\n\nSo yeah cue one month of instability between his fear of being close, and still caring in a way when I was too exhausted. When he reached out a bit I would fear the second I so much as touched his finger tip it would be ripped away. But I didn't want to reject his attempt either.\n\nWell when that turned into constantly feeling like I was being choked, vomit, and die...yeah. Eventually I a irl stress sent me over the edge. Yeah I got a bill way higher than expected and it all hit at once. I wanted to die and felt there was no hope of a at least semi happy life in any realm of my life. But I didn't wanna do that to my parents, friends and my sweet kitty.\n\n\nI didn't want to tell him at first. I didnt want my critical state to be seen as manipulation or to worse, experience silence like my abusive ex.\n\nI did tell him eventually with the mindset \"I will lose him anyway. Might as well ask how he wants me to exit his life, and if he wants me to leave the community we met in\" (long distance)\n\n\nWell, he did warn me earlier that day, he was angry from work and wanted to be left alone. He usually has a lot of emotional control. (Read: emotional and needs supression)\n\nHe was of course, triggered by me offering to leave him, but also as a book I have read says regarding APs like me: \"Any reaction, (even anger) is better than silence.\"\n\nSo at the time. ..his 'Dude chill out! I know you are going through so much but you are massively over reacting! Please calm down!' \nFollowed by apologies for not having composure, well...it felt like he was still invested. But I knew getting out of this mindset of not wanting to exist was not good. I tried to reach out to my best friend and parents too, even if it was hard. \n\n\n\nSo me going no contact. It was the next day. He was seeing friends and I was surprised to see him send me a photo. Later he responded to something light regarding a mutual friend. Between the previous day and this sudden response I tried to ask for a hug with the clear note that I was scared but wanted to be brave, given he clearly still wanted me in some way.\n\nWell, my logical brain fought the no response as long as it could. But anxiety brain tried to convince me that  the second I tried to be emotional he went silent yet again. Logic brain said he was busy then asleep.\n\nThen I realized even if logical brain is right (spoiler, it was) I can't keep doing this.\n\n\n\nI gave him a mutual friend to contact if he wanted to talk about the relationship. (An unfair expectation to a DA in retrospect, and one I wish I could apologize for. That is too risky and terrifying for them. Even with a secure partnerr they need patience and encouragement when they take the risk to be even slightly vulnerable. I couldn't give him that patience due to my insecure attachment)\n\nI went no contact, but half a day later he went to my best friend asking why I did no contact over such a small incident. He felt bad, like he was poison to me and I deserved better. (*sigh* dude you were better until the idea of letting me in for a relationship scared you.) \n\n\nI told him briefly it was about this whole thing. Also said, like mutual friend, best friend will now know not to tell me you reached out unless it was to talk about the relationship. As I can't control myself to wait for any response from him. It's like living on pins and needles \n\n\nWell, I am in therapy and no longer in the danger zone. Depression is less but still there. Oh yes, did I mention I have been successfully medicated for depression, anxiety, and panic disorder for like 5 years now? Without them I could hardly function irl. This was like being off my meds without going off my meds these last 2 weeks especially!\n\n\nSo, I heard that if you work on yourself and come from a place of having at least a more healthy self love, 6-8 weeks is a good time to reach out to a DA.\n\n\n\nIdk if I want it to be a break up or just...no contact until I heal. Unlike some DA's he did want me, but was too scared. And my being desparate didn't give him a safe space to grow himself.\n\nLike...he seems halfway between the DAs who actually care and would grow for their partner, and like the ones who just can't, or worse, like my ex, don't give a crap and see you as a toy. He also holds his exes from 8 and 9 years back (one short term, one long term) in his heart and blames himself for not being enough. He isn't a DA that doesn't care, just terrified of being hurt like his last ex did to him (yay trauma!) \n\n\nBut then I am like, can I get healthy enough - even if not perfect? -\n Is it worth trying when I could meet someone secure? But I am so bad with dating apps and irl. Only able to find men when not looking.\n\n Yeah I do love him for him (was afraid a bit this was cause I wanna save him from his self blame mindset. Realize this isn't the case) and want to be there but oi!!!\n\n\nIt's odd for a DA but not unheard of. And yeah despite me wondering if he is Fearful avoidant, it doesn't match up enough. Instead it seems to be my secondary type when I can't chase anymore.\n\n\n\nIdk if this a break up or me leaving to heal and try again.  If he shows no interest then yeah, move on. I can. But idk what to do if he wants to try. I will break up for good if he doesn't make progress (of course he can have bad days or take steps back. As long as he gets up and keeps trying baby steps forward) \n\n\n\nEven more frustrating... I can't find any case of a fellow anxious preoccupied going no contact unless the DA broke up and then kept shallow contact to keep the AP kind of there (with no commitment).\n\nOr it's just... I hear the AP always wants the DA back even with no contact. No mention of \"I may want to stay broken up\" \n\nAm I really that unusual?\n\nNo APs seem to do this."

THAT, my friends, is the prime example of a SD. Now grab the grandest most ornate over the top gown you can find and toss all your casual clothes into the nearest rut. Better yet, burn them. \n\n\nSOFT NATURAL - One word: Fridge. To hide the abomination that is your wide bulky frame, wear a potato sack at all times. Lmao peasant.\u00a0  \n\n\nFLAMBOYANT NATURAL - Has 2 subtypes, the incredible hulk and VS model. You also have to wear a potato sack, but like, long. If you're the VS model subtype you are allowed to decorate your sack.\n\n\nDRAMATIC CLASSIC - Boring brunette, stick to blazers - you can never go wrong with them. As an alternative you can copy all the current first lady's looks. Emphasis on CURRENT. DCs are boring therefore they are minimalist, and minimalism is modern, so to preserve that minimalist look you must keep up with the times.\n\n\nSOFT CLASSIC - Boring blonde. Wanna spice things up? Use Valak as inspiration. \n\n\nFLAMBOYANT GAMINE - Teenage boy. Peter pan collars and turtlenecks. 'Nuff said. \n\n\nSOFT GAMINE - The exact same proportions of your average 5 yr old, or that creepy Victorian doll in my family's ancestral home that for some strange reason isn't on its usual spot anymore. Hmm...maybe they moved it. Anyway, from this day on Annabelle is your only style icon. Sorry, I don't make the rules. \n\n\nTHEATRICAL ROMANTIC - Petite, curvy (but not fat ew), non existent shoulders and waist, femme fatale, show stopping, magnetic, alluring, gorgeous, sexy, appealing, perfect, A LITERAL GODDESS. It is required that you do not wear ANYTHING but a tight waist cinching belt to show off your sexae curves. \n\n\nROMANTIC - You are either Marilyn Monroe herself, or a moomin looking blob. If you identify more with the former, you are free to dress like a Disney princess, if you are closer to the latter in physical appearance try raiding the wardrobe of someone's grandmother.

Also, the \"f2p softcap\" and the \"whale softcap\" isn't really far apart and f2p can definitely catch up over time (although I wouldn't recommend being totally f2p).\n\nBasically, the value of your money doesn't have that much impact in this game for me to call it P2W since you aren't really \"winning\" anything.",

                "body": "I just \"beat\" the game (i.e. killed Ironbound and the Titan) and I've amassed several thoughts and points of concern during my time playing:\n\n# COMBAT\n\n* Dash attack animation of greatsword is a little clunky and doesn't flow well.\n* It'd be nice if there was a unique attack animation to follow a dodge. You can look at souls games as an example since the combat here seems to be similar.\n* Staff just feels worse to use in comparison to the demo. The damage on it also seems to be a slightly low and the AoE seems a little restrained.\n* Melee weapons just feel weak in general. There's little use for them over the bow.\n* I think we need some sort of lock-on.\n* The hitbox for the flame animation from enemy mages is just a little too big.\n* The special attack animation is too long, clunky, and just doesn't flow well.\n\n# GATHERING\n\n* It'd be nice to automatically pick up resources after cutting down a tree, or mining a rock, instead of having to manually pick it up afterwards.\n* Why does getting water with a water vessel completely drain the fountain for two seconds? Seems a little ridiculous and just annoying when trying to fill multiple vessels at once.\n* Could we have more water fountains? Or just let us fill the water vessel from any water source and then boil on a campfire?\n* Maybe show a tutorial pop-up for harvesting magic seeds? It took me a bit before I discovered that there were little purple things that could be harvested.\n\n# CRAFTING, COOKING, POTION-MAKING\n\n* We can make stone axe from inventory but need workbench to make stone pickaxe? Doesn't make sense.\n* Cooking takes much longer than in the demo. Wish that it was cut by at least 50%. Also cooking multiple recipes in succession would be nice.\n* Any plans to put iron weapons in soon...? Seems like iron is pretty under-utilized when you unlock the ability to start mining it. Like there's only a handful of recipes that use it.\n* The time to craft potions needs to be seriously reduced. Even if you're planning on releasing an upgraded version of the cauldron that has faster crafting times, 5 minutes to craft a potion is way too long especially when you ask for 10 energy pots to make the deconstructor.\n* Why does the water vessel go away when it's used...? That literally makes no sense. Do your cups magically disappear once you drink out of them?\n* There's little to no point in being able to que item crafting in the garden bed if you have to manually take the essence when it's done before the next item starts to craft. Same goes for crafting potions from the pot.\n\n# BUILDING\n\n* Why does a workbench need to be placed on a foundation? It just seems like something ripped from Valheim that doesn't really belong in this game (in my opinion at least).\n* Having to click RMB to exit the building UI is unintuitive. Just let us click Q again to exit out.\n* Removing pieces is also a little unintuitive since we need to go to the red hammer to destroy things. If you free up the RMB button, you can just use that as a separate input to remove pieces. This is what Conan Exiles does at least.\n* For some reason, there's no option to make makeshift stairs. Not sure if this was intentional or just forgotten?\n* Like gathering resources, we should be able to automatically pick up the parts when we destroy a building piece. It's annoying to have to destroy misplaced pieces and then exit the building interface to pick up the sticks.\n* Building spots are awkward. There are very little obvious spots to build a house (i.e. flat spots located away from enemy spawn points). In fact, the whole building approach to this game is a little off and doesn't seem fully integrated. It definitely seems like it's something added as an afterthought which is weird considering that building has been apart of the game since the very beginning in 2019.\n\n# INTERFACE, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT\n\n* Need item sorting in both inventory and storage (by weight, name, type, etc.)\n* Add in the option of right-clicking an item in your inventory to automatically assign to the hotbar.\n* I'd prefer an equipment U.I. that doesn't show equipped gear in the inventory. It helps de-clutter things.\n* Add option to compare armor/weapons to current equipped armor/weapon.\n\n# EXPLORATION\n\n* Burning vines is weird now. Like many other things, I don't know why you changed this from the demo. There was a nice flame animation that showed them burning and they weren't as much of a pain to get through.\n* The Return Stone...is weird. Like many things in this game, it's clear that this was Dark Souls inspired. However, the difference is that souls in Dark Souls are MUCH more abundant in whereas flame in this game is not. There's the fact that you can easily grind souls whereas grinding flame in this game is a nightmare at the moment. It would make more sense for you to just put a 30-minute cooldown on it and maybe some sort of small debuff.\n* It'd be nice if there was some sort of collection log to track everything that you've done like collecting chests, the totem things, and the challenges. It'd also be nice to have a journal to check what quests we've done as well as re-read the journal pages that we find.\n* It'd be nice to have an exploration % of map shown.\n* We need some sort of legend for the icons on the map. Or add a description/title when you hover over each icon.\n* Allow flight on Cradle of Keepers. The only reason that I see why you don't allow this is because you want players to climb the mountain. An easy fix is to somehow MAKE players climb the mountain before leaving Cradle of Keepers. Maybe move one of the bosses, or add another boss up there? Or place an NPC up there that ties in with learning flight? After the player climbs the mountain, there's no reason to not allow them to fly on Cradle of Keepers in my opinion.\n* While I can somewhat understand Cradle of Keepers, the no-fly zones in the Broken Valley seem a bit arbitrary and not necessary in my opinion. If you don't want players to fly in boss zones, then just disable flying during boss fights.\n* Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems like there's only two teleporters in Broken Valley? I feel like there should at least be three.\n* Rewards from boss chests are kind of crap. Got two bone swords from Broken Valley and a stone sword in Cradle of Keepers. You might as well just give some stone and sticks.\n\n# MISC.\n\n* The weapon weight is a little too much in my opinion. I would lower it by at least 25%. Like I'm not sure in what world you guys think that a wooden bow should weigh 24 lbs or kg or whatever weight metric you're using.\n* You probably should also increase the max starting weight. It's just hard to really try to gather to build a house when you're over-encumbered after chopping like 4 or 5 trees.\n* For some reason, masks don't have weight? Black bracelets also have no weight?\n* I feel like flame essence should give more flame when consumed. It's pretty negligible right now and it feels bad to receive flame essence as a reward from chests or quests.\n* Toggle option to hide backpack and helmet.\n* Maybe create a better falling animation...? It's kind of weird for someone to panic so much when falling when they can fly.\n* There are two different items named \"flame essence.\" One is blue and one is orange-ish. I'm assuming that the orange one is a higher tier version, but it'd be nice it had some sort of modified name to differentiate itself.\n* Why does Cursed Warrior Mask cost 500 coins while Bonehead Mask costs 300 coins? They offer the same defense and same amount of resistance (bleeding and poison respectively).\n* I think that the cost of the frozen flames for the second ring of perks/abilities is too high. It probably should be two per ability which leaves you room to make the third ring cost 3 flames per ability.\n* There's a bit of texture clipping when you equip the backpack.\n* Why do you put away the torch when you start running...? Literally the whole point of having a torch is having it out.\n* Perk tree: half is good, half is not. Not the best feedback, but there's a lot to talk about that warrants a separate post just about the perk tree. Overall, I'm not a huge fan of unlocking perks relating to being well-rested and full after eating. I feel like there should be a default buff for these things and maybe perks that increase that buff.\n* Blueprints are just odd. I don't understand why you need to buy the blueprints for helmets especially when masks are so much more powerful.\n\n\\----\n\nSidenote: not sure if Ironbound was nerfed due to the mass complaints, but I thought he was fine. He's very clearly a boss that you have to fight later on after upgrading your gear and so on. It also helps to bring posion res items and health pots.\n\nOverall, I actually enjoyed my time playing through what's been released so far. One big general statement that I'll say that the game becomes a LOT more fun after unlocking flight in the Broken Valley, however Cradle of Keepers is a bit of a slog in my opinion. Not sure how to remedy this other than really focusing on fast-tracking the player through CoK. It also might help to allow the player to unlock flight on Cradle of Keepers.\n\nEDIT: Spelling, grammar, and added a few things that I forgot."

For instance, there's a moment in the new questline where we straight up mine a rock, but we don't do it with an actual pickaxe. I feel like it was a bit of a wasted opportunity to show new players how to equip life tools and such.\n\nOverall, I REALLY hope that this is the last time that they revamp the main storyline. So far it looks promising and I'm curious on how they'll do the rest -- especially Valencia II, why the fuck does this questline still exist?"

                "body": "I've been seeing a lot of people completely siding with John beating the shit of Remi and co., and it kind of saddens me because I don't think this is what the author was trying to convey in the slightest. So, I'm going to share my reasoning why John isn't someone that we, the readers, should be supporting at this point in the story. \n\nFirst of all, **his goal:** **To destroy the hierarchy.** \n\nSimple.\n\n**His reasoning?** **Low-tiers are oppressed by high-tiers and treated inhumanely.**\n\nOk, fair enough.\n\n**His methodology? To beat the shit out of every Royal in order to show that their power isn't absolute.**\n\nOk, let's unpack that one.\n\nJohn's whole stated purpose to bringing down the hierarchy is to establish order between the lower-tiers and the high-tiers. Some actual examples in history of this kind of thing occurring would be the French Revolution and the Bolshevik/Russian Revolution. However, unlike in those cases, John isn't a populist. Remember when Sera was talking to the low-tiers, and they said that they got some weird vibes from John? Yeah, that's because John never actually associated himself with the low-tiers, yet he's acting like he's fighting for them. If he TRULY believed that low-tiers and high-tiers should be treated equally, he would've banded the low-tiers together to fight against the high-tiers. However, instead, he's doing it all by himself. Why? Because Arlo personally messed with John, and high-tiers messed with Sera -- his best friend.\n\nI mean, think about it, if John was TRULY being empathetic to low-tiers and their suffering, he would've done something AGES ago. That's the whole reason his dad wrote Unordinary if anyone even remembers that. Yet, John went on his merry way and tried to keep his head low. It's only when the \"system\" affected him personally that he got involved. \n\nFurthermore, let's imagine what's going to happen when, or if, John actually succeeds. The high-tiers are going to be stripped of status, and they're going to be on \"equal grounds\" with the low-tiers. And, if the high-tiers act out and try to beat up the low-tiers? Well, John is likely going to beat the shit out of them to put them back into place because he's the strongest. And what's going to happen when John leaves? Well, the old hierarchy will come back. In other words, it's going to be the exact repeat of what Remi's brother tried to do except that while John is in power, he will be the only \"Royal\" with any say (i.e. a dictator). \n\nSo, taking into consideration all the points I made above, John's actual goal is this:\n\n**To destroy the hierarchy and replace it with a new one where he's the only one at the top.**\n\nHis actual reasoning:\n\n**Because his life was personally messed with, and he wants revenge.**\n\nHis methodology:\n\n**To beat the shit out of every Royal to show that their power isn't absolute but HIS is.** \n\nLet's get real with ourselves. In just about ANY other story, John would be an antagonist.  His crusade is 100% self-serving, and it's not to the benefit of anyone but himself. He criticizes the system for prioritizing power above all else, but by oppressing everyone with his power, he's actually serving the system more than anyone."

One which she found complementary to her old protestant faith, as it both included keeping the covenant of the Old and New Testament and the commandments. Something that really resonated with her on an intellectual and spiritual -level, as she purported. \n\nShe didn\u2019t frequent the synagogue, as it was deemed unnecessary by her, instead she was part of a community where they took turns to hold services in one of their houses. She described it as a \u2018regular\u2019 service, as they would have done in a \u2018regular\u2019 synagogue, but somewhat more lighthearted. \n\nHere\u2019s where my memory is fading;\n\nIf I remember correctly: In the home services; they did readings from the Torah/Tanakh?, upon which they all later discussed a particular passage, kind of as an afterthought. \n\nShe added the importance of the teachings of Yeshua Ben Yosef (Jesus Christ) as well, but it wasn\u2019t the \u2018be all end all\u2019 to her faith. I think, she deemed Jesus as nothing more than a prophet/messenger, not sure. Yahweh was the God to her. \n\n- Well, that\u2019s it. If you need more details, I will try my best to recollect, but so far this all I can remember."

His mom literally physically moved out and left, so why did Shawn accuse his dad of leaving instead? \n\nNo spoilers please - I just thought this was supposed to explain his strained relationship with his dad at this point and it just left me more confused."

I tried introducing it to him slowly by putting some of the new litter mixed in with his old litter and he got so mad that he pooped in my tub. Besides that, I\u2019ve tried tons of different clay litters, but they\u2019re all so dusty and smelly that they stink up the whole apartment. \n\nUnfortunately it appears that my cat refuses to use anything except clay litter in a regular litter box... so what litter can anyone recommend that truly, honestly doesn\u2019t smell & isn\u2019t dusty? \n\nAt this point I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s extra money. The litter box is in a common area in my tiny apt and I just can\u2019t take the obvious smell anymore. Even when I scoop everyday the dust gets everywhere.

                "body": "It might not be super helpful, but I think all of your scenarii are good. \nI'd say it depends a lot on the personalities of your individual Wardens, because for example, maybe even if they're messed up, Aeducan is very composed and has a natural leadership, making people rely on them naturally? Maybe Brosca actually really loves to lead after a life being the underdog and takes over naturally?\n\nTbh, I especially like your A and B, and I think they're actually not mutually exclusive. Maybe Brosca is at least a temporary leader. Like, people usually call on Aeducan, but Brosca is the go-to when shit hits the fan, due to them being more pragmatic and no-bs with their background?\n\nFor reference, in my own HC, Mahariel is the one leading, because he's the one who literally has no ties left. His clan is somewhere he doesn't know, but he likely wasn't born where his origin took place and maybe wouldn't even remember the way due to being feverish while quiting the forest. I also HC that due to being tainted before the Joining, he has a stronger call from the Blight than other, and his best chance to help Tamlen is to follow the Blight. He finds a lot of comfort in still having a nomadic life, honouring Dalish rituals and following the Vir Assan (especially the \"do not falter\" part). He's also the least unhinged of all the other Wardens, so it happens naturally.\nBeside, after seeing the fate of Tamlen, he gets a closure that others do not have.\n\nFor context as to why the rest of my Wardens aren't really leading :\n\ud83d\udd38 Aeducan was actually content being passively part of the royalty without ever wanting to rule (despite people thinking she's be a better ruler than her brothers, due to her humility and diplomacy, which is why Bhelen still set her up). And after being quite bullied by Trian, she still has a lot to unpack to just lead her own life, so she doesn't think she's fit to lead others just yet. It's also just weird to her to build a home when she always had one already there before. So now the Wardens are her home, but that's it.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Brosca...still figuring out how they fit in, but so far they're an unhinged inventor not caring much about life outside of what they can build. They just care enough about Rica to protect her a little, but yeah, the poor girl is essentially shouldering the whole family. Brosca just reluctantly participate in the Carta to get the materials for their next invention and begrudgingly give some money for the family. They're content working for the Wardens, making them new weapons etc and that's about it. They give the rest of the party the creeps, nobody would follow them lol\n\n\n\ud83d\udd38Surana is at first more invested in the Chantry than the Warden until she has a mental breakdown around the Landsmeet. She doesn't become a Warden, but she helps Mahariel to manage the Keep a lot post Origin, even if they have a rivalry-path kind of relationship. The way the Circle treated Jowan gives her a lot of food for thoughts. She's actually always pro-Jowan no matter the topic and is more loyal to him than anything or anyone. And since I HC Jowan as a Warden, she just follows.\nShe's also really super obnoxious and brainwashed by the Chantry for a long time (the Jowan thing at the Circle made her question it for the first time ever) and while she's lovey-dovey with Alistair, most people legit can't stand her (she calls Leliana an heretic at first, clashes with Wynne about Jowan and Mahariel and the next character really side against her). Essentially a hard lesson she has to learn is that \"because I said so\" isn't enough to lead people.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd38I have an Avvar character who's just essentially like \"haha kill good\" (at least outwardly) and think it's helping the clan that they fight the Blight. They also have really bad self-esteem and see themselves as too dumb and uncultured to be a leader (their whole arc is about learning to deconstruct these beliefs). But they're not very committed to the Wardens, so they leave with Morrigan post-origin and Mahariel try to cut them as much slack as possible (they're also related in my HC, so sibs solidarity haha). The rest of the party see them as kinda immature (when that's just a persona) and too self-interest and fickle to trust. They also scare them a bit because they're the tallest and bulkiest party member after Shale and Sten. Really, they just aren't born leader and are fine with it.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd38Tabris sees it as a job. They get money from it with the looting etc that they bring back to their Alienage and that's about it, killing things on the way isn't a problem. The Wardens could be the Carta that it'd be the same, except the Wardens also have a worldwide legal authority that protect them when they commit crimes. The Wardens see them as an asset too, so they let them visit their family at times. A bit of an outcast among the party, with no real desire to socialise anymore than you would with your coworkers. They take the Blight seriously, like a job to tackle (like Sten and Morrigan) and as such people don't really rely on them for anything other than fighting.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Cousland is associating the Wardens with the traumas of losing his family. He's there, but not too crazy about it and just helps with the political bs. He's happy with Gilmore (I accepted this mod adding him in the party as canon a long time ago lol), is happy to sometimes help administrating at Hunter's Fell and doesn't make a fuss.  Actually, fr he's a lot like Nathaniel, which drives them both crazy but they eventually become best buddies. But yeah, essentially he would've led before the betrayal of old Howe, but it broke him too much to really be invested in anything else than keeping people safe after that. People would tend to see him as a natural leader, but he's really for most part an empty shell and gets even a bit defensive when people rely on them or remind him of his titles. \nHe even has issues with Fergus later on, because he refuse to believe he's alive due to ptsd and Fergus barely recognise his character anymore.\n\n\nSo yeah, Mahariel, while a mess of anxiety not too found of leading is the most invested in the Wardens, is easy to follow for most and doesn't have a life anywhere else anymore, outside of Arlathven. He's resilient about it being a closed chapter of his life after Tamlen's fate is discovered and The Gauntlet. It takes more time to Surana, but eventually she gets there too around DA2 and they share more responsibilities.\nHe's also fairly easy to get along with, a lot like Purple Hawke but more collective-oriented and cares a lot about others. The main beef people would've with him would be that he defends marginalized groups with his life (he is very supportive of Velanna and An!ders post DA2, especially EDIT : getting annoyed at the modbot always remiving my posts when I mention the aforementioned mage of a game from +10y ago, with no spoiler whatsoever about what he does) and his goofiness and his bits of naivety and indecisiveness making him look a bit immature at time, yet he's able to focus on the mission more than Alistair and gets better with time. But yeah, sometimes you see this group and you wonder if Sten taking over at Haven wouldn't have been better overall lol\n\nSo that's what I meant by \"depends on your characters\". Many factors influence how they lead, are willing to and how much people would follow them, beside their origins.",

I really tried, but there's a point of pushing past your limits where you're just mentally gone for both your partner and yourself and it takes a lot of time to reconstruct from the damages.\n\nSo yeah, I know what people think of dumpers here, as if it's a different specie than dumpees and we can't get messed up by a relationship but honestly even my abusive father didn't mess me up that much. So no chance I'm ever trying anything again with him and no, it couldn't have been saved. Trying to salvage the unsalvageable sometimes is just self-sabotage/self-harm.",

Very much a Justice = Themis wau to deal with it and Judgement = Nemesis way to deal with it, when it comes to results of actions and accountability.\n If I'm understanding well, for you it has a more fatalistic meaning, that is showing up DURING the situation and not after or as a warning (especially since warning would imply you can change it, whereas in your case, if I'm getting you right, it's more unmovable and just something you can do your best to tango with)?",

But those parts are made of rubber, so I'm not sure what's going to work. I thought of maybe just using hot glue, but I don't know if I could smooth it out properly. Cosclay looks like it would be great, but I need to use something that air dries because I can't stick this guy in the oven with all the synthetic fur.

In the Toby McGuire movies and the Andrew Garfield movies, we saw this play out classically. In Into the Spiderverse, we saw how this was a little different with each character. Gwen's equivalent was losing her version of Peter, Penelope lost her father, and of course for Miles Morales it was his uncle Aaron. Now of course, in the MCU, the uncle Ben storyline is still canon, but we don't see it play out the same way, and it doesn't seem to quite affect him as dramatically. So it always felt to me that Tom Holland's spiderman story hit a little different than all the rest because of that. Except, I kinda just had this realization hit... *Tony Stark was his uncle Ben*. Thoughts and feelings?"

I really like a lot of individual songs (mostly from miscellaneous anime openings) but I'd really like to find like one really good band to get into as well. As a reference point, Loop by Heidi is definitely one of my favorites in the genre. Like I said beyond anime themes I don't know much. Not necessarily looking for exclusively the typical hard rock style either, just something in that realm. Thank you!"

When you don't, it's panic.\n\nAnd let's be real; if FNaF 1 was in real life, you could easily just camp the hallways or just listen to footsteps. They're robots, can't control their loudness. Shut the doors easily when you hear them close. Or you could just maybe hide in the bathrooms, and maybe discover the false wall that leads into a saferoom and hide in that room. It's not that animatronics can enter inside, hehe?\n\nIf FNaF 2 was in real life, no matter how chaotic it seemed in game, you could just have the mask on the entire night, flashlighting and have the camera for the puppet at the same time. Hiding would be a little less doable, as the puppet would probably find you after music box runs out.\n\nBut FNaF 3, it's something way different. There is no doors to block. Only vents that you can seal one at the time. There is no mask to fool threats. Only audio. And for audio you need to go through the cameras, look for Springtrap, but also be aware of surroundings outside of camera. FNaF 3 would truely be terrifying in real life. You are not going against a robot that you can easily fool. You're going full on against a once serial killer possessing its vessel and can and will beat you with experience. Hiding inside the office is not a choice either, he is human, he knows where a person would hide. Your best bet is to leave the door next to your office.\n\nAs for Springtrap himself:\n\nSpringtrap is literally a godly level of design. Despite Scott being bad at modeling humans, he nailed Springtrap.\n\nThe other animatronics were too robotic. They just looked, like animatronics. Robots. And even when they talk, they have robotic voices. Also the single animalistic blank stare is not that scary.\n\nSpringtrap on the other hand, appears to be very alive. Permanently grinning. That smile of the Springtrap suit across the window and some of the cameras are very eerie. His character blending in the dark corners of cameras definitely shows that he is most aware out of all of them. The black and white dead eyes that show this thing is repossessing itself. Also the fact that he is a serial killer repossessing his vessel but in the suit is ten times scarier than realising that FNaF 1 and 2 animatronics are possessed by murdered children. That's more sad and tragic than anything. But William possessing his corpse inside Springtrap, for the sole purpose of never giving up and trying to cause as much chaos is evil.",

You will hear when they get close, then close the door. Or go hide in the bathroom, after all they don't go there because the office makes noise. And maybe discover that there is a saferoom you can hide in. It's not that animatronics can go there, hehe? Also you can turn of the damn fan and waste less power.\n\nFNaF 2: As chaotic it seems, the game limits your defense. You could easily have a mask on while using the camera to wind up. And easily flashlight Foxy. As for hiding, it's less doable, as the Puppet will probably find you. Or even easier, wear a mask and just exit the pizzeria. The Puppet probably can't leave the place.\n\nFNaF 3: There is a door outside your office. Easy. \nOkay.... Assuming you have to leave at the other door, well: Wait for Springtrap to enter a vent that's quite long. Once he does, run through the halls.\n\nFNaF 4: Sleep with the lights on, of course. If your father hates you and turns off lights for the entire house, just take medications. They're nightmares. If they are somehow real, well it's a good time to flip off your dad.\n\nFNaF SL: Take an elevator back.\n\nFFPS: Why do you have to complete tasks before burning it all down? If you have all of them here, just pull the trigger and go sky high. Legit don't care if people are above me and it's still daytime, kill the animatronics. Or if you don't want to do that, that is, you prefer not dying, then... Don't. Come. At. All.\n\nEdit 1: Honorable mentions (by u/overactivemango): Don't take the job in the first place."

What did he do there? Wait? FOR 30 YEARS? Even the most stubborn minds wouldn't wait out that long. I guess Afton is just something else.\n\nI don't even believe in particular that Afton dies in that suit, and repossess his vessel when he gets discovered in FNaF 3. He was definitely alive and conscious throughout the entire springlock failure and afterwards. He had remnant.\n\nWas the saferoom he got springlocked in sealed? Sure, phone calls say they were, but there is a little problem. Phone guy narrates through them. So he must be alive when that happened. Phone guy died in FNaF 1 which probably happened before William got springlocked. So, was that safe room ever sealed again? By who? It probably was, because Phone dude mentions there is a boarded up room.\n\nIf it was, then William was definitely trapped in that room with no escape until someone breaks him out. All he could do is walk circles or bang around, but that wouldn't help.\n\nIf it wasn't, then William could've roamed around the FNaF 1 location. It would be possible, he does move by the time FNaF 3 comes. But that alternative is on thin glass, as I've already said that Phone Dude mentions in Night 1 that there is a boarded up room and on Night 2 he says that they would a real animatronic.\n\nAnd point being said, maybe William didn't get springlocked in 1993. Maybe he was springlocked far later. The flesh in the suit doesn't look dried off enough to imply he was rotting there for 30 years. Unless remnant has some kind of healing properties, which I don't even wanna get to know how that would work."

It looks spriitual, it comes from a rich and ancient culture so it must be profound, and it gives us a nice and vague goal, restoring the \"\"\"balance\"\"\" of whatever we're writing.\n\nExcept that's not what's happening.\n\nA single glance at the Wikipedia page for [Yin and Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang) shows us that it's about:\n\n>\\[...\\] how obviously opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary,  interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they  may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another.\n\nIt represents opposing concepts, but requires both of them. Night and Day, hot and cold, wet and dry. There is a dualism, but it's not judging.\n\nEnter the Legend of Korra, Season 2. We're introduced to the Two Kite-Shaped Spirits Raava and Vaatu. They're explicitely coded to invoke Yin-Yang imagery, and their endless battle is supposed to be the balance of the world. Except one is the nice friendy Jesus, and the other is evil bad satan man. If the former wins, everyone is happy and lives, and if the latter wins, everything goes to shit. The proposed Balance is then to lock the bad one away for eternity. For a series that has previously excelled at spiritualism, this is a slap to the face.\n\nWe see this occasionally, both in western and other media, from Video Games to movies. Star Wars 8 did it, Metroid Prime 2 did it, Prince of Persia (2009) did it. And it wouldn't be that weird if it didn't explicitely invoke the concept of \"Balance\", only to completely shit on it.\n\nIt's a shorthand that's used to add the *pretense* of depth, when it could just as easily be used to actually add depth to a work."

It's never used for anything, and in the later levels enemies are even immune to it. A huge load of wasted potential. The thing is, I feel like I played every significant time-themed game already.  \n**Singularity** was fun but short-lived. Had fun idea but felt like it always limited your time powers. I played a demo of **Timeshift** once and you really only had a second of rewind power to do anything at all, which was really bad. **F.E.A.R.** at least had the slowdown mechanic, but that was also limited. **Dishonored** also had a time thing going, but that too felt gimmicky and very limited, because the game wasn't balanced around excessive use of it. Did **Dishonored 2** fix that?  \n**Chrono Trigger** and **Radiant Historia** are classics, but only feature large scale time travel. **Ghost Trick** too was a blast, loved the things it did, but played it already, and time is really just the setup, not a gameplay element.  \n**Braid** was really cool, and used it's mechanics a lot to get into some really tricky puzzles. Loved the style and aesthetic, and the **Prince of Persia**-esque rewind mechanic. On the other hand, I kinda really hated **Gateways**, because the time recording loops got far too complicated to be fun.  \n**Life is Strange**, of course, was a wild ride, but I never felt like it added up to a whole like the individual episodes promised, and the ending was bull.  \nEven some games with light time manipulation elements, like **SuperHot** and **Undertale**, those were neat, and the backwards narrative of **To The Moon** really blew me away, even if it's technically not time travel.\n\nAny more games specifically using cool time mechanics? Specifically time-bendy puzzle or combat elements that aren't completely neutered by ammo or magic meters? Something that feels integral to the gameplay, rather than a glorified ice beam? Not just a normal game that has a time-stop unlockable skill at the very end. Many games seem to do the simple \"two versions of the same map in different time periods\" stuff, but that has to have something unique to be worth anything, or it might just be two parallel worlds.\n\nSorry for the long post.

Some tests may not specify. Two that give you all your types are the Truity and Your Enneagram Coach tests. You can determine your wing and tritype. So if you\u2019re a 9 you will have a 8 or 1 wing. (1 because it starts over again to 1 because 9 is last.) If 3 you have a 4 or 5 wing, if 7 a 6 or 8 wing, etc. It\u2019s which is highest that\u2019s directly adjacent. Some have a strong wing some not. Some say it\u2019s possible to switch between wings and some say it\u2019s possible to not have one. I think everyone has one, you can\u2019t switch and some are strong, standard, or weak as far as influence. Also whether or not one\u2019s wing is also in ones tritype. So me for example 4w5 458 the 5 is my wing and also the second largest type/ influence I have out of everything. So its very strong. Someone else may have there wing be 5th all together so not all that much of a factor. Next is the Triads. There are several representing different things. First and foremost is the Centers of Intelligence. Type 2, 3, and 4, are the Heart Triad, 5,6,and ,7 are the Head Triad, and 8,9, and 1 are the Gut or instinct Triad. So in tritype you have one trifix (dominant type or influence) from each center. So me again 458 I\u2019m  4 heart the 5 head then 8 gut. And in that order. So I can\u2019t be a 783 or any combination where more than one of a Triad is in the sane tritype. The type you are, like I\u2019m a 4, is always your first trifix. So I\u2019d recommend taking those two tests I listed and that\u2019s a great place to start. As well as revisiting the trauma of each type. Let me know how it goes!",

I can talk with everyone no matter what their intelligence is if i match with them is another thing but i value information more than anything. \n\nBut what i notice is that people treat me different when i tell them i am gifted they dont believe it and or try to test it and think i am some narcissistic person that wants to be smart. \n\nSometimes because of all these self reflections in society i dont believe im gifted either and i must be a fraud. Sometimes it fucks with my head so much.\n\nBut it is just because real life tells more than information from a test and if other people seem to react on that its a natural realisation that there are question marks coming up. Also peoples expectations are way higher and this makes me massively insecure. \n\nEspecially when it comes to some punctuation and grammar i seem to make some mistakes here and there because i am a very visionair thinker and find it hard to translate exactly what i see. i focus to much on that instead of detail in scripture. \n\nAlso before i got my test result i had my own personal view on intelligent people and had way to high ideas about them which in reality are pretty similar to my own what i hear from other people. \n\nThis view is pretty interesting is like self critical behaviour that shows a false reality.",

I figured out very recently for 95% sure that i am gifted and i am now getting tested for it. \n\nThe thing is i dont care about the whole label gifted and the IQ score but i dont know if it is the right thing to do. I just need help with how to use it properly.\n\nI realise from people i have to tell i am gifted or institutions that they fuck around with it saying it shouldn\u2019t be a problem, are you sure you dont come over to me as a genius? why would you like to know it doesn\u2019t add any value or the smart people we had in the company work hard and have no complains at all, if you are gifted you don\u2019t need help you know how to figure it out yourself or have no idea what you talk about and see you as an obstacle. Not to say that i am very open about it not at all but when problems arise that i have to explain my way of thinking i see they don\u2019t understand and then sometimes i have to say it.\n\nIm so tiered of proving myself over and over again and self sabotaging myself. And having to adjust so much.\n\nAt this point i feel delusional but i am not i know it deep inside i heard it from many other people before in the past and just swept it under the carpet me gifted!?? Pfft i have a F for mathematics and absolutely hated school. For a reason.. i was bored as hell and misunderstood and became rebellious.\n\nI have been through a whole list of psychologists and psychiatrists and they actually didn\u2019t help at all. It felt more like a punishment from misunderstanding and the half hours they have per two weeks is to short to really make them understand even if i notch it down it gets misunderstood. I have been called lazy, arrogant, etc and always leads to going back to work solves everything\u2026 im the absolute opposite and thats the whole reason why i am in this situation. \n\nI honestly dont know anymore and am confused and had to rant about this.

And many narcissists mistake themselves for being gifted and HSP. \n\nMost narcissistic people have a form of covert narcissism and empathic narcissism in combination with feeling very sensitive for themselves and because they create all these frameworks to use in day to day life can live therefor in a delusion it can make them think they are highly intelligent or gifted or different. This can also show in body dysphoria and personality issues.\n\nThey might feel strong empathy for others and have strong moral compass and show controlled compassion and think in ways to push this forward in every way possible might suffer from OCD kind of symptoms and dysphoria and therefor feel miss fits and have a hard time with adapting in society. \n\nThey can even have depression and anxiety. Being busy with topics to feed their frameworks but is most of the time very subjective and biased. Because they use all this info to get something out of it for themselves they can be pretty educated on some topics but will show manipulation and aggressive behaviour in return when their bubble bursts. \n\nWhat is seen pretty often is that these narcissists find groups to feed each other and find compassion. most of the time it also drags real empathic people that wants to help them and other narcissists who support them.\n\nThere are \u201cgifted\u201d narcissists who might say that giftedness is something spiritual and connected to higher dimension\u2019s, they also go in discussions a lot to prove themselves how smart they are and unique. And react with a lot of information in perfect grammar and punctuation that actually doesn\u2019t say much to prove their point. \n\nThey talk a lot in labels and self diagnoses and rare disorders, will fact check on everything and ask for scientific proof even if there might not be a study for it, while its just commons sense.\n\nFor sure there might be gifted people with narcissism but the opposite is more common."

Neither the *atha-* stem nor the *-ssa* suffix mean anything by themselves in Remian.  Some other words in this vein are **balissa** /ba'lis\u0250/ \"alchemical mixture\" (from Shel. *balissa* \u2039 *bale\u0301ar* 'mix, combine'), **bo\u0304ssa** /bo:s\u0250/ \"rank 9 mage\" (from Shel. *bo\u0301ssa*, more literally \"superiority, dominance\" \u2039 *bo\u0301ar* \"be above, be better than\"), **halassa** /ha'las\u0250/ \"inflation, price hike\" (from Shel. *halassa* \u2039 *halar* \"rise, raise\"), **kanissa** /ka'nis\u0250/ \"meditation\" (from Shel. *kanissa* \u2039 *kanir* \"ponder, meditate\" [itself a borrowing from Hembedrian *qan* \"think\"]), etc.\n\nFrom Hembedrian there's **kalmatu** /kal'mad\u026f/ \"pepper\" \u2039 *kal-* \"be hot\" + *matu* \"pepper\", **laghena** /la'\u0263\u025bn\u0250/ \"the humanities, the fine arts\" \u2039 *lak-* \"study\" + *g\u0301en* \"four\", i.e. \"four studies\" (=literature, philosophy, rhetoric, and music; visual art was tacked on later), **mataki** /ma'dagi/ \"frequency\" \u2039 *ma-* marks the continuative mood + *taki* \"action, doing\", literally \"continue to do\".  Hembedrian words are often borrowed twice or three times removed, and tend to get phonetically mangled:  **chersa** /'t\u0255\u025brs\u0250/ \"plot of a story\" comes ultimately from Hemb. *ak-* \"anti-, dis-, counter-\" + *wis-* \"wrap\", and **zhamba** /'\u0292amb\u0250/ \"bad omen\" comes ultimately from Hemb. *ya\u0294enava* \u2039 *ya\u0294* \"god\" + *nava* \"tells\".\n\nAs for *peninsula*, Remian has two native monomorphemic words: **ky\u0304m** /ky:m/ and **ke\u0304dh** /ke\u0291/, which differ chiefly in thickness.  A **ke\u0304dh** is a peninsula connected to the mainland only by an isthmus; a **ky\u0304m** is simply a \"finger\" jutting out from the continent.",

                "body": "I'm writing a story in which the following scenario is the case:\n\n1. The main character's (MC's) birth mom dies when he's 9, and Dad remarries when he's 12.  Stepmom brings a stepbrother into the picture, age 8 at time of remarriage.\n\n2. Dad and stepmom later go through a nasty breakup and divorce when he's 15-16 and the stepbrother is 11-12.  \n\n3. Stepmom wants full custody of *both* kids.  Dad at least wants joint custody, and preferably full custody, of his own.\n\n4. Both kids want their respective biological parent to have full custody of them.  If the MC MUST go with his stepmom, he at least wants to retain his last name.\n\n5. There is no abuse, or at least no *physical* abuse, going on here by any party.  CPS has never been called.\n\n6. If it matters: the state is Kansas, the time period of the divorce is the late 1990s, and the house they are living in was bought during Dad's original marriage (when the MC was born).\n\nFrom what I can tell from searching here, there *is* some consideration paid to the teen's wishes in these hearings, but I'm not sure how much it matters.  My questions:\n\n- Given the above, how likely is it that the MC gets everything he wants?  Conversely, how likely is it that the stepmom gets everything she wants?\n- Would this change at all if the reason for divorce was infidelity on Dad's part?\n- Would this change at all if the MC clams up before the judge?"

Remian is a mostly a-posteriori, mostly Germanic language, which is a double-edged sword:  it means I start with a meatier lexicon and have more options (synonyms, even!)... but it also means I can't \"cheat\" by just fiating a rhyme into existence.  (I mean, I *can*; almost all of its *borrowings* are a-priori, but Remian is a somewhat reluctant borrower.\n\nRemian is more trochaic than English, at least in affirmative sentences which all of these are; the final \"masculine\" rhymes don't fit as well.  I included (in parentheses) in the IPA how a singer would most likely *actually* pronounce them in the context of the song.  [\u02c8\u0261\u026b\u0251b\u0268s] is prosaic; [\u0261\u026b\u0251\u02c8bis] is poetically elegant.  However, I did have some wiggle room in that the first three syllables of each line are more or less equally stressed in the song.\n\nThe second line is a much looser translation, with the prosody forcing my hand.  The English structure is four iambs, and the most direct translations of \"hope,\" \"frail,\" \"hard,\" and \"kill\" would be trochaic disyllables.  No room to maneuver without changing the structure.\n\nThe hardest part, though, was probably the third line.  I considered a more direct translation **ashe\u0304len gis** \"you will achieve\", which matches meaning and fits the prosody, but on reading the Wikipedia article about the song, I realized that they changed the English lyrics from \"you can do miracles\" to \"there can be miracles,\" was too presumptuous (implying that you, not God, actually *did* the miracle).  This translation goes a step further; **ashe\u0304len** \"achieve\" is more active a verb in Remian than its English translation, and although in prose I could use some split-S shenanigans to make it into a more absolutive structure (miracles-ACC achieve-3s 2p.INST or something like that, unspecified Agent doing miracles through you), this would break the rhythm and prosody.  The grammar is a little off in the verbal party at the end - prose would read **stis gin te\u0304ket** or more likely **stis gange te\u0304ken,** but this is poetry and things can bend here.\n\nI used the second-person plural rather than the singular or an impersonal subject both because the rhymes fit better and because of the ostensible audience of the song."

While some time-taking geological processes are simulated in the re-creation, fossil fuel formation isn't one of them, meaning that the availability of fossil fuels is virtually zero and always has been.  It also exists in a universe where electricity as such doesn't exist - the atomic-/subatomic-level issues are taken care of by differing physical laws, bioelectricity is replaced by a life force, and lightning is actually the wrath of angry gods.  While magic *can* do some of the things that electrical power or fossil fuels can do in the real world, it isn't actually an ersatz for either.\n\nBut **for the purpose of this question**, assume that the physics are roughly real-world, except that (1) fossil fuels are not and never have been available, and (2) electricity has not and can never be channeled into batteries or power grids.  You can also assume a full and rapidly-replenishing Earthlike biosphere, so animal oils, for instance, will remain a thing.\n\nMy question:  (1) What inventions and discoveries of the 19th and 20th centuries could *actually* be discovered/invented without access to fossil fuels or electric power, and (2) How possible would it be to deploy them on a mass scale?  (Obviously mass production of *anything* is going to be curtailed with no fossil fuels, but some things would be harder than others.)\n\nNote that this is not a \"Dies the Fire\" or \"peak oil\" scenario where the world once *had* these things and *lost* them - they've never had them in the first place.  Combustion works normally so biodiesel *would* work as a fuel source, but would people think to invent biodiesel if they hadn't had regular diesel first?  This has been an issue with prior research I've done into this topic - most of the discussion is about green alternatives and green-tech, but (1) they still assume electricity is a thing, just that it's coming from renewable sources, and (2) they assume prior knowledge or hindsight of the brown-tech they're an alternative to.\n\nThe inventions whose viability I am particularly interested in:\n\n* Photography / cameras,\n* Radio / telegraphy / telephones,\n* Chemical fertilizers and fertilizer production,\n* Rubber, vulcanization, and elastics\n* Food preservation / refrigeration\n* Domestic climate control (heating/air conditioning)\n* Guns, artillery, and similar military technologies\n\nThank you for any assistance you can provide or resources you can point to."

For the sake of this thought experiment God with all of his power and wisdom could have brought the whole world into existence when this is posted, created the memories of my whole life (including the memory of writing this post) in that very instant. Due to our finite nature we would not be able to distinguish between a world created a second ago, 6,000 years ago or 5.4 billion years ago. We can remember events in our lives and what we have observed but how do we truly know where the memories come from? We are part of a universe created by God who is by nature outside of and existing before our universe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy all accounts Genesis could very well be metaphorical, however if the testimony of the word of God is to be believed (which I believe it is). I think that calling it figurative dangerously close to undermining the inerrant nature of scripture. Secular science could be accurate when it comes to the hypothetical origins of the Universe and Genesis is then sub-sequentially figurative. More plausible for a believer of God's word is that Genesis is true beginning to end and that God in his perfect wisdom made the universe to look as though Genesis is figurative. As he has caught wise in their craftiness so to speak and it is a stumbling block for those who are wise in their own sight. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake dinosaurs, leviathan was mentioned in the book of Job and may have roamed the Earth in that time. The \"millions of years old\" fossils we see today very well could have always been there just as they were. God's power and knowledge is beyond our comprehension he knew how to form every single thing down to their atoms in a blink of an eye. There is undoubtedly more we have not yet discovered about his creation and it simply proves what an all powerful and all knowing God entails."

I'm a seasoned roadie and let's say advanced beginner or intermediateish on dirt, so decently comfortable going most places besides gnarly technical singletrack. \n\nDo you have any recommendations for which of the parks around here in the South Bay and Peninsula have the best MTB riding for beginners? Not really trying to go as far as the North or East Bay, given the current situation. So far I've personally checked out Fremont Older, Arastradero, and Santa Teresa.

I already have my M1 so it doesn't really matter to me, but I'm curious to know in case friends looking to get theirs ask, etc. \n\nBill text is [here](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1027):\n\n>AB 1027, Acosta. Driver\u2019s licenses: examinations: motorcycle licenses.\n\n>Under existing law, upon application for an original driver\u2019s license, except student licenses, the Department of Motor Vehicles shall require an examination of the applicant. Existing law requires that the examination test the applicant\u2019s knowledge and understanding of, among other things, the provisions of the Vehicle Code governing the operation of vehicles upon the highways. Existing law authorizes the department to accept a certificate of satisfactory completion of an approved novice motorcyclist training program, as specified, in lieu of a driving test on motorcycle license applications. With regard to a person under 21 years of age, existing law requires completion of an approved motorcycle safety training program for issuance of a class M1 or M2 license or endorsement.\n\n>This bill would instead authorize the department to accept any certificate of satisfactory completion of an approved motorcyclist training program, as specified, in lieu of a driving test on motorcycle license applications. With regard to a person under 21 years of age, the bill would instead require completion of a novice motorcycle safety training program for issuance of a class M1 or M2 license or endorsement.\n\nIf I'm reading this correctly, the new wording says \"This bill would instead authorize the department to accept any certificate of satisfactory completion of an approved *~~novice~~* motorcyclist training program\", where the \"novice\" wording was removed from the old form of the law. So as an example would someone be able to take an approved intermediate course instead of specifically the CMSP intro-level course? I'm confused at what the legislators are trying to get at here. Thanks in advance!"

But today I was pushing myself to my absolute limits during the all-outs, hitting a personal best at 9.7 (only sustainable for 30 secs!). At the end of class, the lovely lady next to me told me I was an inspiration,  and that she was going to try to transition from power walking to jogging. She seemed surprised when I told her that if I could do it, she definitely could, since I'm in no way a natural runner. The biggest piece of advice I offered was to keep chipping away at your speed consistently and to get your heart rate monitor adjusted. Honestly, getting my monitor adjusted made \\*such\\* a huge difference for me--before doing so, I was unknowingly not pushing myself nearly as hard as I could have been because it was so easy to rack up the splats. Now my only fear is flying off the treads if my little legs stumble! I felt really emotional after OTF today knowing that I inspired someone else to push themselves. Every class does add up!"

                "body": "Who do you think deserves to be in the Mt. Rushmore of bass? Not your favourites, but four names that you think are the most influential, innovative, or just generally great\n\nHere's mine. \n\nNote that I factor in influence more than anything, and I try to make it diverse. Also, I'm exclusively narrowing it down to electric bass\n\n1. **James Jamerson**. It goes without saying that the first significant figure of electric bass should be included. He made the electric bass it's own unique thing and not just a louder version of an upright. He was also the first to employ melodic, distinctive lines in pop music, thus introducing millions to the magical potential of the electric bass. Every bass player today is influenced by him on some level. Jamerson is the archetype of the modern bassist\n\n2. **John Entwistle**. If Jamerson was the first to make the bass shine, Entwistle was the first to shove it in your face. He  was the original \"lead\" player that showed everyone how the bass can also be wild and explosive, not just make warm, nice sounds. All the bangers, shredders, show offs, metalheads of bass are sons of the Ox. Plus, he was heavily involved in the creation of both roundwound bass strings and Marshall stacks-- forever changing not just the sound of rock bass, but the sound of modern music in general\n\n3. **Larry Graham**. Another obvious one, in my opinion. An entire style of bass playing (slap) is attributed to him-- that's an insane legacy to have. Can you imagine funk, dance, modern rnb, and well, 99% of youtube bassists would sound if it wasn't for Larry Graham's brilliance? The entire bass landscape wound sound completely different, and way more boring.\n\n4. **Jaco Pastorius**. Not gonna waste my energy on this one. Many would say that he was the greatest to ever do it. Combined technical proficiency and feel, innovativeness and raw energy, power and beauty like no other has ever done before on the bass. Oh and he also popularized the fretless\n\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nIt's not easy to cutting down the entire history of an instrument to just four names. Here are some that I almost put it but didn't. I'll explain why\n\nThese guys were mainly left out because of my variety policy\n\n1. Paul McCartney. An incredibly creative player. Nothing I respect more than a player who can make lines that are both easy to play yet memorable. With that said, I excluded him  mainly because he's in the same lane as Jamerson. Both men's biggest contributions are introducing melodic bass to pop music and they have somewhat similar styles, which led me to pit them against each other. I favoured Jameson because he did it first and, in my opinion better. Also, if you listen to Beatles' catalog, McCartney was a standard roots-fifth rock bass player for a huge part of the discography. He didn't really become a distinctive player until around 1966/67. By that time Jamerson, Entwistle, Jack Casidy and Jack Bruce were already around \n\n2. Carol Kaye. Almost the same reason as McCartney. I'm not gonna have two session legends mostly known for pop and rnb records, and no one did this better than Jamerson anyway\n\n3. Stanley Clarke. This was the hardest omission. An amazing player and probably the first jazz star to use the electric bass. I wouldn't argue if anyone put him in it, but I just can't place him over Jaco man.."

I.e. Nirvana was alternative rock/noise rock, Soundgarden was hard rock/heavy metal, Alice in Chains was alternative metal/sludge metal, etc... These bands were not labeled grunge because they share a distinct sound and musical lineage, but because they all just happened to be in the same place at the same time.\n\nThat's not to say you'd be wrong for calling these bands grunge, just that the term more accurately refers to a cultural period than a specific musical style."

It's just that nothing feels right. \n\nI kept turning away at the kissing and making comments (usually I have a filter but I'm so fucking tired tonight my filter was just gone and I was just blurting out all the little things my dumbass brain thought of) and m parents just seemed well disappointed is the wrong word but it's close. They said things like \"what do we do wrong?\" \"How did we raise you not to like love\" and I'm sure you've all heard it all before. All the classics. My brother went on the say I was acting younger than my sister (she's 11, I'm 17) when I was turning away from the kissing scenes and making comments about how gross they were. It really just feels like I don't belong with them. Like I'm a defect. Like something wrong with me. Not to mention I'm also bi and non binary. My sister is the only person who even remotely understands even a little. She's pan and so emotionally mature. Shes the only person in the house that makes me feel human. \n\nAnd I know there's nothing wrong with me. I know that there's other people out there like me. But it still fucking hurts. It hurts that I don't fit in at all. I just want to fit in. It's so hard to just not fit in. It feels like I'm not meant for this world or like this world isn't ready for me and I just. I don't know. \n\nIt was the most arduous 2 1/2 hours of my life. It felt like 5 hours. I'd keep checking to see how long there was left in the movie and the bar would have only inched along by miniscule amounts. \n\nBut I mean it wasn't all horrible. The story line with the little kid was really cute. And I guess the one with the Portuguese woman was bearable. Everything just seemed so... Unrealistic? Like I just can't believe that any of that is really real stuff. I was pleased at the musician and his manager story line. That one seemed pretty realistic to me. A little out of nowhere but it seemed like it could happen. And I was glad about the representation. I honestly thought it was gonna be a totally straight show until that point especially considering it was from like 2003 or smthn. \n\nI don't know what I'm making this post for. Sympathy? Maybe. Validation? That would be nice... I just. I just do not know. I wish I could just live my life without feeling like a freak. \n\nWhatever. Sorry this was so long."

JA\u2019MARR CHASE | LSU 6003 | 201 lbs. | JR. Harvey, La. (Archbishop Rummel) 3/1/2000 (age 21.16) #1 BACKGROUND: Ja\u2019Marr Chase grew up in southern metropolitan New Orleans in the Harvey-Gretna areas, starring in baseball, basketball and football. He attended  high school at Archbishop Rummel, a Catholic school in northern New Orleans with one of the best football programs in the state (he was high school teammates with  former LSU CB Kristian Fulton). Chase started playing varsity as a sophomore and became the school\u2019s all-time leading receiver with 115 catches, 2,152 receiving  yards and 30 touchdowns over his career. Although his senior year was cut short due to a knee injury, he set the school\u2019s single-season records with 61 catches for  1,011 yards and 15 touchdowns in 2017, becoming the first player in Rummel history to eclipse the 1,000-yard receiving mark. As a senior, Chase was named First  Team All-State and Offensive MVP in the Catholic League. He also participated in track, winning the 5A state title in the long jump (24\u20192.25) as a junior. A four-star recruit out of high school, Chase was the No. 15 wide receiver in the 2018 class and the No. 4 recruit in the state of Louisiana (No. 2 receiver behind  Terrace Marshall). He originally planned to sign with Ole Miss before the school was hit with NCAA sanctions. He turned his attention to TCU before changing his mind  to Florida, committing to the Gators prior to his senior season. However, he reopened his recruitment late in his senior season when Jim McElwain was fired. On  signing day, Chase narrowed down his final choice to Auburn and LSU, signing with LSU and reuniting with his former Archbishop Rummel teammate Kristian Fulton.  His father (Jimmy) played college football at Alcorn State. Chase elected to opt out of the 2020 college football season and declare for the 2021 NFL Draft.

SUMMARY: A two-year starter at LSU, Chase was the X receiver in offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger\u2019s offense, lining up both inside and outside. He had an  historic sophomore season with Heisman winner Joe Burrow throwing him the football, becoming the first player in LSU history to reach 2,000-plus receiving yards in  his first two seasons. Chase is extremely talented after the catch and with the ball in the air, exemplifying the \u201cmy ball\u201d attitude to consistently win the catch point  (plays like a smaller Larry Fitzgerald). He is an above average athlete and appears very natural with his route movements, but needs to do a better job making every  route look the same off the line of scrimmage. Overall, Chase creates separation with his gear-changing acceleration and is an elite finisher with his physical ball  skills, displaying equal parts competitive toughness and playmaking skills to be an NFL No. 1 receiver. GRADE: 1st Round (No. 4 overall)\n\n1. KYLE PITTS | Florida 6055 | 245 lbs. | JR. Philadelphia, Pa. (Archbishop Wood) 10/6/2000 (age 20.56) #84 BACKGROUND: Kyle Pitts was born and raised in the Philadelphia area and started playing flag football at 6 years old. He spent his freshman and sophomore years at  Abington Senior High School (about 15 miles north of downtown) and played primarily quarterback and linebacker after coaches refused to move him to tight end, his  desired position (he saw himself like Eric Ebron or Jared Cook). Looking for an opportunity to change positions, Pitts transferred to Archbishop Wood High School, a  private school in Warminster, Pa., where he was teammates with future FBS players like RB Raheem Blackshear (Rutgers/Virginia Tech) and CB Mark Webb (Georgia).  He helped lead the school to back-to-back PIAA Class 5A state championships as a junior and senior, blossoming into the team\u2019s best player as a tight end and  defensive end. In Wood\u2019s power-run scheme, Pitts had moderate production (321 receiving yards and five touchdowns in 2017), but he also excelled as a blocker and  pass rusher, posting two interceptions in the championship game as a senior. Pitts, who grew from 6-feet to 6-feet-5 between his freshman and senior years in high  school, also played basketball and ran track at Archbishop Wood. A four-star tight end recruit out of high school, Pitts was the No. 5 ranked tight end in the 2018 class and the No. 4 recruit in the state of Pennsylvania behind LB  Micah Parsons (Penn State), QB Phil Jurkovec (Notre Dame/Boston College) and TE Zack Kuntz (Penn State). He received high-profile offers from Alabama, Georgia,  Ohio State and Penn State, but narrowed his choice to Florida and Virginia Tech, choosing the Gators. His father (Kelly) played basketball in junior college. His sister  (Tenae) ran track collegiately at Maryland Eastern Shore, competing in short-distance events and long jumps. Pitts elected to skip the bowl game and his senior  season and enter the 2021 NFL Draft.

SUMMARY: A two-year starter at Florida, Pitts lined up mostly detached (slot and outside) while also seeing inline snaps with his hand on the ground in head coach  Dan Mullen\u2019s scheme, which requires versatility from the tight ends. He leaves Gainesville as the most productive tight end in school history, setting a Gators record  for receiving yards (1,492) at his position. Described as a \u201cunicorn\u201d by the Florida coaching staff, Pitts is what a twitchy big man looks like, using his natural reflexes,  flexible movements and athletic ball skills to be a cheat code as a pass-catcher. Although he lacks the body power to sustain or drive block, he is a willing and  competitive contributor as a blocker. Still, he should be evaluated more as a weapon than a traditional tight end. Overall, Pitts boasts special athleticism to separate  in coverage and the elite pass-catching skills to be a mismatch playmaker similar to Darren Waller. He projects as a unique \u201cmove\u201d tight end and one of the best  talents in this draft. GRADE: 1st Round (No. 2 overall)\n\n2. PENEI SEWELL | Oregon 6047 | 331 lbs. | JR. Malaeimi, American Samoa (Desert Hills) 10/9/2000 (age 20.56) #58 BACKGROUND: Penei (peh-NAY) Sewell, who is the fourth of five children in his family, grew up playing football in a beach village in American Samoa. The family  decided to move from the South Pacific island to St. George, Utah, in 2011 when his father (Gabe Sr.), who coached high school football, started to experience chest  pains and required additional medical care. Sewell attended Desert Hills High School where he blossomed into one of the top prep players in the country as a four\u0002year starter at right tackle, also playing defensive tackle on defense. Despite battling a shoulder injury during the 2017 season, Sewell earned First Team All-League  and All-State honors as a senior, paving the way for 2,551 rushing yards for the offense. A four-star offensive guard recruit out of high school, Sewell ranked as the No. 2 guard nationally (behind Georgia\u2019s Jamaree Salyer) and the No. 1 recruit in Utah. He  received no shortage of scholarship offers and narrowed his choice to Alabama, Oregon, USC and Utah before picking the Ducks. Sewell was the second-highest  ranked player from Utah ever to sign at Oregon, just behind Haloti Ngata. Though Sewell was listed as a guard by recruiting services, Oregon always saw him as a  tackle and he was just one of nine FBS true freshman offensive linemen to start the 2018 season opener. He grew up in a football family: his older brother (Gabe Jr.)  played linebacker at Nevada (2015-19). His older brother (Nephi) just completed his redshirt junior season at Utah at linebacker. His younger brother (Noah) is a true  freshman linebacker at Oregon (and former five-star recruit). His uncle (Isaac Sopoago) was a nose tackle at Hawaii and drafted in the fourth round of the 2004 NFL  Draft (No. 104 overall) and played 11 seasons in the NFL. His uncle (Richard Brown) played 10 seasons in the NFL at linebacker. Sewell elected to opt-out of the 2020  college football season and enter the 2021 NFL Draft.

WEAKNESSES: Lacks elite length and reach by NFL standards\u2026must improve his timing mid-set, playing too much with rushers in chest\u2026occasionally out-angled in the  run game and must improve his body position\u2026his mean streak comes and goes and needs to be a more consistent finisher\u2026competes with confidence, but is still  discovering his assertiveness\u2026missed the first two drives against Arizona (November 2019) after he was late to a team meeting\u2026medicals will need to be examined  after missing the second half of his freshman season with a high right ankle sprain (October 2018), which required surgery; suffered a torn left labrum in his shoulder  (August 2017) before his senior year in high school, but played through the injury, pushing surgery until after the season. SUMMARY: A two-year starter at Oregon, Sewell lined up at left tackle in former offensive coordinator Marcus Arroyo\u2019s scheme, allowing only one sack in 1,376  career snaps for the Ducks. He made an immediate impact in Eugene (first true freshman lineman since 1997 to start a season opener at Oregon) and leaves as one of  the most decorated players in school history, joining LaMichael James and Marcus Mariota as the only Ducks to earn unanimous All-American status. For a blocker  with his size and strength, Sewell is astonishingly efficient with his movement patterns due to his natural flexibility and footwork. Not only does he offer impressive  physical traits, but his split-second reads and reflexes also are advanced for a player his age (Cristobal: \u201cI think of him as overall the best football player I\u2019ve been  around\u2026the combination of football IQ, want to, work ethic and raw ability\u201d). Overall, Sewell must develop his body angles, timing and finishing skills, but he has  prestigious big man balance, mobility and football instincts. He projects as an immediate NFL starter at left tackle with Pro Bowl potential. GRADE: 1st Round (No. 5 overall)\n\n3. RASHAWN SLATER | Northwestern 6042 | 304 lbs. | SR. Sugar Land, Texas (Clements) 3/26/1999 (age 22.09) #70 BACKGROUND: Rashawn Slater grew up in the suburbs of Houston as the third of four children and attended William P. Clements High School in Sugar Land (about 30  minutes southwest of downtown Houston). He started playing varsity as a sophomore and was a three-year starter (on both the offensive and defensive lines) and  lined up at guard as a junior and left tackle as a senior. Despite a 3-27 team record in his three varsity seasons, Slater twice earned First Team All-District honors on  the offensive line and was named Second Team All-Greater Houston as a senior. He also lettered four years in track, competing in the shot put and discus.  A three-star offensive guard recruit out of high school, Slater ranked as the No. 32 guard nationally and the No. 91 recruit in Texas. He went overlooked by most Big  12 and Texas programs (Rice was the only Texas school to offer him a scholarship). Slater received three offers from Power 5 programs (Illinois, Northwestern,  Kansas), committing to Northwestern as a junior in high school. His father (Reggie) played college basketball at Wyoming (school\u2019s all-time leading rebounder) and  went undrafted in the 1992 NBA Draft but played eight seasons in the NBA as a journeyman (1,450 points and 768 rebounds in 259 career games). His older brother  (R.J.) played offensive line at Air Force (2014-18). Slater elected to opt-out of the 2020 college football season and enter the 2021 NFL Draft.

WEAKNESSES: Doesn\u2019t have the desired body type for NFL edge work\u2026lack of arm length will be more pronounced vs. NFL rushers\u2026his overeager hands will make  contact before his feet are ready\u2026tends to get grabby and needs to punch than grip more consistently\u2026late to reset and adjust to inside moves, setting hard with his  outside steps\u2026didn\u2019t play guard or center in college and could be bullied by NFL power on the interior\u2026missed one start as a junior due to injury (October 2019). SUMMARY: A three-year starter at Northwestern, Slater lined up at left tackle in former offensive coordinator Mick McCall\u2019s scheme, starting as a true freshman right  tackle for a head coach (Pat Fitzgerald) not known for playing young players. He steadily developed over his three years in Evanston, including a standout  performance against Ohio State\u2019s Chase Young in 2019, and should be Northwestern\u2019s first offensive draft pick in the first two rounds since 1995. Slater will have  trouble vs. long-armed rushers in the NFL, but he is agile, stout and power-packed and doesn\u2019t allow rushers to go through him (Isaiah Wynn conversation all over  again). He is very quick to lock up pass rushers before they can set up their moves, staying connected due to his leveraged attack (zero sacks allowed in 2019).  Overall, Slater will be graded as an offensive tackle on some draft boards and a guard/center on others, but regardless, he offers the smart, technically sound  approach to be a plug-and-play NFL starter, and would best fit in a zone scheme.

                "body": "Hello, I'm 21 and since I was a teenager I've been wanting to 'lose weight. As a teenager, I was obese and felt ugly and uncomfortable in my body. About 2 years ago I lost about 8kg (17lb) going from weighing 76kg (168lb) to 68kg (150lb) by doing BootCamp for 4 months. I wanted to lose 8kg more so I could reach my ideal weight of 60kg (132lb). Those 4 months were so tiring and exhausting. I was on a diet and I could not find the energy to do anything besides cooking myself food. I was lethargic throughout the day. \n\nAfter I stopped the BootCamp I was afraid of gaining back the weight that I almost got an eating disorder. Since stopping the Bootcamp I've been able to maintain the weight by exercising at home almost every day for at least 30mins or eating significantly less food for my main meals (and both in some cases). I realised that this was not sustainable and that during these days I would feel tired and hungry. After a while, I started munching on food throughout the day which meant that I did not lose any weight. I just maintained the weight I had. It took a huge chunk of my time to exercise and prepare healthy meals. \n\nRecently, due to inflation and terrible weather causing floods the price of fruits and vegetables where I live has increased and it's quite expensive to eat vegetables. Having uni also meant that it was hard to balance studying, exercising and cooking. Now I have noticed that I have put some weight on. I feel so conscious of my stomach and can feel that it's gotten larger. I feel mentally exhausted thinking about having to 'lose weight' all the time and not seeing any progress. I don't know how to shed the weight sustainably and keep it off in the long term without spending a huge amount of time or energy. I've lost any motivation that I used to have. I also don't see many girls around my age hitting the gym, most of them are just skinny. Do you have any advice for me?"

                "body": "2020 and 2021 are years where everything is changing in my life. I think it all started with me going to kind of a spiritual retreat 'in your element' last year. I am air queen by the way haha. From that time the life started subtly nudging me to change in a lot of ways. I also now believe karma exist. Yesterday I had phone call with my father and he was basically thinking the same thing as was going through my head for some days, he has been with me on this journey, standing by all along. He was the one who took me to rehab, we cried together. He was the one who waited for me on the train station when I came back after month in Ecuador, we cried. There is lots of love, which I didn't feel before all the shit went down. It took all the shitty things to finally see I am loved (at least by my father and his family). I used to do drugs, drink, smoke. I would sleep around, cheated on my partner, got a high from being attractive to someone, got my self esteem from other people saying nice things about how I look  (still dealing with). I used to bully, abuse people, - family or classmates in elementary school. Feel superiror or inferior, problems with accepting equality (which I deal with to this day). I lied just to keep my own ass safe. Well I don't know how many delusions I've been able to shatter since, I just know it's been a 'TOWER' (tarot reference) all along ride. I stopped shaving and gained weight to see If I can love myself this way. I suddenly see the other end of the spectrum. Years before I might have been the cool skinny girl guys would hit on. Would look down on chubby girls. I now am this chubby girl. Realizing I have lots of internalized fatphobia, racism and even homophobia - and I identify as a pansexual. I am getting real. Really real. Authenticity changed my life. I told my toxic grandparents I am scared of them, and that they manipulate people and lie. I don't want to be around them anymore. They always said I was their favourite one and would buy me things and then they would blackmail me by this. I bought you a laptop so break up with your boyfriend. I also told my mother this year how neglected I felt. That I didn't feel love or care from her, it was always about her and I don't feel like she is my mom. Even for this I think I was escaping since I was 16-17 anywhere I could. I finally told my 'friend' what I think about our friendship. It's not real. She doesn't care about me and any time we would arrange meeting I would feel kind of a fear, not looking forward to it, leaving the meet up feeling worse than before. It just didn't feel right. I have other friends and I know I enjoy spending time with them. I think she secretly hates me. Whenever she would talk about someone saying something mean about me you could see the smirk on her face, just over split second, you could see it made her happy. When I would get upset she would say I was too sensitive. I was molested as a kid and I molested others too. I thought it was something forbidden and fun. I realize I've hurt people fucking lot. I don't know how much more karma is prepared for me in the future. All I know is that now I am alone. It hurts. And also that I am cleaning. Cleaning my mind, cleaning my relationships, cutting off things that don't work anymore. And as miserable as I sometimes feel, I also feel something that I never felt before. Something like..I am finally becoming who I really am. Getting rid of the dark black matter accumulated over the years. I now notice I smile on the pictures as I would smile as a kid. Just a big smile, without feeling like I have to hide my mouth because it's big because it doesn't look hot. I am going back to ecuador this year to a fruitarian community. I am a bit afraid and also looking forward to it. This is the next step in exploring and looking for ME"

Huge FPS drops, horrible filter efficiency and the latest, which forced me to factory reset my pc, HUMONGOUS stuttering. While at first I thought it was my pc needing a lower setting to perform better, it wasn't. Even at the lowest settings the game still stuttered like crazy. Like having major lag every few sec, whilst with a stable connection and nothing odd with the hardware.\nIt became quite literally unplayable. \n \nNote: the game normally ran absolutely gorgeous at 100~ fps(render 150%, everything ultra, no DLSS and raytracing on) and before the reset at 60~ fps (raytracing off). \n \nThings I tried WHICH didn't work:\nDowngrade game ready drivers, \nTurn on Dlss, \nTurn off raytracing, \nLowering render resolution, \nTurning all settings to their lowest, \nReset underclock/undervolt (I have my cpu underclocked and undervolted for lowered temps - and a slight performance drop), \nTurning off Intel gpu (don't do that - trust me on that), \nReinstalling the game multiple times (bless fast network), \nLowering settings in nvidia control panel, \nDisabling overlays (like GeForce Experience), \nClean pc of junk\n... And more... \n \nYeah... All the while other games had no or little issues. (Cold War runs horrible just like warzone).\nFunny thing Modern Warfare DID NOT suffer with the major performance drop and the stuttering. I maintained a reasonable performance drop there.\n \nA few days ago I had enough and I did a (msi specific) factory reset. \nThis put my drivers back up somewhere at the end of 2020.  \nAnother note: I did that because I disabled the Intel igpu in my bios and it resulted in my laptop screen staying blank, I have an external monitor that got me into Windows but that wouldn't be able to get me in the bios again. So I reset my bios through holding down the power button for a few min. After that I just had enough and I did a factory reset for good measure.\n \n!\nGeForce Experience version 3.22.0.32\nDriver version 442.23\nNO DLSS support\n!\n \nNow the game (and other games) run as expected.\nWarzone/MW runs 100~ fps absolutely gorgeous with game filters. \nI don't mind not running with DLSS since my performance is great and the temp are reasonable. Cpu and gpu won't go above 80. (before underclock cpu would surpass 90 and gpu would sit right below 85 - it did result in higher fps but that's not worth the potential long term damage and the airplane sound producing fans). \nI'd lower the underclock further and keep the game at 60 fps to maintain a better temp at some times.\n \nPs: if you see any grammar errors, please do let me know \n \nPs ps: if you want to know my game filter settings give me a heads-up\n  \nEdit: enumeration/summery of things that didn't work and a few spaces here and there"

I would really like the developers/publishers/product owners to read this and act on it, rather than doing too little too late.\n\ntl;dr at the end\n\nAt the beginning of the Cold War integration my buddies and I were excited about it. New guns, skins et cetera. Basically new content to delve into for many more hours of fun (and more money to spend on the awesome packs).\n\nBut it seems things didn't go the way we wanted to. Cold War is a mess, I mean really a mess. Not something we normally see from a 'should have been amazingly polished like every other CoD game' CoD game(? why not delaying the game for once ? and sit your golden butts on Warzone for longer ?). Although it is kind of fun and with the right updates and patches I'd see my buddies and I play it more often. But not now. I'm even considering a refund because I really am not pleased with the current state Cold War is in right now. \n\nBut alas, this is about Warzone. Warzone is as always has been fun to play(or should be). My buddies and I played it quite a lot and would play it a lot more if not for the horrible integration with Cold War. The guns that came along with Cold War are a nice addition but DAMN some of them are just plain cheat guns. Since the \\*\\*\\*DMR\\*\\*\\* and \\*\\*\\*Darmatti\\*\\*\\* came into the meta I had NO FUN PLAYING WARZONE. Hear me out please, we've had quite a few guns that used to be OP like the grau and \\*kuch kuch\\* dragon breath shotguns \\*kuch kuch\\*. But never have they overshadowed every other gun in the game like those two do. Countering OP guns is a challenge I'd like to face. Taking someone on whose using an OP gun and winning gives a nice kick(or losing and taking the defeat as it is). But challenging someone running DMR and/or Darmatti doesn't. Because you either go down like a fly or take them down in a 'not so clean or satisfying' way. Ever since they've become so 'meta' I (no joke), haven't gone down by any other gun outside of the gulag. It's insane and absolutely mad. Every gun fight against those cheat guns is nothing but infuriating. It's like I'm going into a gunfight with a hand tied on my back and my eyes covered. AND yet I refuse to give into the meta and run DMR/Darmatti myself. I will not feel the fake gratification of downing another player with a cheat gun AND I refuse to play with anyone who runs these cheat guns with them. Some things go too far, and these two guns do exactly that. For a franchise that is known for its great polished games this is not looking good, not good at all. I can imagine many more players not starting the game anymore simply because they know they'll get shat on by those clowns with DMR/Darmatti, utterly ruining their game experience and definitely tarnishing the good name Warzone had.\n\nI'd say give us back Warzone(and Modern Warfare <3) and remove the DMR/Darmatti from Warzone completely, at least until they get reworked. It feels like the design route Warzone had just took an extreme turn towards Trump-like-idiotic-insanity with no regard to the players, just Activision's(and shareholder's) wallets, thinking the game will get better with new content yet only achieving lower ratings, keeping twats in-game and players leaving the game. Within my friend group not a single person likes the CW integration thus far.\n\nWarzone has the blueprints of becoming a game that would stand for many years to come. And with that, generate plenty of revenue for overlord Activision. If only the players were more thought of rather than making a few quick bucks. It's ridiculous. Please do not get me wrong, I do like the idea of the CW integration with Warzone YET not when it takes away what has made Warzone such a behemoth of a success. Please balance the crap out of those guns and make the game PLAYABLE ONCE MORE for us peasants.\n\npfffew enough ranting. So just to add something positive to this post I'd like to say thank you Infinity Ward and others involved for making Warzone awesome and accepting my \\*kuch\\* donations for colourful content.\n\nTL;DR : rant about DMR/Darmatti and why I would love it if they be removed from Warzone."

I am trying to get a proper diagnosis, but it's currently not an option/easy to get access to) \n\nSo this leads me to today..I've been to this movie theater twice before with him and each time I end up feeling miserable and hating the experience because it's so loud and painful. The last time I sat for the entire movie silently stuck crying in my seat as for some reason I couldn't move. \n\nThe first time we went I had flares in the 2nd time it was an on the whim decision so no flares.. each time still waayyy too loud. I don't wanna stop doing things that he enjoys so much..and I really use to love movie theaters as a kid, it was my birthday present each year from my parents. \n\nThis is where the question comes in, would it be wrong of me to ask the theater for the assistive listening device and would it even help? \nMy anxiety has been insane with this as I have no idea how to even ask the theater if it would help without sounding rude as I know it's not explicitly for me..  \n\nAny guidance appreciated and thank you so much for reading."

(I fear I will never have a bra that fits properly especially after reading that bras just aren't made for shorter woman and I'm 4'10)\n\nThe issues I have with the 40DD are it pokes into my armpits, and I'm spilling out of the top of the cups.\n\nThe 40 band seems to fit very well and it's not digging or too loose, but I'm scared if i go up to 40DDD than there will be huge gapping as it happened the last time I tried on bras.\n\nFrom what i can tell I have shallow breasts so I was trying the balconette style in hopes to escape the normal gaping that all other bras gave me. (link in comments to show current bra)\n\nAll help is greatly appreciated, I'm so exhausted of bras and just wish the magic one would just drop outta the sky."

I think he does have layers to his personality, and he has all these quirks that really make him a special character. I think he's smart. I think it's good that he's just a normal person, it balances the show out pretty well. I do think they could have let us know more about him.\n\nThis post is about how FANS forget that Eiji is more than just an Ash fan girl, not about anime Eiji being a \"bad character\"."

All it achieved was destroying my mental health and my faith along with it. At the start of this year I made a promise to myself to finally deal with my mental health, and in my journey I have become a lot more accepting of my sexuality. I've got a long way to go, but I'm getting there.\n\nProblem is my family. I'm not stupid enough to think they would ever be able to accept me. I know because not long ago I was just like them. The only difference is I know what being gay actual feels like. I know my feelings are more than just disordered lust, it's deeper, it's real. My family on the other hand has no reason to change, and I honestly can't blame them.\n\nA lot of people would probably say to just ignore them, or even cut them out of my life entirely, but there are a lot of issues with that. For one, I don't have a full time job, and even if I did, the cost of living these days is through the roof, there is no guarantee I'd be able to afford moving out anyways. And living with them aside, their my family, I love them. Are they perfect, no, but I know they do their best, and that's really all I can ask for. I can't just cut them out of my life, but I also don't think I could have a good relationship with them while also being out.\n\nI finally feel like I'm at a point where I want to try dating, but even if I could somehow sneak around my parents, I know it wouldn't be fair to whoever I'm dating. If I had it my way, I would move out, preferably to another city, and just hide it from my family for the rest of my life. I know it's probably not feasible, especially since I want kids too. I feel like I'm trapped between a rock and a hard place, no matter what I do, I lose. I just wish I could do this without anyone being hurt."

Power Level is 10.\n\nBackground: Doc Mercury is an alien scientist that was exiled from his home world for trying to extend life, crash landing in New Mexico in 1865. He'd developed an immortality serum coded to his DNA, so I gave him a healing/affliction array, but I also want him to be able to alter his abilities and those of others. \nHe was discovered by the U.S. government shortly after World War II when he attempted to record a nuclear bomb test and was promptly offered a job. Eventually, he directed the creation of Area 51 and is known throughout the world as the esteemed human Doctor Victor Graham, one of the world's top medical minds.\n\nMy main questions:\n- Should I use Variable or Enhanced Trait for the chemical stuff? Currently I have a mix of both, mainly Enhanced Trait.\n- Is giving him a high Regeneration on top of Healing, Life Support, and Immortality overkill?\n- Can I put the Multiattack extra on Ranged healing because it requires an attack roll?\n- How should I build my defenses if I go ranged? Defenses are probably the part I am most confused about rn."

The first letter is pronounced as a 'th' like 'thimble,' but many people's dialects change it to an 's.' The second phonetic sound is supposed to be an \"oo\" as in 'look.' It can be transliterated with a U or an O (different regional accents can slightly change the vowel pronunciation, so don't sweat it.) There is an emphasis on the Y, so while most people use one letter Y, some people use two. While the most common Anglicization that I have seen is Soraya, it can also be spelled Thuraya, Thoraya, Thurayya, Thorayya, Soraya, Suraya, Surayya, or Sorayya. If you like, you can also add an H at the end, so you can really get creative. Soraya is one of my favorite names from my culture, and astronomy as a science has huge historic and cultural importance to us as well. This is a unique name which you may not have heard of if you come from the West, so if you like the name, I would encourage you to feel free to use it\u2661\n\n\nAnother Arabic name is Saif/Saiph, which means sword. It's the name of a constellation, and is used commonly in the Arab community (much like Surayya- maybe Saiph and Surayya for a sibling set?)",

But there hasn't been a lot of talk about what happens to Saviour Ois who are watching/listening/reading.\n\nNow, I am not officially typed but my peer typings are over 80% on the Saviour Oi side, with about 35 individual typings in my recod. As per the topic, when I get into entertainment, I get completely sucked in. I read a book in a day or two, can watch hours and hours of series my Di latches on to and have zero problems in staying focused. Things just roll and roll without me needing to do anything to them, and my mind fills in the blanks or just doesn't care; I'm in for the ride and I stick to it untill the end (or untill the material shows something utterly disturbing). I may skip ahead sometimes, if I deem some parts unnecessary, but other than that, I have no trouble just keeping my butt in it's place as stuff goes on.\n\nWhen I started OPS, I saw this as Saviour Consume/Oe, but up till now, all official types of those kind seem to not get on with this pattern at all. And if they do, it's for different reasons altogether. Which is interesting in itself; what is in saviour Oi then, that allows one to fully immerse one into the experience without distraction? Is it the need to \"organize/conceptualize this through from beginning to the end\" or something else? Have you noticed anything similar?"

I don\u2019t have \u201ca story I want to share\u201d.\n\nI never wrote my own stories for this reason and only ever wrote in text based role playing, where the world and the other characters where laid out for me except for my own. It was interactive and I was never found lacking for ideas to grab onto. I was passionately into it and could spend hours and hours on writing there. But now that I don\u2019t have that hobby anymore (I quit after 17 years), I still want to keep writing and perhaps turn this skill & passion into a book or two - writing for myself only, after all, is not something I have ever wanted to do.\n\nSo, because this skill or nature of having ideas for stories I want to tell still hasn\u2019t grown after all these years, I keep wanting to google some story prompts to give me a head-start. Would this be morally wrong for a writer to do if they want to publish the pieces in the future? Or is it perfectly okay to use these prompts for a baseline and inspiration?\n\nThanks in advance!"

One used to be all the way as pushy with his mDe as he is now, which makes sense typology-wise, but the other kept quiet for 40 years before speaking up to anyone else except her sister. Now she's a powerhouse who has even more trouble keeping herself from butting heads with others. It's like once the lid got opened, she can't put it back down.\n\nOf course, we can all do everything, but being presumably \"fDe\" on the outside with soft demeanor and being mostly quiet in times of conflict (seemingly low BP) would not put someone like this person as FM PBSC on a first or even the third glance. But knowing her for over the past 20 years now, that's what she definitely is - that is, unless we change our type as we grow older, which definitely isn't what OPS believes in.\n\nI'm wondering here if your mDe (or fDe in contrast) will create large clusterings of how one's life goes, or if it's still pretty irrelevant next to the animals & human needs.\n\nI know I used to get the bully bullied out of me, so I'd change to a more diplomatic type of a person which I am now. It's like the opposite of this friend, so I think I may have put too much focus on this aspect-detail of the system - which would be very typical of me, lol.\n\nSo... Seeing these differences, I would like to ask how your experience with mDe was growing up and if there is a big difference in how you acted then vs how you act now?"

It was sometimes out of fear of being rejected or chaos or whatever, but either way, I think the reactions I got from being well rounded was fulfilling. It was me who drove that, from my saviours to my demons.\n\nI didn't really realise that, though, for all around me the media and people were telling that you should just be your authentic self and from that find happiness and fulfillment. I started to slowly believe them, after a time of resistance, and switched my focus on \"finding myself\". The problem was, I didn't realize I was already myself and had found the whole me.\n\nWe are our whole selves when we embrace all of our functions and animals, and the message in the world is quite the opposite of that. They want us to indulge in our saviours only, which ultimately leads to the negative things D&S have taught us about.\n\nSo! Just now I had a situation where I was being more myself with a PB-lead customer, and just as she left, I noticed the empty, dark feeling in me from doing so. Even if I didn't behave badly and was neutrally okay, I didn't try to Play with her nor \"hold her hand\" as she needed me to, and my ultimately arrogant pov probably made her feel a bit embarrassed for her shortcomings with the situation. I hated to see that.\n\nFrom that realization, I am going back to my goals of being well rounded person and frankly, will not listen to what the people are saying anymore. That's funny, since in a way it's kind of doing my saviours, just in a different way than the \"be yourself\" movement calls for. In a way that calls for all of me being practiced, with care and good will.\n\nI didn't really need OPS to teach me this, but I did need the whole journey of finding typology & all these differing mindsets to find what is ultimately the best way to go forward in life. Thankfully I had found it beforehand, but we sometimes need these detours to show us we had the answer in us all along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf this was familiar to your journey, I hope to be of some encouragement: harness those damn demons and live your life like you were meant to do. x"

She, of course, isn\u2019t exactly looking forward to that Friday. She is struggling with social interaction, she is also suspected to be autistic just like me.

They eventually played everyday, but what my sister didn\u2019t tell her friend, is that our dog is going to pass away. I heard her asked our mom for advice on how to tell her friend that our dog is gonna pass away. So our mom said \u201cyou just have to wait for the right moment.\u201d. My sister took the advice, of course. When my sister and her friend were playing at our house, she decided to tell her friend.

Again, nanno could do the same, but at a VERY much powerful rate.\n\nAs for multiverses, it's only a theory, but nanno can most likely travel to other dimensions and timelines too.\n\nAnd on top of that, you have to deal with Nanno's multiple clones as well, and they're all probably equally the same in power.\n\nAnd let's not forget the fact that Nanno LITERALLY WIPED THE WHOLE POPULATION (ref s1 ep7) WITHOUT A SWEAT while thanos had to struggle with only half the population and needs a whole ass gauntlet just to flop so bad.\n\n\n\nAnd as for my final case, i'm going to state the the very obvious one here\n\n\n\n\n\nNanno is immortal :)",

I have 2 questions if someone can offer their opinion or advice.\n\n1. Is it faster/more-readable/more-efficient to clean data in the scrapy spider file or should you do it in preprocessing/feature-engineering stage of development. This goes from anything basic such as .strip() to something more complex such as converting imperial to metric, splitting values, creating new features, etc.\n2. Is it faster/more-readable/more-efficient to use *response.css('x.y::text').getall()* to create a list of values and create your dictionary from the list, or is it better practice to write a new response statement for every single dictionary value.\n\nI understand every case is a little different, but in general which method do you prefer?"

Both movements are supporting good causes, but the way they are going about it is very inorganic, fake, and not allowing any discourse to happen.\n\nI am seeing these *paid promotions* more frequently and they are becoming more aggressive. They are sowing the seeds of a divide. I wouldn't be surprised in 6 Months time pro-cars and anti-car debates will be common place evening news hours.\n\nIn a years time you'll have the tow the line of your respective parties take on anti-car stance or be cast an outsider"

It can help strengthen the transverse abdominis. Which can lead to a stronger core and draw in the layer of fat in between that muscle layer. But it would have to be used regularly and properly. Spot reduction of fat isn\u2019t a thing. But muscle and core conditioning is.\n\nThere are also waist trainers that aren\u2019t as noticeable.\n\nIf I had to guess this image is probably photoshopped because 1 it looks strange. And 2 there is a lot of static around the areas that would be edited.\n\nI\u2019ve seen people that have big legs hips and boobs and a smaller waist (not this small) that were wearing waist trainers. So this is my opinion on it. There\u2019s also surgery ofc",

It is hard for me to make sense on any given level. Myself is fabricated, an aberration. I am a noncontingent human being. My personality is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is persistent. My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared a long time ago (probably at r/Mbti) if they ever did exist. There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it, I have now surpassed. I still, though, hold on to one single bleak truth: no one is safe, nothing is redeemed. Yet I am blameless. Each model of human behavior must be assumed to have some validity. Is evil something you are? Or is it something you do? My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this\u2014and I have countless times, in just about every act I\u2019ve committed\u2014and coming face-to-face with these truths, there is no catharsis. I gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new understanding can be extracted from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this.
