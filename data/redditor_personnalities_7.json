The good news is that oval is the most versatile face shape. the bad news is that since you're oval, you already have height. Adding more just elongates your face unnecessarily. \n\ni suggest growing it out on the sides a little. \n\nin the meantime, try styling it a little more like he did.. he brought his bangs forward and curled over more whereas yours is a little more straight up.\n\nby bringing your bangs forward a little (at the root) you'll account for your oval face shape a little. (you do this by blow drying your hair forward and down, but not until it's completely dry. only until it's just slightly damp so you still have some wetness to work with) and then by curling it at the top more, (you might wanna try this with a 1.5 inch curling iron or a gf's hair straightener or something) you'll lessen the height and also add more definition/dimension. double win.\n\ntry that and good luck!",

And then seeing them all sad and depressed at present time is just heartbreaking.\n\nI was hoping Kiyomi was a good person but eh guess they only want the resources in Paradis. But it was nice to learn about Mikasa's oriental lineage and that she is a descendant of the Hizuru's ruler. \n\nIt's so sad to see Eren disrepecting Hange like that and I can see that Hange was really shaken from what Eren did. and Hange saying Erwin made a mistake for making Hange a commander was just heartbreaking.",

And now Eldians treat the Marleyans the same which is understandable from everything they went through. But it also shows how it's like a cycle and how the same thing is just happening over and over again. \n\nAnd that transition of Eren shooting to Sasha is so amazing because it looks like Eren shot Sasha and in  a way, like how Jean sees it, it was Eren's fault that Sasha is dead.\n\nI don't know what to think about the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers, it looks like they helped the Scouts but I feel like they have a different goals so I think it was right of Pyxis to be cautious especially now that Zeke is there.\n\nLol, speaking of Zeke, really love Zeke and Levi's interaction. It was so funny Levi took him to a forest and said it was a hotel for Zeke hahaha\n\nAnd Levi's greeting to the Marleyans made me laugh so hard.

There's literally barely anything left save for a couple of thin centimeters from the starting point on each side. Subsequently, I need to at least be able to make this disaster less noticeable while I try to let my eyebrows grow back.\n\nYou see, I used to have killer eyebrows and never had any issue with them until my mid-20s when I started getting thicker, longer, and greyer eyebrow hairs here and there, which to my surprise dramatically changed how the totality of my face looked. I've spent at least two years being very annoyed about it, but not really actively doing anything substantive to up my eyebrow grooming game, which finally lead to the dark events of last night.\n\nSo here I am, beseeching you good people for assistance. I've looked at a bunch of videos, products, and similar, but if there's one thing I know about the beauty industry, it is that it is a fertile ground for misinformation, scams, and nefarious monetary incentives. Browsing for products and reviews of products is exhausting because my alarm bells are constantly going off because of all the deceptively discreet sponsorships and ads that recommend things not necessarily because they're the best, but because some company paid them a lot of money.\n\nI'm a big fan of lists and specifics about products, so don't feel shy about overloading me with information. I also think it's quite fun to learn about various communities and their practices! I wish I didn't have to sacrifice my eyebrows to the beauty guru gods in order to prompt myself to do it, but here we are.\n\nThanks!"

I believe these spiders have roughly around 100 HP, and enemies will invariably target them due to low AC.\n\nThis is of course incredibly powerful on its own, and I think the implementation of the ring (especially in the shape of an early game item) was a poor decision from a balance perspective with these factors in mind, and that\u2019s before I even get to the multitudinous bugs this item has. \n\nFirstly, the game registers a party member going invisible as falling unconscious. This has a number of consequences. For example, Nenio can use her free action invisibility 8 times in one turn to instantly summon 8 relatively high health large spiders that can easily surround your enemies due to their sheer size, so this oftentimes effectively means that they can\u2019t even get to your party.\n\nOkay, so the ring is very strong, but does it break the game? Yes, due to what else the game considers falling unconscious, namely dying and being hit while the Last Stand mythic ability is active. **This also applies to summons**. What this means in praxis is that you have an endlessly self-generating army of damage sponges that will allow you to easily cheese almost any fight. Enemies will literally kill your spider and immediately continue their attack chain on a newly generated spider. I used this to kill Playful Darkness on Unfair with no effort whatsoever and was never under threat of taking any damage because his little den was completely full of spiders.\n\nIn any case, is Owlcat aware of this? I really want to use the attack of opportunity aspect of the ring, but I don\u2019t want combat to not require any strategy. The ring is frankly probably bugged in more ways than this one too, but these were the ones I discovered."

                "body": "Hello! I'm a long-time Darkest Dungeon veteran, and recently started playing this game; just got my first GAW-win. I'm looking for people's experiences and recommendations for builds they may have had success with - maybe this could be a place to share builds \\*specifically\\* for GAW runs - I don't really care about builds for Cakewalk/More Pain, as anything can be viable there.\n\nPersonally, I used a tank-and-spank crit/buffing strat with Lost Soul/Mummy/Vampire/Bone golem. Never changed up my comp, and half-way through the dwarven floor I stopped running into problems. The strategy would fall apart without Golem or Lost soul though, and not having Mummy would be problematic if I didn't have Dispel. The party had very good synergy with all of the naturally generated wards on every single minion.\n\nOtherwise, Vampire and Mummy can techincally be changed out for something else, but they provided great synergy with crits and dished out good damage, especially once I picked up the 30 % perma buff to attack artifact. At that point, I could just recharge my mana constantly with vampire crits using the 15 % damage converted into mana-artifact, and spam Death Fingers/party damage buffs. Vampire's ward/block-strip was also very useful early-game. Golem had the agro pull-artifact and his cultist damage reduction artifact. Tanked everything very well once I unlocked the 20 % self-heal rather than the 10 % version. Golem feels quite overpowered in contrast to everything else to be frank, and becomes unstoppable with damage-buffed ult spam once you buff him up with attack boosts and provide support with Lost Soul. \n\nLost Soul also seems kind of overpowered by the way - nothing even comes close to the party sustain and buffs she is capable of putting out. I loved equipping her with the first turn double action-artifact, using the AOE stress on her first turn to give buffs/take care of wards, then using the spell that grants +luck to everything and consuming the enemies' buffs with her ult.\n\nAnyway, hope to hear some other cool strats!"

Also, I have no good special ability Oddish. \n\nAs for DPSers, I have a steamroll Exeggutor, but it feels like such a shame to not take advantage how his multi hit moves due to having no rapid bulls eye.

I played it in the early 2000's on a computer with WindowsXP, but the game might have been decades older.\n\nAs mentioned in the title the main character and theme changed from level to level, and you only had three lives. The art style was pixelated and low res. The enemies moved mindlessly in circles in enclosed areas, and as you collect items you needed to be tactical as not to open up those enclosed areas and let the enemies escape, because if they touched you you instantly died.\n\nLink to drawing I made: [https://imgur.com/a/5BGxVrj](https://imgur.com/a/5BGxVrj)\n\nIN THE DRAWING I TRY TO ILLUSTRATE THIS GAME MECHANIC: In image A you see the starting point, where the cowboy starts. You make your way through the level and destroy the brown pieces (I don't remember what they looked like) to get to the coins. In image B you see what the game looks like after you have started to move around and the cowboy has collected five gold coins: If you happen to touch one of the brown pieces enclosing the revolver that has a closed path, it will escape into the path you have created, and therefore you need to start running from it, as it will get closer to you bit by bit and instant kill you. How to win the level? That, I unfortunately don't remember. Maybe by collecting a certain number of coins?\n\nAlso, I am not a skilled artist, so you will just have to imagine a retro type of western artwork and color scheme.\n\nThese are the levels I remember:\n\n\\- Cowboy (first level) collecting gold coins. Enemy: spinning revolvers.\n\n\\- A baker collecting apples. Enemy: ?\n\nA doctor collecting (?). Enemy: ?\n\n\\- Astronaut collecting suns. Enemy: Black holes?\n\nI would guess there were 5-10 levels in increasing difficulty."

I have very strong opinions regarding this sub, it\u2019s a little much. \n\nHowever I\u2019d like to defend my view at least\u2026 I think if you want a genuine answer to the question \u201cdo people on the sub overall like or dislike these posts\u201d the answer is probably that most don\u2019t care or genuinely like the post. Very few cranky weirdos like me seriously dislike them, and most of us have either left the sub or just don\u2019t engage anymore because of the sudden changes over the past year or so. \n\nIt\u2019s evident that most users of the sub now (especially since most are very new over the past year or year and a half I believe) like the direction of the sub and like these low-effort posts, even just given by the engagement with these posts. They always have tons of upvotes and comments even when the post itself is not very interesting. (One of the reasons is partially because images/memes always get more upvotes on reddit, but I digress\u2026) \n\nIn my opinion though, the high engagement with these posts and the fact that most people like it or don\u2019t mind them is not like rock-solid enough of a reason to keep them. Personally I believe the integrity of the sub is more important than the popularity. I would argue that the sub has gotten lower quality /because/ the direction has changed and because it\u2019s grown so much. Removing these types of posts and returning to shitpost only would upset many people but I don\u2019t automatically interpret that as a bad thing. I genuinely believe this was a better, higher quality sub when it was less popular but had a strong culture that understood the purpose of the sub. Sacrificing popularity for a more interesting, distinct, and purposeful sub is worth it in my opinion. Is it too late for that, 1-2 years later, who knows. But I will stubbornly hold the return to monke circlejerk sub position.",

Personally I would revert everything back to only shitposting. However my initial gut reaction and extreme response (sorry for that) was towards the unironic \u201ctype me by my art/photo/etc\u201d and now posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyMBTI/comments/117ud05/just_sharing_some_enfpixie_arts_and_writing_i_did/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyMBTI/comments/115b5ht/fellow_intp_barbs_wya/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) which are just infinitely worse because at least the screenshot posts are SOMEwhat staying on topic (albeit terribly and unfunnily) by shitting on the main sub or complaining about something mbti-related. This on the other hand, if it\u2019s allowed (which it is by not being immediately removed by mods due to being off topic), just turns the sub into a copy of r/mbti or r/mbtitypeme or other. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyMBTI/comments/11295lc/i_did_the_thing_thought_it_was_interesting_but/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) post even admits in the title itself that it\u2019s using this sub as an overflow for the main sub. Why wouldn\u2019t obviously unrelated posts like these just be removed? \n\nI really believe that to keep the charm of this subreddit the moderating has to be more strict, so that it doesn\u2019t become another generic mbti sub. I would go to more extreme lengths with the moderating myself to restore the sub to its former glory, which is just my personal bias, but please for the love of god at least make people stay somewhat on topic.",

I wanted to challenge my mental block of not walking around in a certain area, so I went on a walk to explore it.

It was actually nice for a while until someone stopped me to try to strike up a conversation and hit on me. This guy kept saying \u201care you sure you\u2019re not lost? You were like looking lost and looking all over the place\u201d and each time I said, no not lost just walking. He asked me THREE separate times and the third time was even like \u201cwe are NEIGHBORHOOD NAME\u201d slowly as if I was an idiot. That was my cue to just walk away. I hope he was just a misguided, awkward person, but my city has high rates of human trafficking, so... Once the discomfort of that exchange set in as I kept walking, I just felt so angry and upset and defeated. \n\nEven if that wasn\u2019t an attempt to \u201cbefriend\u201d a vulnerable person for human trafficking, I\u2019m just so upset that I was right - I can\u2019t even just walk around my city the way that I want to. I wasn\u2019t even downtown. I\u2019m not even bothering anyone, just being my damn self. And this is not the first time I\u2019ve been stopped by someone thinking I\u2019m lost or new to an area (when I wasn\u2019t either) because of how I like to look at things when I walk.

I\u2019m nowhere near T , as I\u2019m not out and I am a minor , but I would like to ask some questions to see if I would like it . \n1 : at what age can you start it ? \nI\u2019ve heard some people say it\u2019s 16 , others 18 and honestly I\u2019m confused. \n2: what are the biggest changes ? \nI know that it changes your voice , but does it have affects about your body , like your hips or other more feminine parts of your body . \n3 is there more versions of it ? \nIs there only the shot ? If there are , what are they . ( I\u2019m not really that scared of vaccines or stuff like that , but I would prefer something else ) \n4 how fast does it effect you ? \nHow long does it take for your voice to change . \n5 does it on its own stop your period or do you have to take some other things for it to stop ? \n6 does it stop ? \nI think this one needs some explanation. Do you have to take it for the rest of your life or do you take it just for some years and your done ? \n7 is it reversible? Or it\u2019s permanent? \n   I think that\u2019s it .

Me being in puberty doesn\u2019t help either . Like I don\u2019t know who to ask and I\u2019m confused .I don\u2019t feel comfortable with female pronouns or the name my parents gave me either , it just feels wrong and I want to know that I\u2019m not just making a big deal out of this and when I grow up I\u2019m just gonna laugh like \u201c look at my little stupid self , she thought she was a boy \u201c or something like that . \n  So the question is : is it normal to not feel trans when you\u2019re little but now it doesn\u2019t feel right ?"

If they wanted a character to be universally perceived a certain way, then they should have written it better. Once it\u2019s in the open, it\u2019s out of the author\u2019s hands - Death of the Author. And then it just leads to the annoying authors and fans shrieking you\u2019re not SUPPOSED to like them, you\u2019re only supposed to see it this certain way. I always found it very limiting and unnecessary hostile to their own audience. It winds up needlessly dividing the fan base, makes one side always attack the other, and just limits and cripples any actual discussion. It just winds up being the same ideas repeated ad nauseam - \u201cI\u2019m one of the SMART ONES who gets it, unlike the stupid people who don\u2019t\u201d, buddy you\u2019re not original when literally every single discussion surrounding the media revolves around the constant complaint about a straw man of stupid people who don\u2019t get it, meanwhile the people who do are not only the majority, but the vocal one. It\u2019s not profound or groundbreaking to literally just repeat the most popular and accepted opinion broadly shared across the fandom, against a smaller sub group whose opinions are instantly discarded, rather then engaged with, because they don\u2019t \u201cget it.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t audiences and writers be more intended in *why* and *how* their work is \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d, and try to understand the other point of view, to see the flaws in their own work, and how 1, they failed to convey their message, and 2, how they could do better, or 3, even come to change their minds?\n\nPeople are allowed to like who they want to. They shouldn\u2019t be yelled at by the author or the fan base because the intended intent was not conveyed successfully enough. When you create a message and you fail at it being successfully interpreted by thousands, if not millions, I think that says more about the ineffectiveness of the original writing - even the premise itself - rather then the supposed poor comprehension of the \u201cstupid fans\u201d who \u201cjust don\u2019t get it\u201d. Maybe the real truth is that in fact, it\u2019s the original author, and their sycophant fans, who doesn\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d.\n\nEdit: You guys are too stupid to understand the point I was trying to make. But at the same time, this means that I failed to get my point across\u2026so I proved myself right\u2026REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"

                "body": "Jordis is the Housecarl assigned to you when you not only became Thane of Haafingar by aiding the people of the Hold, by defeating Potema, by delivering Torygg's War Horn to Whiterun, but by purchasing a manor that is literally worth more gold then killing the Emperor. \n\nJordis seems fairly young. She has the same voice as Elisif and is called Maiden in her title. Yet, she is already a very competent and powerful warrior, and like all Housecarls, can go up to Level 50 by default. So she\u2019s one of the best warriors in Skyrim. She is also assigned to the most expensive home in game, to a Thane who is either the literal Dragonborn, or a warrior who stopped Potema and became the Thane of one of Skyrim\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful Holds. \n\nWho is Jordis the Sword-Maiden? How did she get here? Was she some peasant girl whose parents were guards or legion and she followed in their footsteps, and impressed the local nobility? Was she just some Judy Hopps type of girl who really wanted to be a warrior, trained herself, and caught the Court of Solitude\u2019s eye? Was she an adventurer and hero herself, perhaps becoming Housecarl after Torygg\u2019s death? Is she close to Elisif? Was she herself nobility, perhaps even related to Elisif or Torygg? Was she some orphan raised her whole life to be a Housecarl? Was she just some cute guard given to you as a reward? Was she a natural prodigy given her age and skill? A handmaiden to Elisif herself? \n\nWhat about her being assigned to you? You\u2019re the Thane of one of the most powerful Holds, and owning a luxury manor. Does Jordis being assigned to you have any significance? Even if she is strong for her age, in comparison to the Dragonborn and the man who stopped Potema, wouldn\u2019t she be more like an apprentice if not outright squire? Is that why Elisif assigned her to you, because she knew you\u2019d be better off with a loyal yet competent sidekick? Was she assigned to keep an eye on you? \n\nThen again, if she\u2019s supposed to be loyal to Solitude and Elisif, she\u2019s not doing a good job, as she can help the Stormcloaks attack her own Hold! Ulfric, the man who killed her King and the husband of her current Jarl, and is warring against them! Is she not loyal to them, or only to you? Does she have hidden motivations? Is she star struck by the Dragonborn? She certainly strikes me as so. \n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that Jordis, in my experience, is EXTREMELY violent and aggressive in battle. She violently murders people, insults them by saying they\u2019re not true nords and bringing up their race. Then she goes back to being sweet around you, potentially as a doting wife and mother. What an adorable racist psychopath. There\u2019s definitely a lot of character possibility here. \n\nLol I know there is literally no information about her whatsoever, but I think her weird spot as the young Housecarl of Haafingar, and her possible connection to Torygg and Elisif, has a lot of fun headcannon possibilities. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Who is the Sword-Maiden of Solitude?"

                "body": "By the time Delphine reveals herself to be a Blade, the Dragonborn has not only already visited the Greybeards, and is retrieving the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller to be named Ysmir, he is already on the path to meet Parthurnaax. Between Parthurnaax and Arngeir, the Dragonborn will literally have everything he needs to save the world: The Blades are completely useless and unnecessary from a writing perspective. Some of their quests are neat, but ultimately *completely unnecessary to the actual plot.*\n\nSo first, Delphine fucking drags you to Kynesgrove where you see Alduin revive a dragon. Which is neat and explains how it comes back. But this is literally something that Parthurnaax or Arngeir could have said, or seen on your own (And you can!). The only reason you learn it alongside Delphine is because she\u2019s distracting you with her stupid mission. Why would you work with Delphine, who knows literally nothing, when you could just be patient and work with the Greybeards, who actually have the knowledge to help you and make you stronger, as well as about the dragons in general?\n\nThen, Delphine takes you to the Thalmor Embassy. A fun mission which has one purpose: To discover Esbern. I actually like Esbern, he\u2019s much better then Delphine. The thing is, Esbern has one purpose, and one purpose only: Alduin\u2019s Wall.\n\nThe thing is, Alduin\u2019s Wall is pointless. It exists for two reasons: To have a prophecy (Which to be honest, could have been carved into High Hrothgar, remembered verbally, or simply not exist) and to reveal Dragonrend. But the thing is, that prophecy is not at all necessary to know, it doesn\u2019t change anything, and eventually, Arngeir or Parthurnaax would have told you about Dragonrend anyway, because they knew about it, and they had no other method of defeating Alduin.\n\nNow, the Blade side quests where you kill dragons are fun, but not necessary. You\u2019d think the faction that is supposed to be loyal to the Dragonborn, who call themselves Dragonslayers and are in the middle of a Dragon Crisis, would actually help you directly fight Alduin. Perhaps help trap Odahviing, or fight alongside you when you go to Blackreach or Skulfadn. But they don\u2019t! There are only three fucking times they are ever relevant again:\n\nEsbern (And note, Esbern is the ONLY Blade that\u2019s fucking useful) can help you three times:\n\nIn Elder Knowledge, you can (Optionally) ask him about the Elder Scroll. But you can also talk to Parthurnaax and Arngeir about it. \n\nIn The Fallen, you can talk to Arngeir, Parthurnaax, and Esbern about trapping Odahviing. Again, Esbern is unnecessary.\n\nAnd finally, in Season Unending, first when he can suggest a peace talk (Guess the other two characters who can do the same) and later in the quest, he has some dialogue where he tells everyone to shut up and focus on the Dragons. One, Season Unending is an optional quest. Two, you could give this line of dialogue to Balgruuf (The guy who actually needs everyone to stop fighting) Arngeir, or you. \n\nThe Blades only helpful contributions to the main quest are literally Esbern talking, which can be done by two other characters who are literally closer to you. There is no reason whatsoever to go to Sky Haven Temple to talk to Esbern when it literally takes less time to walk the Throat of the World. \n\nEsbern makes some neat anti dragon potions and you can get Dragonsbane. And that\u2019s it. Not an entirely loyal faction with Dragonbone and Scale armor and weapons. Without mods, the Blades are a senile old man, a paranoid middle aged woman, and the three followers you think would best benefit from Blades gear, mercs you don\u2019t want to spend money on, or followers you want to keep in one spot. \n\nSo in conclusion, Esbern, Delphine, and the Blades are completely USELESS to the plot of Skyrim. All of the Blades quests are useless distractions who actually prevented you from solving the Dragon Crisis sooner. They literally have you go from Riverwood, to Kynesgrove, to Solitude, to fucking Riften, to the fucking Reach, when in that time you could have just gotten the Horn, taken it to Arngeir, and learned everything from the Parthurnaax. You literally travel more distance in these Blades missions then you do in the rest of the main quest COMBINED. \n\nSo what happens in a world without the Blades?\n\nThe Dragonborn gets the Horn. He takes it to Arngeir. The Greybeards dub him Ysmir and permit him to meet Parthurnaax. If he is not yet worthy for whatever reason, he does some more trials. Either way, he meets Parthurnaax. \n\nBetween Parthurnaax and Arngeir, the Dragonborn spends his time honing his Thuum, and with the help of the Greybeards is given many locations for more Shouts, and he fights dragons along the way. It\u2019s possible that at one point, you stumble on a Dragon Burial Mound near and discover Alduin is reviving dragons. Which Parthurnaax or Arngeir could have told you, instead of Delphine irrationally thinking it\u2019s the Thalmor. \n\nAlduin\u2019s Wall could have been a prophecy remembered by Parthurnaax or Arngeir, or discovered from them. But it\u2019s a useless prophecy that doesn\u2019t mean or change anything. It could have actually been in the Elder Scroll! Eventually, one or both of them reveals Dragonrend, because eventually you will inevitably ask \u201cHow did we defeat Alduin?\u201d and they reveal Dragonrend, as you have literally no other method of defeating Alduin. They tell you about the Elder Scroll, and from there you find it. From there, you fight Alduin the first time, then get the idea of trapping Odahviing, and potentially the peace talks. From Odahviing you learn where Alduin is hiding. Then you kill him. \n\nIn conclusion: If you completely removed the Blades from the main story, you\u2019d finish it in half the time and with a lot less headaches. The Blades are poorly written, and completely fucking useless to the plot of Skyrim. \n\nAny philosophical and ideological arguments would be better with Arngeir and Parthurnaax as well, since not only are those two actually interesting, likable, competent, helpful, and relevant to the story, with actually interesting beliefs, but the Blades beliefs have been widely criticized by the audience for years, along with them just not compelling or important enough characters to contrast the Greybeards. Literally the entire main quest would be better and flow more coherently if the Blades were removed entirely. Instead of multiple unnecessary missions traveling around Skyrim doing useless shit, we could have spent it on High Hrothgar training our Thuum and actually learning relevant Dragon Lore. I seriously want to strangle whoever wrote this mangled and mutilated faction beyond repair, they are a complete and total failure of writing and a blight on the already criticized main quest. But at least having the focus on Arngeir and Parthurnaax instead of the dumbass Blades would make it bearable and actually have relevant focus on being the Dragonborn and learning the Thuum, THE FUCKING PREMISE OF THE GAME THAT SKYRIM COULDN'T EVEN DELIVER ON. \n\nWhat a waste of Max Von Sydow."

I enjoy roasts that accurately capture a true downside of my personality, and ones that play with something that is so far from my real personality that it's glaringly obvious. I'm not sure if I could enjoy this variety, that takes something someone posted, discards what they were actually saying, and turns it into fodder for satire with a completely different target in mind.

Stylistically speaking I'm confident, but as for types of garments that exist for this purpose, I feel at a loss because I've never paid any attention to this!\n\nI sleep in my panties and always have, but clearly that won't work in this situation with a male friend. So, I'm looking for responses that would shed light on what kinds of options for sleepwear are out there, that people actually like wearing, and some pros and cons of each option.\n\nI'm looking for something fairly modest and comfortable, while still feminine. The reason I usually sleep in underwear is that I dislike getting wrapped up in layers of fabric, but I guess that can't be totally avoided when the aim is to cover myself up. What do you guys think would be the best solutions here?\n\n \n\nEDIT:\n\nThanks to everyone who explained their sleepwear choices like I asked and were able to get over the fact that I dislike pajamas. I have ADHD and autism traits, which means I\u2019m genuinely at risk of missing what is and isn\u2019t appropriate for this occasion - hence I wanted to ask a bunch of people to get a broad range of replies. The related sensory processing issues are no walk in the park either, so it is truly worth it to try and come up with the best possible solution for me.\n\nTo those who didn\u2019t even try to get it, and proceeded to cast me as a humblebragging greige-dresser elsewhere on Reddit: I truly had no clue that it would be this triggering for some people to say I dress younger than the statistical norm for my age, or that I live in Europe, but I guess that\u2019s due to my social blindness. I hope the snickering, word-twisting and bashing me based on my Reddit history has helped you feel at least a bit better about yourselves, for a moment. \n\nHave a good day, everyone!"

I'm going through intense work stuff that eats the major part of my concentration, and I have ADD which makes it a challenge to combine that with dating. When we met, I wasn't active in dating and I explained this to him, and suggested we take it slow. He accepted and it's been going great.\n\nWe're facetiming once a week and sending the occasional text in the time between. He has some anxiety which got worse some time ago, and I had a temporary relief in my work schedules, so I offered to do an additional facetime that week, which he accepted. I also offered the chance to communicate less, because I know some people need to withdraw socially when struggling, but I guess he is one who benefits from more frequent social interaction because he chose the opposite option. I then suggested the same again later, when there was some room in my schedule. After that we've gone back to the once a week thing.\n\nSo, for some time now, all our meetings have been suggested/organised by me. The once per week is a recurring one, same time every week, so neither of us actually needs to bring it up every time, but it was my idea to start doing it. I don't mind being the one calling the shots and I'm happy with how things are (I'm getting my needs met perfectly), but I am a tad worried about whether or not his needs are being met, when he isn't assertively sharing them. I guess it's marginally possible that our needs simply happen to be very similar, but the more likely scenario is that he's holding back expressing his, whenever they differ from mine. I'd like to do whatever I can to steer us away from the consequences of that sort of imbalance, without overstepping and starting to live his life for him.\n\nSo, a question for anyone who cares to give it thought: what would be a good way to encourage him to express himself more directly? If you're someone who struggles with this, what would you like to hear your date say, that would make you feel more comfortable? I don't want to make it seem like I'll  be able to accommodate whatever it is he desires, every time, because I already know I won't be. However, I would like to know his heart's desires, because if I did, I might find ways to accommodate them that aren't even crossing my mind at the moment."

Not going to do that.\n\nThis person is my ex, whom I still care about in a non-romantic way. There are gaps in our understanding of what happened to us, and we've begun exchanging emails from time to time, in order to potentially learn something.\n\nOne of the things that has come up is that he resents me for having been overly controlling. A part of that I can understand, as I do have routines and processes that I'm inflexible about (they're there for the purpose of managing my ADHD and therefore not purely selfish, but this was hard for him to understand sometimes). However, there is now a new twist to this topic, as he started to say I was also controlling our sex life: \"Whenever you decided, I should be ready to provide sex.\" My experience is quite the opposite. He wanted sex way more often than me and initiated it much more, and we were also having it a lot. I truly and deeply enjoyed every time, and it didn't take much to get me in the mood, even if I wasn't feeling it enough to initiate myself. During the two years, I declined physical intimacy only one time because I was dead tired after a long day at work, and even that time he managed to get me in the mood anyway, soon after. I am 100% certain that I have never pressured or coerced him to do anything against his will, so I was quite baffled at this comment.\n\nMost of the relationship was long distance, and online sex isn't very satisfying for me, so those times I kind of forced it upon myself more. For that same reason, I also declined more frequently. I tried to find a balance between feeling like it's a chore (risking a decreasing libido the more I felt that way), and him feeling left out.\n\nWhen I asked for clarification, he explained that my declining was a controlling act that I did not have the right to do. He doesn't seem to grasp the concept that nobody is obligated to force something unpleasant on themselves, just to serve someone else. He seems to believe that in the same way that we are obligated to not inflict unpleasant things/behaviour on others, we are also equally obligated to engage in behaviour we don't want to engage in, in case the absence of that behaviour is hurtful to someone else. I didn't even know it's possible to have such a belief, as for me these two things are clearly very different! I'm just struggling to find words to describe what exactly the difference is. Is there some kind of term/name for that that I can suggest he look up?\n\nI want him to have success in his next relationship, and I would truly like to help him understand where this thinking goes wrong, and that he is certainly not entitled to resent someone for refusing to have sex with him. Not even if he is in a relationship with that person.\n\nConstructive replies only, please."

No kids.\n\nI broke up with my ex around two years ago. It was my first toxic relationship (it lasted two years), and I had no idea how to handle it. Once it was over I realised I was probably codependent, and got myself into therapy. I was diagnosed with severe depression and it took around a year to get myself back together again. At the time, I was feeling positive and hopeful about everything, although I still had  my career related difficulties to sort out before it would be wise to start dating again, and eventually settle down.\n\nThen the pandemic hit. I lost most of my hobbies, most human contact (I work from home), my career has gone down the toilet even worse than before, and during the pandemic my family has started to fall apart one by one, physically and mentally. My therapist tells me to not blame that on myself, and to not try too hard to help, because in the end it's them who must to sort out their own problems, and I should focus on sorting out mine. She's right. I was also recently diagnosed with ADHD, learning to cope with that at the moment.\n\nI've been quite proud of the fact that I no longer feel an active need to contact my ex. The relationship was of the \"too good to be true\" variety, so it was super hard to stop daydreaming of all the good things we had. I processed these feelings endlessly, reached a more realistic idea of my ex, and I am now more scared than interested when it comes to staying in touch with him. \n\nWe haven't been in contact in over a year, but recently he sent me a text and we chatted for a bit. He said he misses me, he's coming to my country August this year and is about to move closer permanently (he currently lives on another continent). He asked me to keep in touch. I didn't respond to that, just thought to myself: \"I won't\".\n\nI've been feeling under the weather lately. I feel like if it wasn't for the pandemic, my career troubles might be sorted out by now. I might be having fun with my friends, getting to know new people, living life. If this was the case, I'd probably want absolutely nothing to do with my ex. But the way things are, I'm almost exactly where I was when we broke up. It's been two years. I'm feeling like I'm such a failure for not getting ahead more.\n\nI feel like I'm losing my identity as an artist. Not being able to work kind of makes me forget what I'm about. My friendships have been reduced to talking over the phone and the occasional chats. The spare time activities I used to do to keep myself sane, I can't do because everything is closed. Essentially I feel lonely and imprisoned, physically, socially and professionally.\n\nI recognise there is a risk I end up contacting my ex in the hopes of getting emotional support from him, even though I know he isn't capable of giving that. I don't want to burden my friends too much, so I hold a lot of this back when I talk to them, even though they are always supportive when I open up. My family absolutely cannot emotionally support me right now, and they were never very good at it anyway tbh.\n\nSo I guess the reason I wrote this endless ramble is to just vent to someone that isn't my ex. I hate that he still feels the most intimately connected person to me in existence, just because there hasn't been a chance to get to know new people. I know I can't cave in and start talking to him again, or else the progress I've made will be eroded.\n\nTL;DR: **So could you peeps just simply talk with me? Anyone else experiencing something similar? Share your best coping tips, regarding the pandemic, dating, messy life situation, difficult ex partners etc.**"

                "body": "My dog, Cookie, was attacked today by an Australian Cattle Dog named Sam. Luckily she only has a small cut on her lips. What makes this incident worse is the dog owner himself, Jon.\n\nTo give more light on the situation, I was walking Cookie at the local park. She started barking at Sam from a distance who was approaching us very shortly. I grabbed Cookie's harness and planted her firmly by my feet for Jon and his dogs to walk by. As they start walking past us, Sam decides to jump on my leg to get to Cookie. My leg wasn't hurt but Cookie did start bleeding near her mouth. I didn't notice the bleeding until a minute later and started running back towards Jon. As I was running, I was exclaiming \"Excuse me! Excuse me!\" so he would hear me. Jon noticed I was running towards him and he decided to start running away from me too. His dogs didn't run though so he was forced to talk to me to which I told him that Sam attacked my dog. He said, \"So? What do you want from me?\" I said I wanted his information, and he said \"Nope. I'm not giving it because your dog started it by barking and bit herself\" I was shocked. I held my dog down by my foot and Sam had jumped on me to get to her. \n\nJon proceeds to walk away but I monitored his every move from a distance so I can keep track where he went. He was smart in that he maneuvered one way but completely changed direction shortly after to throw me off. He didn't think I noticed but I did. After that, I ran home and got into my car with my mom and bolted off to find him. Because I assessed the situation very quickly, I was able to pin Jon down. We got into an argument and I called the cops explaining the situation. \n\nWhile waiting for the cops, Jon proceeds to say things like he doesn't care about my dog. A local neighbor comes out and tries to diffuse the situation by siding with Jon by saying he's a kid (Jon is a 20 year old in college and I'm 6 years older than him). Jon even said that he didn't act wisely because he was going through personal stuff. I never believe that excuse because everyone goes through personal stuff. Regardless, the cops come and get both of our statements. They called Animal Control as well who assessed that the situation wasn't severe, to which I agree.\n\nThe reason this situation makes me angry is because Jon didn't take accountability when it happened. He started running away from me and even tried to blame my dog for the attack by barking and saying that she bit her own mouth which caused the bleeding. Sam wasn't injured in the situation at all either. He even said that he didn't care about my dog at all. Regardless, I'm glad I was able to pin him down and start a police report. This way he'll learn to act more humanely. It's times like these when I really question humanity despite my already thorough views on it."

I am interested in adopting a Syrian hamster next but I feel like the Machioro Goran 82 can be small for them. \n\nSide note: I 100% prefer wired cages for aesthetics but also for better ventilation. I noticed my Tater Tot didn't like detolf/bin-like cages because of less ventilation."

But then I saw you were decided on TR and neither this sub nor the SK sub allows suggesting an ID for others. For some time I started considered TR for myself too and tried padding more curves\ud83d\ude05. \n\nI had to give up on Gamine resistance too, as I too longed to look like a curvy or tall type. I finally started looking at my lines more objectively and found out I'm a petite pear with straight but narrow shoulders, slight bottom curve and none on the upper. I'm skinny but not angular or muscular, rather soft and delicate.\n\nIt's been fairly recent that I have settled on my ID and I hope to use this revelation to my best benefit. I'm just having a hard time trying to match my essence (Romantic, dramatic, ethereal) with the Gamine lines. Very few inspos out there. \ud83d\ude05\n\nThank you so much for sharing your wonderful journey. Hope you have the best times ahead \ud83d\udc95",

I'm sorry you became addicted to harmful things. I'm sorry you let past partners treat you like you were nothing and confirm all of the nonsense you believed about yourself. All of the things you were told or believed are untrue. And for that, I'm sorry you were never aware of this. I don't see someone who is ugly, worthy of abuse, manipulation, hurting. I don't see someone who can't cope or deal with things. You are strong. You are beautiful. You are intelligent, hilarious, creative, weird (in a great way), the most caring and kind person I have possibly ever known. You deserve to be told these things. Not just because I care for you, but because I believe them to be the truth. \n\nI'm sorry for what I do too. I am scared of losing you and I'm scared of hurting you. I wasn't taught how to behave properly and I try to learn. Some days I want more attention than other days. Some days I'm more scared. Some days I worry you'll stop loving me. I'm sorry I can be a jerk. I don't mean to be. I don't know how to handle loving a person this much. I want to help you through things and see you through to health and happiness and be by your side for all of it. I know I'm bad at communicating and I get stuck on things. Lately I've felt bad about myself because I feel like I keep messing up with you. \n\nAnd right now, I'm writing this to you because you aren't speaking to me, but you're on my mind. And I'm hurting deeply while I write this. Being so far away from you kills me. Hearing you tell me you think you'll let me down or disappoint me makes me ache over the fact that you don't see yourself the way I see you. \n\nYou're everything in the world to me. I want to wake up and see you. I want to go to sleep and see you. I want to bake in the middle of the night and watch movies afterwards with you. You make me laugh harder than anyone I know. Your intelligence never ceases to amaze me. You have a beautifully patient way of handling me. I didn't believe in a soul mate or true love before I knew you. And now you're the person I want to tell everyone I know about. I want to gush over how great I find you, every time I get the chance to. I could live the rest of my days doing the most mundane things with you and never feel bored. I'd never be without laughter. And I'd never be without love. \n\nDespite everything I've gone through in my life though, it's you who I feel needs the love more than me. You need to know plain and simple that I find you perfect. I know you hurt often and that I'm not the softest person. And I'm quite wounded. But you have to hear me when I tell you these things. I can't see my life without you anymore. Every thought of my future has you in it. \n\nYou were just my friend at one time. And I thought you were extraordinary then. As we got closer, you never knew you became my best friend. You never knew I talked to you everyday more than I talked to anyone I knew. I did everything I could to make sure I could spend time with you. And as I learned who you were, I fell in love with you. And eventually I got lucky enough to tell you I loved you, even though you didn't know how I meant it. Every time my feelings developed more, somehow I had to tell you. And every time that happened, I felt more at home with you. Now you are home for me. You're what makes me feel comfortable and happy and safe, despite my moments of doubt. I ask you just to forgive my irrational thought when I'm doubtful and insecure. One day I will learn to better handle those things. But please know I am trying. I'm doing everything I can to make being with you work, forever. \n\nI don't want this to sound like I'm telling you how much I love you. I want this to be a clear message that I'm aware of how often I screw up. And I'm sorry. I don't want to cause more pain to you. You've suffered enough. I just want to tell you, if there is anything you take away from this, that I can't stand to see you hurt still. I hope we get through all of these rough bits of life and can move on and be happy and healthy. \n\nAll my love,\nSP"

He's got loads of interesting traits and habits, but I can't wrap my head around how he acts when he's got to take a poop. \n\nSometimes he meows while pawing through his litter box when he's looking for a place to settle and poop. Other times he doesn't. But he has a consistent habit of covering his poop and crouching down in his litter box and then taking off running. He yowls while he runs and then he'll prance around chirruping while he chases me. Or hell run and hide under a box I leave out for him and then fly out of it and run all over even more. He slides all over the floor because it's tile and he seems to be excitable and happy. But...I can't seem to find anyone who relates to their cat going totally insane after he poops. \n\nDoes anyone's cat do some similar? Or know what the heck is going on? Curiosity is, in fact, killing me."

It reframes how we understand judging and perceiving and what functions land in that category. It is a very important post and it is short and simple. Read it and give it the noise it deserves.\n\nI've been putting off writing about Te PoLR because I have the least experience with it. In any case, I'll give it a shot.\n\nTe PoLR means you are disinclined toward and likely bad at taking the most effective steps to reach a particular goal. Look at it in opposition to auxiliary Fe.\n\nTake a group project. Here, Te's priority is to complete the project, and its default mode of interaction will pertain to that goal. Fe's priority is to make sure everyone feels valuable to the group and is satisfied with their own contribution. Fe focuses on the \"team\" in teamwork. Te focuses on the \"work\". In both cases, one diminishes the other but also is assisted by it. A successful project boosts everyone's individual satisfaction, and a happy group will lead to a better project. At the same time, a Te user's authoritative, intense, efficiency-based approach may not lead to a harmonious environment, and an Fe user's focus on harmony may prevent the necessary steps from being accomplished.\n\nFe tool, as in Te PoLR, prioritizes Fe maximally, more than any other type. They'll make sure everyone's feeling alright and perhaps forget that steps need to be taken, and all this social managing may be slowing things down too much.\n\nOn a more individual level, Te PoLR may simply be very bad at things that require them to figure out a step-by-step process. Trying to fix something, or constructing an IKEA bed, will perplex them without the proper help. Essentially, interacting with the world in a way where only the physical, practical outcomes are relevant, as opposed to the human, social ones (where meaning lies in symbolism and affect\u2014can you see the contrast?) is distressing, and will seem unimportant when it's not explicitly required.\n\nI wish I had some proper anecdotes for this. It's sort of a shot in the dark. I always ask for your disagreements and elaborations, but in this case, they'll be especially appreciated. I hope this gave you some insight. That's that for the blind spots!"

Even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there, like a string in a maze, so that you shall not lose your way. For existence has its own order and that no man's mind can compass, that mind itself being but a fact among others.\"\n\nPerhaps this doesn't *exactly* align with a pantheistic view but I find it hits extremely hard and it was one of the things that initially provoked me into recognizing the sheer absurdity of things. The specificity of what we (humans) is here now, having emerged somehow over time, is crazy and beautiful. Intelligence/consciousness is a certain extreme manifestation of nature's capabilities, and I'm here for all the insanity that it produces.

Si PoLR (ENxJs possess it) is certainly a very strange one to have or witness. There's something a bit non-human about it, and it makes sense that I see it that way because according to stats it is the rarest by quite a decent margin.\n\nLet me show to you what Ni and Si are. Take a thing. From this thing, Si gathers all the qualities that are specific to it. Ni gathers all of the general truths and patterns that it represents. Si sees a person and sees his/her specific behavioral and physical characteristics and idiosyncrasies, and sees those things as unique to that person. Ni sees in that individual a general archetype, a certain sort of person that they've seen in other places in different ways. What is a young, confident, muscular man who likes to play sports to an Si user can simply be a \"jock\" to an Ni user (though these categorizations probably won't be this concrete in the Ni user's mind).\n\nBoth are absolutely necessary, for everyone. You have to be able to see things contextually and put them in categories (Ni). A certain bicycle can't just be identified as a construction of different parts that looks a certain way, it also has to be categorized, instinctively, as one bicycle among many others, and as a vehicle, and as whatever else one could relate it to other things with. At the same time, there has to be space to be able to identify things as unique things that stand on their own at least in some way. A family member has to be YOUR family member, with all of his/her distinctive qualities, not just another person. Si is sort of how attachment is created to yourself and things.\n\nHaving either as a PoLR functions simply means you represent an extreme side of the spectrum that emphasizes these functions as little as possible while still being a functional human being.\n\nSi PoLR sees things in what can be generalized from them. They will often come to a broad understanding about something, without being able to point to a specific example that demonstrates that understanding. They may know \"Beth and Andy argue a lot\" and can come to further conclusions about the nature of Beth and Andy's relationship, but may also be stumped if you ask them for a specific time that that happened. It is because when they witnessed all of those arguments, what they gathered was not the specific argument at hand, which on an instinctual level is completely irrelevant to them, but whatever can be understood about Beth and Andy and their relationship from that argument.\n\nThere are other characteristics, but this is the gist. An over-reliance on the general, disregarding the specific.\n\nThis is where the forward moving stereotype comes from for ENxJs. In addition to seeing things outside of themselves in this general manner, their understanding of themselves is also not particularly grounded or static. A specific experience won't usually change how they view themselves or something, and so they can easily get past it, and thus they'll also not really have a constructed self-identity that comes from an amalgamation of their past experiences to the same extent that others do (and are so attached to). My ENFJ step mom once told me that she hasn't been single for longer than a couple of weeks since age 15 or so. For an Si user, a past relationship has enough impact that it affects their ability to move onto a new one. For an ENxJ, they see it as something that has past and that thus no longer has any meaningful impact in their lives. They'll see it as a \"relationship\" just like any other, that has certain general qualities that can be replicated with other individuals, rather than something that was irreplaceable in its specificities. Not that emotion are attachment are non-existent for Si PoLR's, but things will be easier to get past.\n\nThis stereotype also fits with a general unawareness of the body. Comfort and pain and such things. They can keep going with out realizing how their physical state is being compromised until much after. I'm not sure how consistent this is for ENxJs but its something that I've generally observed to be true and it makes a lot of sense.\n\nI could go into it more but this is all I feel like writing for now. Come at me with your follow up questions, disagreements or general comments. Thanks for the read."

Seriously. I've not read any science on this phenomenon, but there probably is some. Either way, I know it's true. Everything is so quick, and visually and mentally stimulating. People know can absorb far more information per second than people in the past could, and as a result of this have much less patience for reading and many of the other simpler pleasures in life, especially if there's no phone around to check every once in a while.\n\nYeah, the checking. Hate that shit. Hate that I do it and hate that other people do it. Happens during movies, out in nature, and worst of all in social settings. The ever-contempted \"kids are always looking at their phones\" may be annoying but it's sorta true. I find it sad to see phones be such a default for people, and to think about how much more could come out of other things if they weren't around.\n\nIf you want to use a smartphone, fine. They are extremely useful, and I understand why most people would keep theirs. They have clear objective benefits, but I believe are problematic on an individual level. I still have mine, though I am considering getting rid of it."

When the skill was extended, fruit trees were added up to a very high level, but standard trees were ignored.\n\nMagic trees are a level 75 tree. Yes, technically Elder Trees can be farmed, but there is only one eligible patch for this purpose. Maybe there aren't any high-level \"standard trees\" above this, but we could stand to be a little creative, as [even Old School has plantable hardwoods.](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Mahogany_seed) Being able to plant teaks and mahoganies would save ironmen a bit of a headache (or at least a few hours of PvM), even if they were considered very high level trees. I know that bamboo is technically a grass, but we don't have to let the botany majors know. Achey trees, eucalyptus, arctic pine, etc. may not have valuable produce, but in a pinch, their seeds could also be made available. Anything to bring tree runs back from extinction.\n\nTYFCTMTT."

It is faster to disassemble items than to individually right-click each one or to drag them out. If we are never getting this action bar fix, please at least allow us to discard items more expeditiously. Drop-X, Drop all? Anything.\n\nDropping things isn't the only problem, but it is a lot more annoying on the mobile client. Additionally, there are numerous items that don't behave the way a player might expect them to when placed on an action bar. Unequipping a piece of gear, for example, should always be prioritized over viewing its perks. "

I have quite a lot of small cysts and believe it to be at least partially genetic. \nFor the numbness problem, I think seeing a family doctor for peace of mind would be good, that way you can tell yourself there is no rational reason to worry, if everything turns out to be fine. If there is a pattern to when and how it occurs, I think it would be beneficial to mark them down, so when you see a doctor you can quickly and accurately describe its characteristics.",

                "body": "**How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nAlmost 25, male. Best described as former gifted child turned digital hermit (and you can probably guess the two types I'm trying to figure out my way between from that one alone.)\n\n**Is there a medical diagnosis that impact your mental/comportamental stability somehow?**\n\nNo, not that I ever sought one out. There's a small bouquet of ones I'd check out the superficial symptoms for - Asperger's being the most visible - but it's hardly a professional opinion on my part... besides, if you've been this way your entire life, can it really be considered separate from your personality?\n\n**Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy family was mildly religious, but I never took to it (by which I mean I decided I don't believe in any of it while I was still in kindergarten and had no reservations about declaring it). The worst I had to deal with was the constant \"you'll change your mind when you're older, want to get married and she insists it's in a church\", and the time I interrupted the Adam and Eve story in religion class with an explanation of evolution is a long-running anecdote in my family now. Beyond that... well, as you could probably guess from the above, I learned to read at a very young age and pretty much spent all my time reading - encyclopaedias or fiction or my aunt's textbooks, all read cover to cover dozens of times, just no poetry, *thank you very much*. Was left to mind my own business, mostly - even if sometimes I do wish there was a bit more *teaching* of practical life skills rather than just expecting me to have already learned them when I got older.\n\n**What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nProgrammer. While time spans between jobs, being repeatedly told \"everyone's looking for programmers these days, it's easy to find a job\" when every single posting requires years of experience I don't have is frankly maddening, the actual work... well, my current arrangement is me having a clear to-do list to work through, basically only messaging one person to clarify the requirements (or sometimes a person who worked on the project earlier) and being left to handle things on my own without any distractions, and having firmly set hours I can be sure I won't be bothered after is basically *ideal* for me.\n\nIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nMoving out on my own and spending basically *all* my time outside work alone some time before the pandemic was some of the happiest times in my life, especially after being stuck in a one-room apartment with two other people up until then. A weekend, a week, even a month alone doesn't really bother me in and of itself - though I did start thinking I should try and reach out, last year. The rest of last year put that plan *firmly* on hold, and even now I've no particular problems with the idea of waiting for the vaccine (expected middle-late summer in my country, I think) before trying to reach out to the world.\n\n**What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event what is it? And why? If not what type of activities do you tend to engage in?**\n\nI've never felt any particular appreciation for pretty scenery, and while exercise can be somewhat fun when I'm new to it and noticing progress, once I've plateaued for a couple of months it becomes an unpleasant chore.\n\n**How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nCuriosity - depends on the subject matter, and how much I know about it already. I'll spend a fair bit of time reading commentaries and interpretations on fictional works I like, and I thoroughly enjoy figuring out something complex... but I tend to collect answers I come across more than I actually ask the questions.\n\n**Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**\n\nFrom experience, no I don't enjoy it. I'd end up in charge during group projects in school/university more often that not because I'd be the first one to start worrying about an impending deadline, and I prefer to just figure out what tasks need to be done, let people have their pick and cover what's left over (with some effort made to make sure the tasks I'm *least* suited to go to somebody else), and be there to help out others who can't quite figure things out on their own.\n\n**Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**\n\nI can trip while *standing still*. Not a fan of working with my hands, though I fidget a *lot*.\n\n**Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nThere was a time I would've said no, when my definition of \"art\" was mostly informed by school. I've found an appreciation for the less museum-style art found on the Internet, though, and I've even dabbled in creative writing (started with fanfiction, trying my hand at an original fantasy novel), so I'd say that yes, to some degree I am.\n\n**What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThe past... beyond a few scenes, my memory tends to be rather hazy. There are months-long spans of my life I couldn't bring up a specific memory from beyond the general idea of how I felt these days.  The present, I usually spend daydreaming unless there's something actually interesting enough to draw my attention. The future... depending on my mood, it's a vision of either a better life, or a worse one.\n\n**How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**\n\nDepends on the context. There's only so far I'm willing to go out of my way to help (and I hate imposing on others when I'm the one needing help), but I'll do what I can. As for why... well, if it's friends/family, it's because that's what friends and family are *supposed* to do. I don't really do much to help strangers out beyond give directions/hold doors open, not that it's something that comes up often, homebody that I am. I'd say it all comes down to an idea of fairness and recompense/paying it forward. The latter in particular seems to be a *thing* in my line of work - the recruiter at my current job, after asking what I'd expect my exact duties to be and me including \"helping newbies\" as a possibility once I have the experience, said *every* programmer she hires mentions that one, with the same \"somebody had to show me around, too\" reasoning.)\n\n**Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nTrying for it, yes, with the understanding true objectivity and consistency is impossible to achieve and you're always going to hit a \"because I want to/because I said so/etc.\" if you ask \"why?\" enough times.\n\n**How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\nI don't think it's a measure of my success in life in general, but *professionally* I do aim to be the kind of person who gets things done and doesn't make waves without reason.\n\n**Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nI don't think I do, no.\n\n**What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nConsuming media's the main one - video games, books, movies/shows, music. I just enjoy it, I suppose - and it frustrates me that even if I were immortal and had no need to work, eat, and sleep, I still wouldn't have the time to enjoy more than a tiny fraction of it. I've also done some writing, as I mentioned before - it's one part enjoying the process itself, one part reading the admiration of several hundred readers which would make it, in a way, the most \"me\" achievement - programming's fun, and a solid job, but how many people know or care about the programmer who fixed fifty bugs in their company's internal accounting system? Finally, learning languages - it's, in a way, one with a very strong feedback cycle, where I can tell I'm improving by how much more I understand of something, how much less I need to pause and check a dictionary or look up a translation. I probably overreached with three extra languages beyond the ones I've long since been fluent in, but I don't want to drop French after getting to the point of being able to hold a basic conversation, don't want to drop Russian after all the effort I put into it at school, and don't want to drop German because German metal's too awesome. Ah well.\n\n**What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nLearning's easiest for me when I can connect a concept and practical application. Hard sciences, math in particular (until college level, anyway) - that kind of thing. Twenty slides of equations without a single display of what they actually *mean* is... somewhat harder to keep track of. And if it's a soft science and I'm asked to come up with an essay about \"anything\" or a \"business idea\", I'll draw nothing but blanks until there's something more specific to latch on to.\n\n**How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nStrategizing in the sense of great vision... hard to *force* it to happen, and I have a bad habit of missing that one critical detail. I lean towards a large set of \"In case of A...\", \"In case of B...\", \"In case of C...\"\n\n**What's important to you and why?**\n\nThat's... a surprisingly difficult question. I could come up with platitudes like \"being the best person I can be\", \"understanding the world and applying that understanding\", but it rings somewhat hollow.\n\n**What are your aspirations?**\n\nAgain, as above, I can't really think of any overarching goals more complicated than \"enjoy life\". Which basically comes down to having more of what I like in it, and less of what I don't.\n\n**What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nThe main ones would be: physical harm, failure, being a burden on others, the inevitable decline of body and mind as this poorly-designed mortal form approaches its expiration date.\n\n**What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nTwo main flavors are triumph (whether it's cracking a complicated programming task, or realizing I just understood something in a foreign language I wouldn't have weeks or months ago, or just reaching a higher rank in a game) and entertainment (being absorbed in a really good book/movie, enjoying a game with a friend).\n\n**What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nA general feeling of \"why even bother, it's all doomed long-term anyway.\"\n\n**How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nUsually fairly far gone into a daydream, unless there's something interesting to focus on in reality (and even then I'll likely be paying little attention to anything else.) \n\n**Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nHow did I get here, how do I get out, how long until I go crazy in here, remember that experiment with people being left in a room with nothing but a button that gives them an electric shock to entertain themselves with?\n\n**How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nTakes a while, and while I'm willing to change if something new comes up, otherwise I'll consider it decided and not think on it further.\n\n**How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI don't really tend to feel intense emotions in the moment - if nothing else, because most of the time, if something's big enough that I'd feel strongly about it, I've probably already lived through it a dozen times in my imagination and basically dealt with it. (There's an obvious drawback here - what's that quote? \"I've experienced many tragedies - some of them even happened\"?)\n\n**Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nIf I'm faking agreement, it's because I want you to *stop* talking and can't just ghost you. If anything, I've had to ask myself *why am I arguing with a person I don't actually disagree with*. Including, in one case, arguing with a vegetarian classmate over that for fifteen minutes, *after* saying I'm not there to start an argument. Didn't notice how uncomfortable she seemed until well afterwards.\n\n**Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why would you?**\n\nI can't really recall a situation where that's come up, presuming you don't count breaking rules nobody follows anyway. In theory? Authorities and rules are fallible, but if they're *really* wrong you've got an uphill fight that may not be worth the effort, and it's important to remember that *you* can always be in the wrong too.\n\n**What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**\n\nI'm imagining a nice apartment where I can live with only a cat or two for company, a stable 9-5 (or shorter, you won't hear me complaining as long as the pay's good and the drama's scarce) job that leaves me a plenty of time and energy to pursue whatever catches my interest, and a few friends (and maybe a romantic partner) to reach out to break up the monotony every once in a while."

                "body": "So in our most recent Shadowrun 5e game, our group had 2 players who couldn't make it, but one new player.  That was okay.  It gave me a chance to test out some more improvisation chops.\n\nI went into the session with less than one page of notes and a printout of the rating 1-4 NPCs from the core book.  My notes were mostly the setup to get them to the meet, barebones info about the job, Mr. J's social pool (which I nerfed on the fly because the team's mage was missing) and which NPCs from the sheet to use for the run.  I had also intended to print out the specs for the truck I had picked out of Rigger 5.0, but I forgot to.  Oops.\n\nThe job: Collect a cargo transport truck that is traveling through the area and deliver it to a set of coordinates with the cargo and crew unharmed.  Oh, and this needs to be done *tonight*.\n\nThe new guy asks if being unconscious counts as \"harmed,\" and Mr. Johnson confirms that unconscious is acceptable.  The new guy then asks for a more clarified definition of \"unharmed\" and is told \"alive and not maimed.\"  Good questions from the newbie.\n\nDespite the lack of a face, the team manages to negotiate the payment up a bit, although nowhere near the potential maximum.  Good job mystic adept with Charisma as his drain stat.\n\nThe team leaves the meet and does some legwork.  They're able to figure out that the truck of interest is almost certainly going to have to stop to refuel somewhere in the Redmond Barrens.\n\nA little more legwork determines that there's really only one place in the barrens where a cargo truck is likely to be able to refuel.\n\nTheir plan: Fill up a couple of Jerry cans, then disable the fuel pumps at the truck stop, disable the truck's crew and any security, then fill the truck from the Jerry cans and take it to where it needs to go.  Good plan.\n\nSo they pick up a couple of Jerry cans, go to the truck stop, and fill them up.\n\nBefore they go about shutting down the fuel supply, they realize that none of them can drive a truck.  So the new guy decides that he's going to look for the most down-on-his-luck looking trucker he can find and offer him 500 nuyen to drive the truck for them, no questions asked.\n\nI'm totally yes, anding this.  I let him find a guy willing to do the work.  Enter Rapid Roy.  He's totally down to get this easy 500 nuyen.  That's sorted.\n\nThe crew looks for a way to shut off the fuel (manual override on the outside of the gas station).  This alerted the store clerk, who was about to intercept them when the mage did magey bullshit (Control Thoughts) and the clerk pulled the fire alarm and ran a fire drill instead, which distracted everyone nearby.\n\nFinally, the truck they're after pulls up...to the electric charging station rather than the diesel pumps.  This was not me fucking with the party.  The truck is specced in Rigger 5.0 as being an EV.  They just never asked, and I thought it would be funnier not to tell them.  It was...well, it was to me, anyway.\n\nNew guy gets close enough to the convoy to make the jammer in his suit effective while the team comes up with a plan.\n\nSo the team decides they need to shut down the power.  Except that the breaker panel is inside.  So the mage wanders inside and kills the power by flipping the master breaker.  Realistically speaking, I would expect the EV chargers to be on their own power supply, but I figured I'd let the runners have this one.\n\nThe new guy, who is a street sam decked out in military grade battle armor (he spent the karma on a quality that made it legal), was staked out close to the convoy.  When the power went out, he went up and bullshitted them into thinking he was additional security for the convoy.  He edged the roll and beat the NPC.\n\nHe tries to get them to roll the convoy out.  Driver of the security vehicle basically says \"Can't.  Need to charge.  Get the power back on and we'll get rolling ASAP.\"\n\nWithout missing a beat, the new guy says \"I'm not walking into an obvious ambush on my own.  Come with me.\"\n\nThe guy he's talking to says \"I have to stay with the truck, but I can send these guys with you,\" and sends the other 3 guys in the van with him.\n\nNew guy leads the guards into the store and then directs them to fan out into separate rooms.  To them, he seems to be in charge and know what he's doing, so they listen.\n\nStunbolt is overpowered, and the party's mage (technically a mysad, and one of two on the run, but that's beside the point) uses that to his advantage to knock one of the guards out.  The other two party members exchange some gunfire with their respective guards, some of which is silenced, most of which is not.\n\nThey then switch the power back on and new guy goes out to tell the head guard that the ambush is taken care of, power is back on, but that his guys were taken out in the process, and they need to get this truck moving right *now*.\n\nThe remaining guard would love to, but there's something wrong with comms (because new guy never said anything about turning his jammer *off*).  So the guard does it the old-fashioned way: He gets out, goes back, and talks to the driver of the truck.\n\nHe then gets back in the van and tries to drive off.  Huh...something's wrong with the van and it doesn't want to go very fast.  WTF?  Unbeknownst to the driver, mageboy had summoned a spirit (spirits are OP, y'all) and had it using a service to slow the van down (the Movement power can do that).  And the truck won't leave its security detail.\n\nNew guy says \"Fine.  Get on my motorcycle.  We need to get moving.\"  Guard is like \"You're right.  Let's go.\"  The rest of the team follows.\n\nThey get out away from the station a little way and decide to ambush the truck.  New guy pretends there's something wrong with his bike and pulls it over.  Guard says \"I've got to keep this moving.  Fix your bike and catch up.  I'm getting in the truck.\"\n\nMage spots the guy and does what mages do.  This guy happens to also be a mage and tries to counterspell it.  He got 4 hits on his counterspelling test.  Too bad the party's mage got a lot of net hits anyway.  Down he goes.\n\nNew guy (I really need to start calling him street sam instead of new guy) goes to the truck and tries to intimidate the driver, who just backs into the inbuilt rigger cocoon and starts to drive.  The other occupant of the truck shoots him with a flamethrower that's mounted on the truck.  \n\nFlamethrowers are kinda OP when you don't do well on your defense test.  You know what's even more OP?  Military power armor.  He's fine.\n\nSo street sam is clinging to the side of this truck that's now driving off and has run over their now unconscious guard (the party checked on him, he's injured, but he'll live) because they're gonna get the fuck out of here.  Street sam rocks his gymnastics and gets into the truck.  Hrm...manual controls inaccessible while driver in rigger cocoon.  Well, shit.\n\nParty's mage has a different idea...and spirit services left.  Suddenly, the truck slows down.  They're able to catch it easily.  I haven't talked much about the third party member.  He's a combat medic.  He hasn't had much combat medic-ing to do, so he's been playing chauffer.\n\nHe pulls ahead of the truck, stops, and out steps Rapid Roy, who is bitching about having to catch *another* truck on foot.  Not that it's hard because spirits are OP.  It's just a bit more than the initial job description let on, y'know?\n\nSo Roy gets in the truck looks around and says that there's nothing he can do with these guys in the rigger cocoons.  Figure a way to get them out and he can roll this rig wherever they want it to go.\n\nThe street sam asks how to open a rigger cocoon and Roy says \"Well, I found the emergency release.  Problem is, if I try to open it, they'll just override me.\"  (Is that true?  I have NFC.  I'm making this up as I go.)\n\nDid I mention that stunbolt is OP?  Did I mention that spirits are OP?  Y'all, spirits that know how to cast stunbolt are OP, and my MysAd player is a dick.  I mean, I wouldn't have stopped him from doing this even if I could.  I'm just saying, stunbolt + spirit = OP^(2).\n\nSo now the crew of the rig is unconscious and Roy is able to open up the driver's cocoon and take manual control of the rig (again, I'm making this up as I go, so if this violates RAW, give me the relevant book references so I can do it right in the future).\n\nRoy drives the truck where it needs to go, the party pays him a 100 nuyen bonus and pays for his cab back to the truck stop.\n\nThe party leaves the truck where they were asked to leave it and heads out.  They each receive their payments by sun-up."

They asked no other questions, and they left.\n\nThey then started doing legwork to try to find the guy they were supposed to shake down for info.\n\nFor those of you who run your players through this module, you're probably all going \"Wait.  What?\"\n\nYeah.\n\nThere's nothing in the module on how the players can find this guy through doing their own legwork.  But that's the route my players went.\n\nSo I made up a gym that the guy is supposed to frequent, and the players went there to scope it out.  The party decides to send the total newbie in to scope this guy out.  So I made the front desk person at the gym interrupt the player and make him buy a membership before he could go in.\n\nPlayer spots the guy, contacts the team when the guy leaves, and the team tails him to McHugh's.  And from there, shenanigans ensued.\n\nBecause of that little diversion, we managed to turn the Quick Start module that I expected to be an hour, two at most, into a full session.\n\nAfter the session, my most experienced player, who knew we were running the Quick Start module, but hadn't read it, asked me if the gym was in the module.  I admitted that the gym was a total fabrication that I made up solely because they decided to do their own legwork, which the module didn't plan for."

I mean, honestly, who does that? It's brutal, it's messy, and it's not even reliably lethal. Every sapient knows that the most dangerous and consistently lethal weapon is a Breathable Medium Vibration Device, or BMVD for short.\n\nWhen we deployed against the humans, our troopers were well equipped with a variety of directed BMVDs and a wide array of frequencies. We weren't sure what would work best, so we mixed and matched frequencies. The humans didn't even seem phased. In fact, it was the opposite. They lowered their rifles, and one of them yelled something we later learned meant \"Hell yeah! Turn it up!\" They were *enjoying* this!\n\nOur worst casualties came on an island north of the peninsula they call \"Europe.\" We witnessed a similar lowering of rifles and a thing the humans call \"dancing\" in this theater. Then a human male wearing a garment that I have been assured is most definitely not a skirt, even though it looks like a skirt, said \"Sorry ah'm late to the party, lads. Let's do this!\" He then drew a new kind of weapon, filled it with air from his own lungs, and began their counterattack.\n\nI still don't know what that weapon is called, but if you see a human carrying a sack that matches the color of his not-a-skirt and has tubes sticking out of it, run."

                "body": "Inspired by [this writing prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/pgkzg2/since_most_aliens_bluff_before_a_fight_theyre/):\n\n# =====\n\n# We had been standing across from the enemy, yelling insults back and forth. The insults from the humans were very creative, but barely loud enough to be heard by the enemy.\n\nI bellowed across the battlefield. My clan mates joined in. Our collective roar had been known to turn the enemy before the real fighting could even start.\n\nNot so in this case.  The enemy called our traditional bluff with a roar of their own. Theirs was louder.  This enemy had us outnumbered about five to one, even with our human reinforcements.\n\n\u201cA\u2019ight, that\u2019s enough,\u201d the human warrior standing next to me said. He was the leader of the human forces that were assigned to us. His command was similar in size to my own, a unit they called a \u201ccompany.\u201d\n\n\u201cLieutenant,\u201d he said, calling for one of his troops.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d the lower ranked officer replied as she approached.\n\n\u201cRally the troops. We\u2019re going outside the wire,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d was the lieutenant\u2019s only acknowledgement. She then turned and began speaking into her communication device. After a moment, she said \u201cCaptain, they\u2019re ready, on your order.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the human captain responded. \u201cLet\u2019s show these jokers what war cries are for.\u201d With that, he readied his own weapons and began moving forward.\n\n\u201cCaptain, where are you going?\u201d I asked him, trying to keep up.\n\n\u201cOn the offense,\u201d he said with the same matter-of-fact tone he would have used if he had instead said \u201cto go get a meal.\u201d\n\n\u201cCaptain, our orders are to hold this position for as long as we can,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cWe were not ordered to go on the offense. Going on the offensive is insane.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly. They\u2019ll never expect it,\u201d the captain replied.\n\nI spoke to raise another objection, but the human captain never heard it. In fact, I couldn\u2019t hear it, either.\n\nThis was because the human warriors had become streaming out of their defensive positions and issuing a bellowing roar that drowned out every other sound.\n\nThe amount of sound truly belied what one would expect from the number of warriors advancing against our enemy. Weapon fire in the form of machinegun fire and mortars joined the chorus of voices.\n\n*This is suicide,* I thought to myself. But surely enough, the enemy hesitated to return fire. I ordered my troops to arm up and prepare to advance as quickly as they could.\n\nI bellowed out the order to advance as the enemy\u2019s hesitation started to cost them numbers. As my troops poured forth, we attempted to mimic the yell the humans let forth.\n\nIncredibly, the enemy had broken and retreated. When my forces caught up to the humans, I sought out their captain.\n\n\u201cThat was insane,\u201d I told him.\n\n\u201cIt worked, didn\u2019t it?\u201d he replied. I didn\u2019t really have a response to that. \u201cHey, when this whole thing is over, you ought to come back to Earth with me. My family would love to meet a real, live alien. We can go camping. It\u2019ll be great.\n\n# =====\n\n# \u201cCaptain, I did not know that there were hostile forces on your home world,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cCaptain, we\u2019re surrounded by at least two massive armies. They\u2019re clearly about to attack,\u201d I replied. *How could he not hear them?*\n\n\u201cWhat are you- Oh, that,\u201d the captain replied. He motioned toward his offspring. They approached him and he spoke softly into their ears. They scampered away with excited glee. \u201cHang tight, friend. I\u2019ll show you what\u2019s going on. For now, just take my word, it is no hostile army you\u2019re hearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am dubious of this claim, captain. But trusting you got me through the war, so I will wait,\u201d I replied.\n\nSoon, one of his offspring came back with its hands held in front of it, one cupped over the other. A shrill sound emanated from the child\u2019s hands, matching the war cries of one of the armies surrounding us.\n\nOnce the child grew close, it opened its hands to reveal a small amphibian to be the source of the noise. \u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d I inquired.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tree frog,\u201d the child replied gleefully.\n\nEven on its own, this \u201ctree frog\u201d was so incredibly loud. But there were so many around us, I could not even begin to guess at their numbers. How could such a small thing make so much noise?\n\nBefore I could contemplate that for very long, the other of the captain\u2019s offspring came running up to us, its hands cupped in a manner similar to the first.\n\nThe sound emanating from this child\u2019s hands was even louder than the sound made by the tree frog. I was curious to see what sort of amphibian was making this noise.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to look quickly, Mister Alien,\u201d the child said. \u201cWhen I open my hands, this thing will fly away.\u201d\n\nA flying amphibian? Incredible! What insanity will the humans\u2019 home world conjure next?\n\nSurely enough, as soon as the child opened its hands, the creature contained within flew away. This was no amphibian, however. This was clearly an insect of some sort.\n\n\u201cAre the insects at war with the amphibians on your world,\u201d I turned and asked the captain. He laughed and assured me that was not the case.\n\n\u201cSo that was not a warrior caste insect your child just captured and released so casually?\u201d I inquired dubiously. It was so large and so loud.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the captain replied.  \"That was just a cicada.\"\n\n\u201cBut their war cries,\u201d I said somewhat incredulously.\n\nThe captain laughed again. When he finally stopped, he said \u201cThose aren\u2019t war cries. Those are mating calls.\u201d"

Sure. there are quite a few inconsistencies that don't match up with the information we have on the whole city (which is not a lot), but it has always been very interesting to me to have a bird's eye view of everything, something like the intro parachute scene, but freely looking.

I know people say as a general rule if you\u2019re unsure, it\u2019s venial, but it feels like a gray area. I did something knowing it was a grave matter, but at the time I felt that there were mitigating factors that would bump it down to venial. Namely lack of full consent. And I thought that the sin was an unintended consequence of something else I was doing and that I didn\u2019t actually want to do it. Almost like it was something that just happened to me.  But looking back I could\u2019ve stopped it, so I\u2019m confused, because technically I chose to do it.\n\nI even had the thought, \u201cthis might be a mortal sin, but I guess it\u2019s probably not in this case.\u201d For it to be mortal, do you have to think, \u201cthis is a mortal sin, yet I\u2019m choosing to do it anyway\u201d?\n\nI am going to confess it as soon as I can.

How many Revenant Shells were buried under Kings Canyon?\n-It was over 194,000, as the back of the screen, shown in another post that I'll link in the comments, states that over 100,000 units recovered and 94,000 destroyed. That is alot of shells for just one planet, how many other sites like this exist?\n\n2. How many times has Revenant died?\n-well, according to the report, Revenant has died 297 times in the last year (Since the start of the previous seasons, I forget which season was the start of that previous year). This means that he has died more than what Revenant implied in Pathfinders Quest.\n\n3. How is this affecting Revenant?\n-This is essentially as the report says \"Existential Despair\", which means that the more he dies, the less he cares. He is relentlessly seeking death as we all know. In this emotional state, that's why he is sloppy and slipping up. He lost his edge. This is made clear since out of his 297 deaths in the last year, 77% were preventable. \n\n\nHope this clarifies this screen and the lore implications behind it!"

                "body": "Based on the Question by u/TheZahn, I have an idea for an ltm that has been itching in my head for a while, and I hope to present it to you:\n\nThis Ltm is summarized as the Canon Legends Event\n\nWhat do I mean by this? To put it simply, all legends are buffed or needed to where they are in the stories actual Canon. This is a normal battle royale/Arena event, no special game mode, just lore accurate legends.\n\nHere are the tweaks that are made:\n\nAsh: Can Phase Breach but can't let teammates use it.* tethers make players stay still for 1 second, the reverts  to its current state untill it is destroyed.\n\nBloodhound: Passive-Can now track any living player in real time, Artur picks up ammo and meds from killed enemies and can tame/sneak past the Prowler nests on Strom Point. Ultimate has shorter cool down, but it remains the same nether the less.\n\nBangalore: Added passive: Improved accuracy with all weapons. Can also switch fire modes faster. Her barrage is not a timed strike, it is like a real rolling barrage, a line of Gibraltar Mortars lined up creeping up to 100m. Her ultimate can now insta kill players or destroy their shields.\n\nCaustic: has infinite gas traps. Gas stays longer in indoor areas, and is shorter in outdoor. Gas damage ticks in units of 5 rather than 1 indoors. More traps increase the tick rate. Ultimate has no cool down.\n\nCrypto: Drone is on auto pilot until manual override is needed. Auto pilot is controlled via pings and can be used during fights. Crypto can also hack abilities based on electricity or has a electronic input (Bloodhound, Gibraltar, Wraith, Mirage, Lifeline will resort to traditional healing and loses doc drone for a brief amount of time, Wattson, Loba, Rampart Wall, Horizon, Fuse, Valk, Seer) and the EmP will kill Ash, Revenant and Pathfinder since they are robots. His drone can now scan players in motion when scanning a banner.\n\nFuse: infinite Knuckle Clusters and Ultimate can change from a barrage of Fire Bombs to the ring we know.\n\nGibraltar: Arm Shield can absorb a Kraber shot, so it has 200hp to compensate that idea. Bubble shield can not be phased into. Ultimate insta Kills within a 2m radius of a shell.\n\nHorizon: she is back to her launch day self.\n\nLifeline: she has the combo of all of her abilities from buffs (Multiple revives, shield) She heals players normally like a gold backpack. If she has a gold back pack, revived players are back to full health. Ultimate has a shorter cooldown (2 minutes max) and can grant 1 gold kitted weapon, high tier armor upgrades for the squad and health. Lifeline can also use heals like a gold body sheild and stacks them in larger stacks (4 to 8, 2 to 4, etc..)\n\nLoba: Can see high tier loot, bit loot she needs for her kit is brighter and more recognizable to her. Her tactical has no cooldown. Her ultimate allows her to steal ANYTHING and allows her and her squad to steal an infinite amount of items. She can steal banners to recover teammates safely, she can steal a gun, body armor, helmet, knockdown shield from a players hands/loadout, even when they are down. She can lockpick the vaults/high tier loot bunkers.\n\nMirage: has infinite decoys with no cap that have a realistic ai or are manually controller or stand still. Mirage also becomes invisible in his ultimate like his original but the camo goes out and more decoys spawn.\n\nOctane: is lore accurate\n\nPathfinder: Back to season 0/1 Grapple, Ziplines travel as fast as wraiths portal. Players can now join Pathfinder when he uses his grapple by grabbing onto the loving MRVN. Pathfinders Passive allows him to use a survey beacon to see all players in the map at the same time like cryptos Town takeover.\n\nRampart: Can charge the Rampage and Sentinel faster. Makes all weapons in her loadout a Rampart special plus the weapons stats/hopups are back to their most op. She can also use the crafting bench faster. Sheila can be used auto pilot when in turrent mode. Sheila has infinite ammo not matter the state she is in, while stationary or moving. She is not slowed down by her turrent in movement mode. She has increased ammo on all guns.\n\nRevenant: Can't die permanently. Ultimate has no cool down, as it can be used singular or the totem. Players go back to player after being shadows with full health. Shadows have the Halloween movement. Revenant has infinite and fast climbing, crouch walks at sprinting speed, can crawl on all surfaces including ceilings. Melee Kills are insta Kills and gets a unique animation with his fists or his heirloom. He is also fortified. He also has the shadow Royale shadow revive. He also respawns from the ground not from a ship.\n\nSeer: Back to launch day self.\n\nValk: missles are insta Knocks, Valk can hover and not use any fuel. \n\nWattson: can place infinite fences, is immune to other fences, can show where the final ring is. Shield recharge is up to 15hp a second. Ultimate is the same as current Wattson. She can place fences up to 20m away.\n\nWraith: can use her tactical infinitely, but she can only do it for a shorter amount of time.*\n\n*Phasing into other players insta Kills them\n\nThis event is meant to break every legend into their canon selves."

Snow could also have easily done what he did to Haymitch, since there would have been no \"star crossed lovers\" narrative for the Capitol to care about. Katniss might have been the Mockingjay, but Peeta was the one holding it together. Without Katniss' strength, the rebellion wouldn't have its symbol.

I\u2019m trying so hard to do everything but yes I forgot too so half the things I was told to do. I probably should have written it down or put a reminder in my phone but I didn\u2019t. The third thing Rejections sensitivity. Basically I get extremely emotional easily. And I cry very very easily. Any time I think I\u2019m being criticized I tell my self I\u2019m fine blunt my eyes and heart don\u2019t want to believe that\u2019s and they do there own annoying thing. How do I manage this? I have Ritalin but I only take that for college and the semester is out. I just wanna feel normal and I want to act normal and I want to be normal. Advice is wanted and appreciated, are there any tricks you guys do to help with day to day life? Also, I take Ritalin 10 mg but only for college. And the semester for this year hasn\u2019t started yet so I\u2019m not taking any right now."

Then the other day, I got a long comment on each chapter by an author I absolutely love. She broke down everything she liked, parts that stood out, even said she couldn't believe it was my first smutty fic. I literally squealed when I read them lol.\n\nMan, I'm just on cloud nine right now. A few kind words pushed me straight out of the slump I was in with my longfic I'm working on and I've managed to get three more chapters done riding that high.\n \nSorry about the ramble, haha.

Could someone tell me what the correct format is to link a php file to an html file using the \"action\" attribute?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n<?php  \nif (isset($\\_POST\\['Email'\\])) {  \n // EDIT THE FOLLOWING TWO LINES:  \n $email\\_to = \"kelvingivens658@gmail.com\";  \n $email\\_subject = \"New form submissions\";  \n function problem($error)  \n{  \n echo \"We're sorry, but there were error(s) found with the form you submitted. \";  \n echo \"These errors appear below.<br><br>\";  \n echo $error . \"<br><br>\";  \n echo \"Please go back and fix these errors.<br><br>\";  \n die();  \n}  \n // validation expected data exists  \n if (  \n!isset($\\_POST\\['Name'\\]) ||  \n!isset($\\_POST\\['Email'\\]) ||  \n!isset($\\_POST\\['Message'\\])  \n) {  \n problem('We/re sorry, but there appears to be a problem with the form you submitted.');  \n}  \n $name = $\\_POST\\['Name'\\]; // required  \n $email = $\\_POST\\['Email'\\]; // required  \n $message = $\\_POST\\['Message'\\]; // required  \n $error\\_message = \"\";  \n $email\\_exp = '/\\^\\[A-Za-z0-9.\\_%-\\]+@\\[A-Za-z0-9.-\\]+\\\\.\\[A-Za-z\\]{2,4}$/';  \n if (!preg\\_match($email\\_exp, $email)) {  \n $error\\_message .= 'The Email address you entered does not appear to be valid.<br>';  \n}  \n $string\\_exp = \"/\\^\\[A-Za-z .'-\\]+$/\";  \n if (!preg\\_match($string\\_exp, $name)) {  \n $error\\_message .= 'The Name you entered does not appear to be valid.<br>';  \n}  \n if (strlen($message) < 2) {  \n $error\\_message .= 'The Message you entered do not appear to be valid.<br>';  \n}  \n if (strlen($error\\_message) > 0) {  \n problem($error\\_message);  \n}  \n $email\\_message = \"Form details below.\\\\n\\\\n\";  \n function clean\\_string($string)  \n{  \n $bad = array(\"content-type\", \"bcc:\", \"to:\", \"cc:\", \"href\");  \n return str\\_replace($bad, \"\", $string);  \n}  \n $email\\_message .= \"Name: \" . clean\\_string($name) . \"\\\\n\";  \n $email\\_message .= \"Email: \" . clean\\_string($email) . \"\\\\n\";  \n $email\\_message .= \"Message: \" . clean\\_string($message) . \"\\\\n\";  \n // create email headers  \n $headers = 'From: ' . $email . \"\\\\r\\\\n\" .  \n 'Reply-To: ' . $email . \"\\\\r\\\\n\" .  \n 'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion();  \nu/mail($email\\_to, $email\\_subject, $email\\_message, $headers);  \n?>  \n <!-- INCLUDE YOUR SUCCESS MESSAGE BELOW -->  \nThanks for reaching out, I will be in touch soon!  \n<?php  \n}  \n?> \n\n<!DOCTYPE html>  \n<html lang=\"en\">  \n <head>  \n <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />  \n <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />  \n <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />  \n <title>Document</title>  \n <link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\" />  \n <link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\" crossorigin />  \n <link  \n href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital@1&display=swap\"  \n rel=\"stylesheet\"  \n />  \n <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"contact.css\" />  \n </head>  \n <header>  \n <p class=\"top\">  \n <a href=\"index.html\">Home</a> <a href=\"about.html\">About</a>  \n <a href=\"work.html\">Work</a>  \n <a href=\"contact.html\">Contact</a>  \n </p>  \n </header>  \n <body>  \n <h1>Contact</h1>  \n <h3>Contact Me</h3>  \n <form id=\"fcf-form-id\" class=\"fcf-form-class\" method=\"post\" action=\"http://127.0.0.1:5500/contact.html/message.php\">  \n <label for=\"Name\" class=\"fcf-label\">Your name</label>  \n <div class=\"fcf-input-group\">  \n <input type=\"text\" id=\"Name\" name=\"Name\" class=\"fcf-form-control\" required>  \n </div>  \n <div class=\"fcf-form-group\">  \n <label for=\"Email\" class=\"fcf-label\">Your email address</label>  \n <div class=\"fcf-input-group\">  \n <input type=\"email\" id=\"Email\" name=\"Email\" class=\"fcf-form-control\" required>  \n </div>  \n <div class=\"fcf-form-group\">  \n <label for=\"Message\" class=\"fcf-label\">Your message</label>  \n <div class=\"fcf-input-group\">  \n <textarea id=\"Message\" name=\"Message\" class=\"fcf-form-control\" rows=\"6\" maxlength=\"3000\" required></textarea>  \n </div>  \n </div>  \n <div class=\"fcf-form-group\">  \n <button type=\"submit\" id=\"fcf-button\" class=\"fcf-btn fcf-btn-primary fcf-btn-lg fcf-btn-block\">Send</button>  \n </div>  \n </body>  \n</html>"

Hence, it does not seem unreasonable to predict the eyes to be most active\u2014darting, toggling, and looking around\u2014when an individual is using an extraverted Perceiving function, i.e., Extraverted Intuition (Ne) or Extraverted Sensing (Se).\u201d\n\nAs an INFP yeah I do eye toggle, but I\u2019m not good at making direct eye contact. When talking to someone I look around but I\u2019m not really looking around you know? Lol and when I speak to someone I don\u2019t directly look at the persons eyes. Seulki eye toggles a lot but when she\u2019s speaking to someone she holds direct eye contact, and is not shy with eye contact. Compared to me she holds eye contact well when talking. And what I read was those are the differences between Ne and Se eye togglers. \n\n\u201cESPs are less likely to appear distracted when conversing than ENPs are (assuming the ESP isn\u2019t terribly bored or restless). This likely ties into what CT describes as the Se \u201clock in,\u201d in which the Se user locks their gaze onto the person they are speaking with.\u201d\n\nIt also said that Se users eyes look wide and alert. I think that describes Seulki",

I mean most likely she got it from 16personalities which has proven to be inaccurate to real mbti time and time again. I agree with this person, that she is an ENFJ. The Ne where? To me what you described is Fe , and even then just because she\u2019s playful and bubbly doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s Be dominant. From how Ive seen her she has more Fe.  \n\nAlso I agree that Suelki is ISFP. I\u2019m an INFP. Im certain of being one, I\u2019ve typed myself and others have typed me. And there are many differences I see from Suelki and INFPs. \nFor one the eye toggling? I\u2019m not sure what you mean by that but she has no problem at all holding eye contact. INFPs are a lot more shy in that regard. They are not ones to hold good eye contact, whereas ISFPs are good at holding eye contact. They are less self conscious, ISFP are more confident and less shy. \nI see no Ne in her but I see Se. She seems very present and concerned with the here and now. INFPs are more likely to be seen staring off into space now and then like they are in their own world. Have a tendency to daydream and are a bit clumsy. I see her using Fi big time, but I see no Ne at all. \n\nI only agree with you on Jin young. What you wrote about him makes sense.",

There was another girl on here who posted a selfie (she was white) and she was showing a lot of cleavage, the men in the comments were creepy still, but instead of saying things like \u201cyou look like you\u2019re experienced in the sack (which is exactly a comment I\u2019ve gotten), I saw more comments like \u201cWife material\u201d.. and I saw this right after I received the pornstar reference. It upset me because I didn\u2019t even have to show any body parts and I was seen as \u201cloose\u201d , but the other girl did and she is easily seen as wife material. I can\u2019t help but wonder what was wrong with my look that I gave such an impression. \n\nAlso I see this so much in Korean media. I consume a lot of Korean culture/media and even though it\u2019s more of a colorism issue, I notice this transferring over to foreigners. Korean girls with darker skin are considered less desirable, white skin is desirable even more \u201cfeminine\u201d. Dark skin is seen as \u201csexy\u201d white skin is seen as \u201cpure\u201d. And as you can probably guess dark skinned foreigners are not as desired as white European girls. Korean guys sexualize black girls and even Latina girls. But white girls are more admired for beauty. \nI was watching a Korean dating show and the girls with the darker skin were not sought after, but white skinned ones were because they appeared \u201cinnocent\u201d. \nIt\u2019s really awful and sad that ppl will degrade POC to sexy.

                "body": "Just some TWs before this, because it\u2019s VERY long: suicide, eating disorder, death, parental abuse, car accident\n\nHi. I turn 19 tomorrow. I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing right now but I need to write this somewhere and I figure it would be better for me if someone else saw and maybe responded.\n\nI am a model child. I have had straight As my entire life, achieved many amazing things in my years of life existence, and I\u2019m kind, respectful, and love to help others. In fact, that\u2019s my life\u2019s passion. My parents didn't really pressure me to do this. My mom is incredibly supportive of me and is my best friend. We'll get to my dad later. I am the source of pressure in my life. When I fail, my world crashes down and I am left feeling useless, broken, and worthless.\n\nI feel the need to put up a facade of happy and bubbly. It is always what people say they like about me most. I've been told at every place I've worked and since going to college how nice I am and that's why people like me. However, while I do feel this is a genuine expression of who I am, I do not feel that way most of the time. I want to. I want to be truly happy. But I hate myself. I am so insecure about the way I look and the things I say. I overthink everything in my life. I never let myself enjoy anything. I always find some way to make myself feel miserable.\n\nThough I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have really amazing things happen to me in my life, I\u2019ve also dealt with an extreme amount of trauma. \n\nWhen I was 8 my favorite aunt passed away in a tragic ziplining accident. It's hard to remember her now, but of the things I discuss, this is probably the one that impacted me the least. It's still very difficult though.\n\nThings really started getting bad when I was in middle school. I didn't really notice at the time, but looking back, I see the patterns that worsened as I got older. My dad was becoming an alcoholic. He was at least a borderline alcoholic all the way from the time I was in middle school until I left for college last August (I am attending college in a different state). Now, he doesn't drink as much. But the damage of his actions remains, and continues, even without alcohol in his life. My dad has been incredibly emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and my mother since about the time he started becoming an alcoholic. He is also what I have recently learned is an unpredictable parent - one minute, he will be funny and chill, the next, he'll be screaming at you. He struggles with his own mental health, but his abuse has left a great amount of damage upon me. My mom is also really religious (I was raised in the church for 17 years, stopped going at Covid time, and no longer identify as religious myself - no trauma from church though) and doesn't really believe in divorce so she won't leave him even though it's causing both her and me suffering. I want to cut him off but I don't know how because I WANT a relationship with both him and my mom and they are financing part of my education.\n\nWhen I was 13 years old (eighth grade), I was in a very serious car accident with my mother and grandmother. My grandma broke a lot of bones and I got a concussion. This created a very high amount of car anxiety for me and caused a lot of difficulty in the following years. The first 3 driving lessons I had with my mom ended in tears. Just two months after this, the theater at which I had been performing since the age of 9 (so 4 years) was shut down do to really bad activities that happened between one of the artistic directors and students. I was absolutely heartbroken. Theater and performance had become my life and creative outlet, and while I continue to perform to this day, that was one of the most difficult things I've had to overcome.\n\nWhen I was 14, halfway through my freshman year of high school, my mother was diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma. She underwent a 15-hour surgery to have one of her salivary glands removed, chemotherapy, and radiation. My mom is my best role model and my favorite person. She's incredibly strong (when my aunt died, she was always there for me even in the midst of losing her youngest sister), so seeing her in such a weak and vulnerable state was extremely difficult. However, she was good. The chemo and radiation worked. Fast forward to June 2020, middle of the pandemic, cancer has moved to her lungs. For the entire fall semester of my senior year of high school, my mom had to teach from home (she teaches at my high school) over Zoom while she had to do chemotherapy again. It worked! Again! Fast forward to December 2021. I come home from college to the news that my mom's nodules have gotten bigger and she'll now be taking a daily oral chemotherapy drug. My heart is broken for my mom and what she has to endure. About a week ago I was alone with my dad and he said that I should spend as much time with her as I can this summer, basically implying that she's going to die soon. Haven't stopped thinking about it since he said it.\n\nMy dad and I have a really rough relationship. I consider myself to be very emotionally mature, so I recognize my patterns and the reasons they exist. One of these patterns is compensating for the lack of a male figure in my life by dating...a lot. Since I was in eighth grade, I've only gone probably a collective 1 1/2 years without a boyfriend. (So 4 1/2 years of my life in relationships) I am really happy with my current boyfriend, who I met in college, and foresee a future with marriage and children. He treats me extremely well. However, this cannot be said for many of my exes. That whole concept of dating people who are similar to your parents...applies. One ex, in particular, was really emotionally abusive towards me. I wanted to break up with him for 5 months of our relationship but couldn't bring myself to do so because of my belief that I could fix the relationship. I also had a connection with someone I met through theater. He was 4 years older than me. We met when I was 11 and he was 15. So yes, that means things happened between us that were illegal when they occurred. He was not a manipulator. He was homeschooled and a complete weirdo and I keep using was not because we aren't friends anymore but because he's dead. We recognized a couple of years ago after things happening on and off that we would never work romantically so just stayed best friends. He overdosed accidentally last March. A few months before, in December, my boyfriend at the time committed suicide. This was my senior year of high school. Mom cancer treatment, boyfriend suicide, best friend overdose. But I said fuck it and kept going because I know I have things to live for.\n\nI got into a great college that I love and is the perfect place for me. I started dating my current boyfriend in January and I'm so in love with him. However, college wasn't all great for my first year and took a toll on my health. I developed an eating disorder due to my extreme food anxiety. Once I convince myself I can't eat something, I just can't anymore. I am really skinny and always have been (always get the \"are you anorexic?\" comments, which are soooo original and funny, and totally wouldn't be triggering to someone who actually had anorexia /s), but I've been losing weight recently. I am really worried about this and it has also made me hate my body a lot more. I am extremely physically insecure, even though I am logically aware that I am conventionally attractive, so this has made that even worse.\n\nJust when you think it's over, there's more! About a month ago, I got arrested with my boyfriend. I have never even gotten in trouble at school before. It's so difficult to explain but it's a petty theft charge and I have never hated myself so much in my life. I am going to walk away with a clean record after doing a course and community service, but I feel like I've ruined everything for myself. I hate who I am and that I feel that I've disappointed everyone around me who knows. It was a completely horrible in the moment act that I feel has ruined me forever. I have been thinking about suicide a lot recently. I am genuinely not worried that I will do it, but I just think about it a lot. Which is obviously bad. But I'm now working two jobs for the summer to avoid sitting in my room all day and hating myself over everything that has happened to me. I'm working 14 hours tomorrow to avoid my birthday. \n\nAlso, I realized I never really talked about this, but I don't really have many friends. I keep people at a distance and find it really hard to have friends beyond my significant other. I am best friends with my boyfriend, but I avoid hanging out or talking to others. I don't know why. I also struggle a lot with social anxiety. I'm one of those introverted people who everyone thinks is an extrovert.\n\nAll this to say I feel lost and broken. So many details are missing from this post that could provide even more context, but this is where I am. My life feels like it will never be happy or enjoyable. I am confused and I feel that I don't have a place in the world, even though I know I have a promising future. I have gone to the doctor and therapy before, but I didn't like the therapist and she made me feel dumb. I am intelligent and aware of it and I don't like people who patronize me about the things I've been through. Also, the last time I went to the doctor (in December 2021), I lied on the depression questionnaire. I don't know how to not lie. I don't want anyone to know how broken and awful I really am. My mom knows about everything and wants me to go to the doctor but I know when I get into the room I'll just get anxious and overwhelmed and lie again on the quiz or they'll just tell me to eat better and exercise. I guess the actual culmination of this post is what the fuck should I do?\n\nI am sorry that this post is so all over the place, and sorry for any mistakes. I tried to keep things at least mildly cohesive. I've never written all of this out before. Thank you for reading.\n\nTLDR: Type A teenager who has endured an extreme amount of trauma and feels trapped in a bubble. Any advice or love is appreciated."

I have dated a lot of not great guys in the past but I finally figured out my own worth and am now dating someone who treats me the way I deserve to be treated.\n\nI don\u2019t have (and have never had) very many female friends. I\u2019m not really sure why, it\u2019s honestly something I want, but it\u2019s really difficult for me to make friends with other girls. My boyfriend, on the other hand, is almost exclusively friends with girls.\n\nThis is something that\u2019s been a little challenging for me so far, as it bothers me how many girls he texts and snapchats with, but I feel like I\u2019m doing better about it. I don\u2019t worry about him cheating on me or anything, I really do believe him when he says they\u2019re just friends.\n\nSomething has been absolutely eating at me though, and it\u2019s how much he comments on other girls\u2019 Instagram posts. He\u2019ll say \u201cpretty\u201d or use \u201c\ud83d\ude0d\u201d or some variation on tons of posts. I accidentally discovered this when I clicked on one of his friends\u2019 pages from a picture he tagged her in. The first time I found it, I got pretty upset by myself. I did talk to him about it and told him it was bothering me. He said he\u2019d work on it and he totally understood why I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of it. \n\nFast forward a few months\u2026 this is bad. I\u2019ve become obsessed with checking his friends\u2019 pages (his most recent ex-girlfriend is also included in this group of people he comments on :/). I know I should just talk to him about it, but I REALLT struggle with confrontation. Also, if I bring it up, I\u2019ll have to explain how I know about it and I don\u2019t want him to know how often I\u2019ve looked. \n\nI feel awful about it because I know he wouldn\u2019t want me to be hiding how upset this has made me and the whole situation is just making me feel awful about myself. I cried about it today and I just feel like it\u2019s becoming too much to keep in my head.\n\n\nAny advice or just good vibes would be greatly appreciated \u2764\ufe0f Also I know this isn\u2019t 100% what this sub is for but I feel like this community will be able to support me and make me feel loved :)"

I can continue using `nomodeset` and attempt to continue the installation of AMD Mesa but it doesn't solve the problem even after several attemps and re-installation of the OS.\n\nI'm sure this is **not** Linux Mint specific because this also happens in other distros such as Arch, Manjaro, Pop!_ OS, Ubuntu, and Tails. I only managed to run Kali and Mint.\n\n## Problem #2: AMD Driver Problem\n\nI cannot fix Problem #1 so I reverted to Kernel version `5.4.0-107`. (The latest 5.4.x kernel) I continued installing the AMD Mesa driver but I don't think it's running properly because everytime I log in, it shows a notification that video hardware acceleration is disabled. (`nomodeset` is disabled already)\n\n-----\n\n[Here's the notification that pops up everytime I run Linux Mint](https://imgur.com/Q37CgwJ).\n\n[Here is the output of `inxi -G`](https://imgur.com/mU6G0ub).\n\n-----\n\n- **OS**: Linux Mint 20.3 x86_64\n- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 5 5600G\n- **GPU**: Integrated Graphics from the CPU\n- **Monitor Resolution**: 1024x768 (60Hz, [but Mint shows 76Hz](https://imgur.com/uMjd2ST) and I'm not on a desktop PC)"

I don\u2019t have the perfect advice either, but hyperfixation on things that are distressing us is usually doing the opposite. It just stresses us out even more if all we can think about is this thing that stresses us out.\nSo i\u2018d recommend you try to find a hobby or interest that you can hyperfixate on that isn\u2019t looks and your changing body. I know at 14 it can feel like this time will last forever, but it\u2019ll be over sooner than you think. maybe this sounds rough, but you just gotta get through it. and i believe you will. but until then just try to push these thoughts and feelings as far away as you can and focus on something that makes you happy (and try to avoid media with heavy gender ideology influence) \n\nlike idk but what helped me a lot get through a dysphoric and depressed phase was finding my passion for gothic culture. maybe try to find a subculture or interest like that with music, fashion, art, literature etc etc that you enjoy and can start building your identity around :)",

I legit had forgotten about this comment up until now.\n\n- the twice in a months argument was brought up as an answer to your question about someone murdering 2 people and then 50 people because i thought that relates better than twice in a week.\n\n- you didn\u2019t answer what this has to do with anarchism, so i\u2018m guessing you\u2019re just grasping for random things to construct an argument when really there isn\u2019t much to argue about. I was bitter about people using weird neo labels to sound special half a year ago. that\u2019s literally it.\n\n- here my opinion (from this day - not from half a year ago) on this whole matter summarized so you stop picking single sentences: it\u2019s great if people reduce their consumption of animal products. they\u2019re obviously doing a lot better than people who don\u2019t care and consume unnecessary amounts. they\u2019re not vegan however, and labels like flexitarian etc seem a bit useless. they\u2019re fine to communicate ones consumption a bit better, but they\u2019re in no way in the same group of words as \u201eveganism\u201c because veganism isn\u2019t just a diet or consumption behavior, it\u2019s an ideology and lifestyle (hence why i have the flair veganarchist cause it\u2019s the combination of two of my core ideologies).\n\nalso english is not my native language so excuse me if i struggle at explaining what i mean correctly :)",

I just dreamed that yuumi got a very strange rework giving a passive to her w that almost made it feel like a sidequest lol. \n\nmy memory of the dream is a bit fuzzy but like there was this symbol popping up over the head of your ally when you'd jump out to auto an enemy and you'd have to stay outside until you completed the small quest (not sure anymore what it was, doing a certain amount of damage maybe??) before the symbol on your ally would go away and you could jump back on them. lol.\n\ndidn't make much sense imo and i hope this will never become real - there are much better ways if they actually want to rework yuumi - but i just think it's weird and funny that i dreamed about a freaking yuumi rework. and i didn't even play yuumi lately XD\n\nanyone else ever had a fun dream about yuumi?"

But in both of those promotion games a gold 4 player with 0 LP thought it would be funny to intentionally troll me and int like crazy. The first one even went afk after 10 minutes. The second one however was toxic af and started stalking my stats (idk on what website) and suddenly made a comment on me also being mastery 7 with xayah and having a lot of points on her. \n\nI played her in ONE ranked game during preseason so far where my support was a blitz who never landed a single hook and just died everytime he got to lane so i was unable to basically do anything. Therefore my kda (3/8/16) was terrible, i got no items and therefore also did no damage (somehow we still won that game tho).\n\nThis toxic player bullied me for not having a perfect kda in that one game even tho i have so many mastery points on xayah but like.... I don't play xayah to be the best xayah player lol. I know I'm not that good at her. That's also why i usually don't play her in ranked (i play supp 90% of the time). This doesn't change the fact tho that xayah is one of my favourite league characters and i love her design and playstyle a lot, despite the fact of me not being very good at it. Because surprise!!! People can enjoy things without being the best at them. League is a GAME after all and should be player for fun. \n\nI'm sorry for this rant, but it just really bothers me how this mindset is so common in the league community that just because you play a champion a lot you must be perfect at them and you're not allowed to play league just for fun. \n\nBasically this post is just me saying i love xayah even tho I'm not that good at her and that's okay too.\n\nI love all the cool xayah content on here with all these tricks and amazing plays people do. I have a lot of respect for y'all. But us average xayah players also exist and we're just as valid as an amazing xayah otp :)"

They're being straight up assholes towards me, insulting me and shushing me when I try to speak back but I'm the one who always has to have the last word and is being rude???\n\nDon't get me wrong, i know criticism is good and important and i don't mind it when someone tells me that there might be a mistake with what I'm doing and that there's a better way of doing it, but acting like the way i do it is completely wrong and there's only one right way and I'm dumb for thinking that it works any other way is just so f-ing rude. It makes me so angry. I'm being treated like a little child again that doesn't understand how anything works and isn't allowed to have their own opinions. \n\nI don't have any official diagnosis and almost no one irl knows that I'm probably autistic so they just except me to think and act like a NT. However i still don't get it. I also don't think NT should treat each other like that. Like why do they not have any respect for each other??? There's simply not one way of living or well doing anything and just because you don't understand something or someone doesn't make it wrong or invalid. \n\nSorry for this rant but I'm so angry right now. I've already had a shitty day and still deal with depression and someone calling me dumb and other insulting things doesn't help at all. I'm just trying to get through my day and get these \"simple tasks\" done like cooking, cleaning the dishes and my room and then someone just has to make me feel even shittier about it all and like I'm a total idiot and failure. Like thanks, i know i suck and would be better off dead so i don't bother anyone. \n\nSorry..."

Or the way that instead of energy shields and the whole \"oh no our shields are at 20% we'll be in trouble soon\" you see in other scifi, here you have bullets and railgun slugs turning our protagonists' ship into shredded cheese and hoping nothing critical gets hit. Or Marco Inaros and his stealth rocks, which would have totally felt cheap in a weaker world but here it's amazing.

The video flickers, and the display's own frame counter will continuously bounce up and down from 48 to 144 and everything in between. This only happens on fullscreen, everything is fine otherwise. \n\nHere's what I tried: Switching the monitor to 60 hz or turning off freesync fixes the problem, but is obviously undesirable.\n\nIt doesn't happen on Chrome. Framerate stays at 144 and there is no flickering.\n\nTurning off hardware acceleration fixes the problem, but causes overall minor stuttering and slowness to the browser, so I'd rather not turn it off.\n\nAny ideas? I'd hate to need a second browser just for YouTube.\n\nEDIT: Vivaldi 3.3.2022.47, Windows 10 64 bit, Ryzen 3600X, 16GB 3600MHz ram. Issue persists on clean profile."

I was driving around with my mom, and we stopped at the gas station. I told her to buy me a Monster. When she came back to the car and gave it to me, I saw that she got Mango Loco. I\u2019ve never had Mango Loco. In fact, I had never had anything with mango in it because my mom is allergic. I know it sounds like an inconsistency, because why would my mom buy it for me if it had mango juice in it? It turns out she just took one off the shelf without paying attention to what flavor it was\n\nAnyways when I mentioned she got me Mango Loco, at first she was like \u201cdon\u2019t drink it if it has mango in it because you might be allergic\u201d but I convinced her that if I was allergic, it probably had so little mango juice that I would probably barely react to it, if at all. In the end, I agreed to drink it slowly and to stop drinking it if I ended up having an allergic reaction. \n\nI take a few sips and my lips start to feel tingly and a bit sore. You might think that I would stop here and let her know, but guess what I didn\u2019t do? Exactly that. I ended up finishing the whole thing. Besides the tingling and soreness, it was delicious. Definitely one of the best flavors imo\n\nThe ride back home was absolutely miserable though. After I finished, I was dizzy and nauseous, my throat was sore, and my lips were red and a little bit swollen. I didn\u2019t tell her until 10 minutes or less before we got home. She wasn\u2019t super upset with me, but she was definitely (and understandably) disappointed lmao. Once I got home, I took some Benadryl and drank a shit ton of ice water and 30 minutes later I was just fine (except my lips were still a bit red)\n\nObviously it wasn\u2019t severe or life threatening, but it definitely wasn\u2019t fun either. The moral here should be pretty obvious\n\nTL;DR: I drank Mango Loco and had an allergic reaction to it"

You just need support and to learn what you want, when you want it, and how to handle it.  You\u2019re young so you\u2019re learning that- sometimes the hard way.

Hmm, I'm really not sure if I would call the incident from 2012 sexual assault or not. I mean, yeah, it probably was, but I still don't feel like that alone has affected me that much. Like I said, more the things that happened *after*. I just feel like... I didn't suffer enough from that to call me an SA-survivor, compared to what other people went through?\n\nBut thank you for your insights and your advice! I don't really know who I could talk to about that stuff though... The person I have those nightmares about is someone from my close family and we're living together. I don't have many friends, the people I usually talk to is my family itself. I *have* once told my sis about those dreams (she's, like, my best friend) and she was like \"Oh God, that sounds terrible\", and she was very surprised that I have dreams like that. But that was the only time I've ever talked about it. I really, really can't imagine that the person I have those dreams about would do anything like that though... He's not that kind of guy, he can't even understand people who do stuff like that and I've NEVER seen any signs that he would do/could've done such things. I'm SO weirded out by those dreams, really. I also usually don't think about such stuff when I'm around him, we get along very well and everything! But then, one of those nightmares happens and I'm confused yet again.\n\nTherapy would really be awesome, haha... I've been searching for a therapist for years already but it's very hard. I hope I can get into therapy soon though, there are lots of things I'd really like to talk about.\n\nThank you for support, I wish you the best! <3",

Nothing against mainstream in general but it just doesn't sound any different than every other typical '80s-hair-band-sound' to me. xD Just a bit boring to me, there's nothing about that album that clearly screams \"Alice Cooper\", in my opinion, nothing that has his special charme. (Even though I love 'Poison' and also like 'Bed of Nails' and 'Hell is living without you' a lot!)\n\n'Raise your fist and yell' and 'Constrictor' are two of my favourites though. But I also agree with 'Dada', 'The Eyes of Alice Cooper' and 'Welcome to my nightmare' being high in the rank. 'Dada' and 'Welcome to my nightmare' are my very favourites, I love the stories behind them and the general dark and twisted vibe. I definitely need to listen more to 'From the inside', it totally has the right ingredients for me to be a very great album, and I do enjoy it but it just never grew on me like many other Alice-albums did for some reason.",

But personally, I think that's bullshit. People can ship whatever the hell they want, no one 'takes away' anything just because they have a different headcanon than another person. The queerness in canon is still there, whether people write straight fanfics about that character or not. It's not 'queerphobic' if you simply like that certain pairing that happens to be straight more than one that's lesbian. (I'm queer myself and I like Ivy/Harley but I think I'd prefer Ivy/Scarecrow, too, that's just a really interesting ship. xD)",

But this is about the sexual attraction, and apparently, people have different perceptions of what sexual attraction actually is, too. My personal definition is: Romantic attraction means I can have a crush on someone. That feeling with 'butterflies', being nervous and excited in a positive way around that person etc. Sexual attraction, to me, means that I can get turned on by a person. What set of genitalia that person has doesn't play a role for me, I like both vaginas and dicks. I can get turned on by vaginas a lot but I'm not really able to develop a real crush on a woman. I could develop a crush on a passing trans man though, his genitalia wouldn't make me see him as anything else but a man. I only have real crushes on men but a trans man IS a man, and when he passes, I can develop the same kind of feelings for him I can have for cis men. I define myself as homoromantic/bisexual. Genitals don't play a role, both are hot - but other gender/sex-specific characteristics determine if I can feel romantic attraction/have a crush or not. \n\nI don't know if this still had to do with your original topic but I hope this was helpful for you in any way, haha. What I want to say is just, I think sexuality/orientation is a complicated thing and it's okay that people perceive those things differently. You're absolutely not weird! What you described actually sounds pretty normal to me. :)",

                "body": "I have ambivalent thhoughts about this topic. At first, I thought all she did was saying her opinion that trans people are not really the gender they identify with. Not more. That alone wouldn't make me stop buying her stuff (if I was even really interested in HP-merch). I mean, I obviously don't agree with that opinion but I still think - as long as she respects trans people despite that opinion and lets them live their lifes, she's allowed to HAVE that opinion. But apparently, it's not only that. She seems to be obsessed with trans people and seems to support transphobic stuff. If the money she earns from people buying her merch is spent for organisations against trans people that will make it harder for us to get HRT and stuff, then that absolutely sucks, of course. \n\nPersonally, I think people can have their own perception of things and are allowed to voice their opinion - and shouldn't be punished for that. But only as long as they really don't harm anyone and have respect. I no longer see her as someone who doesn't harm anyone. So maybe she shouldn't earn more money from those whose lives she's trying to make worse. Even if she herself doesn't even see that she's making their lives worse and thinks that she's doing the right thing. That's always the problem with such people, they think they're in the right and are doing something good in fact. That WE are the ones who have the wrong idea of ourselves and will eventually realize that we are in fact just 'running away from our birthsex' for whatever reasons. She is blind to the fact what being trans really means. Many people are, that's the problem. But not all of them have that much influence as she has, luckily. \n\nSo, yeah, I always liked the Harry Potter-movies and I will probably continue liking them but I've never been a 'hardcore-fan' and I've never read the books. And I'm kinda glad that that's the case. :'D If I was such a big fan, the whole thing would probably be way more painful for me. When I like something very, very much, I also kinda look up to the creator, and knowing that someone I look up to is an asshole or just someone with very problematic opinions/opinions that go a lot against my own and affect me personally, is something I don't like to experience.\n\nStill watching the movies, however, is different to me. The books have been made by her alone (there are rumours though that she didn't write them herself, haha) but the movies are so much more than just J.K.Rowling's work. The movies are also Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman etc., and of course all other people of the staff. There are many people who made HP what it is, and many/most of them probably don't have the same opinion as Rowling. They just have nothing to do with all that stuff. Daniel Radcliffe even said he finds it awful what Rowling said and stands with all LGBTQ-people out there (as far as I remember). So, I think it's a difficult situation. It's not the whole fandom's fault that the one who originally brought it to life can't think out of her own box.",

I don't know if this is the right place for this post but there's something that makes me worry and I don't know where else to talk about this.\n\nI don't really feel like I belong on this sub because I don't feel like an SA-surivor - there *was* an incident in 2012 with an older guy (a friend of my best friend whom I had never seen before that day) who wanted me to do... uncomfortable things while we were playing 'Truth or Dare'. I did those things, and I was even okay with it because I just saw it as a game (I was very, very drunk though and had never done anything like that before - I was 18). What felt much worse for me was the way he behaved after that. He obviously had a crush on me and was very intrusive, and then he said very disgusting things to me on the internet and even manipulated my best friend into thinking I didn't care about them, and well, because of that, that friendship died. I think I'm over that by now but that was still a pretty traumatizing experience for me. More emotionally though, the sexual things that happened during the game weren't really *that* terrible for me. So I don't feel like a 'survivor of sexual assault'.\n\nThat being said - here's my actual problem. Since about 2014, I keep having strange nightmares now and then about... well, about a man from my reallife. I don't wanna say who it is, this is very, very uncomfortable for me. It's NOT the guy from 2012, it's someone I'm very close to and who I love very much but in a platonic way. In those dreams though, I'm forced to have sex with him, and tonight I even had a terrible nightmare in which I had found out that he has abused me as a child and still wants to do such things with me, and I was completely devastated. I absolutely don't believe that he has EVER done anything like that in reality! I have literally NO clue why I have those dreams but I've had them too often by now to ignore them, I find this concerning.\n\nDo you think there was something in my childhood I don't remember? Or could someone have nightmares like that for another reason? Could it also have to do with the incident in 2012, even though the situations in my dreams are very different from what happened back then? I must admit, I'm not a mentally stable person but I don't have any problems with sexuality usually, I'm very open about that whole topic. I'm a trans man though, if that's important in any way. And there are things that have made me wonder for a long while now if there might be something I don't remember - I've always felt a strange connection to SA-survivors and the whole topic in general, and I also react in a weird, aggressive way to some peoples' (men's) touch, as if I had to defend myself, even if it's just a fatherly, gentle gesture. I don't know why I react that way and I feel sorry for being like that but I also feel offended somehow, way too extreme. (With 'touch' I mean something like 'that person wants to help me put on my coat'.)\n\nSo, yeah... I apologize if this post is somehow inappropriate or anything, I've just found this sub and hope it was okay posting here. I'd just really like to know what real SA-survivors think about this, if that's okay...?"

I've already posted this question in the general LGBT-sub and the aromantic sub but didn't get any feedback, so I'll try it here, too. And maybe keep it a little shorter, haha. (Here's the longer post, if that helps and you wanna read it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/aromantic/comments/yyvs4v/what\\_exactly\\_is\\_romantic\\_attraction/](https://www.reddit.com/r/aromantic/comments/yyvs4v/what_exactly_is_romantic_attraction/))\n\nI'm totally not sure what exactly defines romantic attraction. I know it's different from sexual attraction. But I think I sometimes struggle to tell romantic, sensual and platonic attraction apart? My personal definition of romantic attraction is - I'm able to experience having a crush on someone. A crush for me is when I have that 'butterfly-feeling' in my stomach while thinking about someone. Being nervous when I'm talking to or just near a certain person, in a positive feeling way. Just being euphoric about a certain person but more for irrational reasons than something I can explain very well. That's a crush for me. I only experience those crushes with men, in a gay way, not really with women. Yet I do feel some sort of attraction towards women, and it's not only sexual. I can be in a serious relationship with a woman, and I can feel a deep kind of affection for women (when I like them a lot) that makes me want to be near them, cuddle, kiss etc. Just without that 'crush'-feeling, and I generally experience that sort of affection very easily when I like a person I don't find totally unattractive. It's often just connected to friendship for me, I could imagine stuff that's considered sexual and/or romantic with many, many people without automatically having a crush on them or wanting a romantic relationship with them. Having a crush, wanting physical contact (kissing etc) and wanting a relationship with someone are three entirely different things for me, and I think that's kinda unusual from what I've heard from other people...?\n\nI just thought, as asexual people, maybe you've engaged in that whole topic a lot and can tell me your opinions about it? What defines romantic attraction for you? What do you think could I call myself? I currently tend to call myself homoromantic/bisexual but it doesn't feel entirely right 'cause most people would probably interpret that as 'not interested in a hetero-romantic relationship', I guess? It's just so complicated! :'D (And now this post turned out longer than planned, too!)"

It just isn't a real crush but that's not important for me in a serious relationship, more important for me is the whole chemistry, that we get along and give each other comfort and support. I would like to experience being intimate with a guy/someone I have a crush on some day though, I've never had the chance to experience that in my life yet. (My fiancee would be okay with that and that wouldn't change anything about my love for them and my future plans with them. I'm sure about that.)\n\nSo, yeah... sorry for the long explanation! But I'm just kinda confused about all that stuff and I hoped some people here could tell me what they think about it? Would you call that 'homoromantic/bisexual', too? How would you define romantic attraction? For me, it's not the urge to do 'romantic things' with someone but the ability to have an actual crush on someone \u2013 which are two different things for me. But I have no clue if that's the actual definition, and I think there has to be one definition 'cause how would people know they're aro if there are multiple ways to define romantic attraction? I just want a bit more clarity. xD"

                "body": "In one of my main-subs here on Reddit (a sub of my main-fandom), there's a challenge where you answer a question everyday, and I want to answer every question honestly, even if I already knew that I'd probably get hated for that. And yeah, well - the second question already was \"What's your favourite ship?\". Most people replied with canon-ships or one gay ship that's only one-sidedly canon but still very popular. I followed my own rules and replied honestly that I'm more into ships that require some more imagination and that I'm also very into dark, toxic and controversial relationships in fiction because I find the problematic stuff most intriguing and interesting, even if I don't support toxic stuff in reallife, of course. And then I've listed my favourites. Got six downvotes (could be worse, yeah xD) and some replies saying \"Dude, that's incest\", \"Dude, that's problematic\". Lol. Like... yeah, I literally said I'm into the problematic ships. Is it really so hard to imagine that some people like problematic and dramatic ships more than the ones that are overall happy with each other? I mean, there are LOTS of problematic things happening in the actual show, lots of characters are psychopathic/sociopathic killers who like to torture others but those characters still have many fans because, I guess, people can distinguish the things that are happening in the show from bad stuff happening in in *reality*. Why is that suddenly a bad thing when it comes to pairings? I didn't even imply in any way that toxic stuff should be glorified or normalized in fanfiction, I made it clear that I still see how problematic those relationships are. (And I also find it funny how the incesctuous part always seems to be considered the absolute worst, lol. It's worse that they're siblings than the fact that their relationship itself is toxic as hell. Of course, two guys driving each other completely insane, being obsessive, killing people and being overall really unhealthy WOULDN'T be a problematic ship if they WEREN'T siblings. Yeah. Makes perfect sense. Btw, I've also said in my comment that all the ships I've listed aren't really non-consensual in my headcanon. Still problematic and maybe dubcon but that there's always more in my headcanon than what's shown in canon.)\n\nAnother dude under another post was totally weirded out because I *considered* that one character (who's, like, 21) *might* have romantic feelings for another character (who's 16 but really mature for his age). Because that's \"a child and an adult\". At least the guy was nice and didn't downvote me, haha. I get the feeling that people who are not into fanfiction are more prone to be anti-shippers than people in the fanfiction-community, could that be? I mean, it kinda makes sense - when you're the type who likes to make up own stories about characters and read other's own stories, you're probably more open for different interpretations. But still... how come that stuff that's even slightly controversial (to be honest, I don't find a pairing where one is 16 and the other is 21 *that* controversial) is only 'bad' when it's about shipping? How can people who are fans of a show where so much dark stuff happens suddenly be shocked because someone likes some dark ships? Like I said, I kinda expected that but it's still so weird to me. :'D If someone in that sub says \"I have a crush on this and that (very toxic and dangerous) character\", they don't get downvoted... but saying \"I ship those two characters because I find their dark dynamic interesting\" is shocking? Ooookay!\n\n(Sorry for the long rant, I'm sure many people have already shared similar experiences but I just needed to talk to a community who understands me and doesn't try to make me feel guilty or weird because of the *fictional* stuff I like, haha!)\n\n(EDIT: Okay, I just saw another person under that post where I talked about the ship with the 16-year-old saying that \"that's pedophilia and everyone who says otherwise is either a pedo or delusional and insane\". :'DD)"

First ten months were on a low dose (I use gel and took one pump per day), now I'm more than eight months on a 'normal dose', I'd say (two pumps per day). And I *still* didn't have many changes, I'm still waiting for something to happen. I have stubble on my chin and a bit more hair above my upper lip. I have a bit more body hair in general. I have bottom growth. And with the two pumps, my voice has also dropped a little but it's still nowhere near a men's voice most of the time. Sometimes it's deeper which gives me euphoria, and I have voice cracks. I mainly feel/hear a big difference when I'm singing. But while speaking, I often still sound female. Apart from that, nothing has changed. (I even still have my period, dammit!) I'm still so far away from passing, and I constantly see pictures of trans guys who are on T just for some months and pass way better than I do. The post I've written a comment to said it takes \"three months max to have visible changes you can't hide from others, even on a low dose\", and if that's true for most people, I'm really, really wondering what's going wrong with my transition and if I'm just stuck and will never pass. :/ Or do I just have to increase the dose even more? I'm a bit scared of that, I thought three pumps a day would be a lot, and I'm worried what that will do to my body? (I mean, health-wise. And I'm also so glad that I'm not losing hair anymore, I'm afraid three pumps a day would change that again, haha. But if I could finally pass, I would accept that!) I can't really talk about all that with my endocrinologist, she's not helpful and not really competent, tbh. Of course I wouldn't increase the dose by myself but just saying, she wouldn't be of any help if I asked her any questions.\n\nSo, yeah... I really love the changes I've had so far but when I started HRT, that definitely wasn't how I expected it to be after one and a half years (and almost nine months on a normal dose). Any advice?"

This was around a year ago. But then a couple months later I had a gender crisis :)\n\nI feel uncomfortable when I see my naked body in the mirror. The lower part doesn't bother me when it's in underwear, but whenever I look at my chest I just want it to be flat. As flat as possible. Flatter than a board. Slightly concave would be even better. Simply having any sort of non-flatness from my neck to my abdomen when I look down makes me avert my eyes. Looking at myself is slightly better when there's at least a bra on.\n\nLately, for the past few months, I've been wearing almost exclusively \"tomboyish\" clothes or my brother's and dad's clothes. I wear something that looks a bit too feminine and I'm hit with a wave of discomfort. Which is weird because a couple years ago I was wearing almost exclusively some feminine looking crop tops, and I loved them. Now I can't bear to wear them. I've cut off skirts from my life since 6th grade, but again, I wanted skirts again two years ago. Never wore them out, just wore it at home to admire them, but now I take it out of my closet and my mind immediately goes \"nah\".\n\nI see a lot of agender people having short hair, but I really don't want my hair shorter than chin length. I love my longer hair. But it's confusing when I see agender people having short hair to pass as androgynous because yes, I do want to look androgynous but I want my face and hair to be feminine looking. I want my body to be masculine/andro and my face to be feminine. But since I'm AFAB I know I'll just be looked at as a tomboy, and that's kinda depressing because I don't want to be considered as a \"girl\".\n\nRecently I tried using they/them pronouns for myself on social media. Didn't feel quite right. I used she/her pronouns. Still not quite right. But then I used she/they pronouns and that felt amazing. Like a huge weight lifted off. Because of this I started questioning whether I was agender, or a demigirl, or some other gender identity, but I don't have much knowledge about this and I'm dealing with college too, so I've just given up. The agender label is kinda unfamiliar to me and I'm still not sure if I'm cis or not but for now I've just given up trying to figure it out. I'm procrastinating on my gender realisation so that I can spend more time reading light novels and focusing on college :D"

It's also possible that where the virus is able to enter the brain but does not result in damage to the BBB, the virus might remain in neurons evading immune cells, leading to ongoing vascular dysfunction and consequential cell death.",

As many as 50% of those who survived had suffered from permanent illness/disability that prevented them from leading a normal life, very similar in nature to what we are now seeing with COVID.",

Being kind is paying attention and going out of your way to make another person's life easier or make them feel better than they previously did for no personal gain. Being polite is just sticking to safe verbage ( please, thank you, have a nice day) and avoiding rude actions.\n\nWhat do I mean by being nice/kind is not the bare minimum? I have encountered many romantic relationships where there was no kindness at all. Yelling screaming fighting hitting etc etc followed up by make up sex. Watched it go on for years.\n\nNow I do agree that good behavior is often not/under rewarded and bad behavior is over rewarded \n\nKindness seems to really only be valued by agreeable people. \n\nOften times girls are not attracted to kindness any more because it is not genuine. Doing kind actions while expecting something else in return is NOT kindness and a lot of men have adopted pretending to be kind til they get what they want the just leaving and this is why kindness is not being rewarded and if your a kind person looking for a partner who will appreciate you for who you are, well you gonna get hurt. It's like having to pay the consequences for the mistakes of other men.... \n\nThe only thing you can do is temper your heart and mind to not become bitter. Before doing a kind act ask yourself would you still do this if it gives you no reward or benefit, and if your okay with that. When I do something kind the most rewarding thing for me is making someone happier than before, the act itself becomes the reward then....\n\nOkay my autistic ass needs to stop and shut up lol.

It is an issue, but it isn't nearly as detrimental as you make it seem to be.\n\n>And obviously healers can make everyone's hp go up while Dehya can't so no need to go over that again\n\nMost healers don't grant active damage reduction and interruption resistance, while Dehya does, which leads to my second point:\n\n>If she tanked/mitigated 100% of teammates damage this would be a different conversation, but as it is right now she does not, and that puts her defensive utility on an entirely different (lower) level than even weak shielders.\n\nWeak shielders like Diona, Xinyan, Thoma (outside of cases where the active character isn't normal atacking) and c0 Layla only mitigate 100% of a certain amount of damage. After that point, if the shield breaks while on cooldown you have 0 defensive protection, both in terms of damage mitigation and interruption resistance. This makes Dehya infinitely more practical to use because her e doesn't just disappear if you take too much damage.\n\n>all those teams it's better to bring other characters over Dehya (be it for offensive or defensive criteria). And the Kokomi Barbara comparison you made doesn't quite work here because Kokomi is a clear upgrade over Barbara in several different areas whereas Dehya is not a clear upgrade over anyone.\n\nWell no. For instance, I tried playing mono pyro in the second half of this current abyss and the reoccurring theme was that:\n\n1. I kept on getting interrupted upon switching to a different character which lead to\n2. me taking too much damage while being stunlocked.\n\n It was a deeply frustrating experience having to reset over and over again because of odd timings and a lack of defensive utility outside of Bennet burst healing in a floor where one mistake can lead to your character getting deleted. Same thing for the first half chamber 2 of floor 12. Playing Xingqiu with Alhaitham in a quickbloom comp was infinitely more bareable than playing Yelan, even though Yelan has higher personal damage output and allows Alhiahtham to have higher quicken uptime.\n\nAgain, you keep looking at Dehya in isolation instead of in the context of her kit and her function within a proper team, which is why the \"why use Kokomi when Barbra exists\" argument is relevant here.\n\n>And I'm only focusing on defensive utility in these comments because your entire argument was based on the value of defensive utility and comfort.\n\nYes, which is absolutely the case with Dehya. Everyone seems to hyperfixate on her dps potential while completely ignoring her defensive utility when my original point was that her defensive utility could make her better in practice than people think. It's not that hard to understand.",

                "body": ">It is not comfort like shielders who prevent all damage and knockback, or healers who can bring the rest of your team back up to full HP.\n\nTrue, but it supplies a different kind of comfort. You effectively double the hp of every active character while having some interruption resistance and more personal damage to go along with it, something that neither shielders nor healers can do on their own.\n\n>She can't heal teammates, or even heal herself fully, so over multiple engagements like artifact farming or even overworld exploration your team's HP will constantly be dropping lower and lower. So you'll need to use food or a healer, in which case you might as well just use either of those because they work fine without Dehya already.\n\nThis largely depends on the team composition. For instance, a mono pyro team will more than likely run Bennet, or a Hu Tao double hydro team will have Xingqiu alongside her for additional defensive utility. In any case, this sounds like a \"why use Kokomi when Barbra exists\" type of argument that only looks at her defensive utility in isolation, instead of her kit as a whole and whether or not it functions well within a team composition.\n\n>Her defensive utility is nothing close to the comfort other characters provide and she doesn't really offer anything that just using a shielder, healer, or the NRE doesn't already do better.\n\nYes, because you aren't *just* using her for her defensive capabilities. She doesn't have to compete with Zhongli to be an attractive option for defensive utility.",

TCs (at least in NA) make a huge deal about Zhongli not being as great as the community thinks because he is a dps loss in almost every team, but that's the whole point of using Zhongli. You are trading in some damage for a shield that invalidates the need to dodge and heal, which makes your actual dps closer to sheet dps by decreasing factors that actively hamper your ability to deal damage. For non-sweaty gamers this is huge and part of the reason why Zhongli and Kokomi are regarded so highly.  \n\n\nIt could very well be the case that in theory Dehya is the worst character in the game if you focus purely on sheeted personal/team dps, but it could also be the case that people are so hyperfixated on just the dps part of Dehya's kit that the metric by which we measure how good she is does a disservice to her performance as a *defensive* sub-dps who applies pyro and minimizes factors that hamper your ability to deal damage.",

I've gotten ISTP, INTP and ENTP on MBTI tests in the past if that helps.\n\n\u2022 How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n\\\\19, Male. People describe me as quiet and reserved and that's because of social anxiety, which is weird because one on one conversations drain me way more than a group conversation with 3-4 people. I spend most of my time at home on the internet either learning or engaging in entertainment. I love the idea of going out to do stuff but I have very few friends to do stuff with.\n\n\u2022 Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\n\\\\I am almost certain that I've been suffering from generalized anxiety disorder since I was a child because I've always been paranoid and anxious about everything. I've caused myself panic attacks because I thought that I was having a heart attack/stroke when the slightest thing felt off about my body.\n\n\u2022 Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\n\\\\I grew up in a single-parent household with 2 older sisters and my mother. My sisters were very present in the first 7 years of my life, after that they traveled away to further their education. One stayed away to live in the country of study, the other returned and is currently living with us. She returned during my teen years. I assume that the stresses of single-parenthood affected my mother's ability to give me affection because she was unusually cold most times towards me when I went to her to spend time with her and stuff. I remember on a particular Christmas eve as a child I hugged my mother when she arrived at home late (because I was happy about the occasion) and I tried helping her with her bags, and she shouted at me for it. \n\nMy mother was a christian and I was pretty much forced to go to church every Sunday. I progressively felt more and more alienated as I got older because I didn't fully believe in the idea of God, until one day I rebelled against my mother and sister's demands of me to go to church and expressed my displeasure in being forced to believe in something I don't accept as truth. Thankfully they weren't strictly religious and they let me have my own beliefs.\n\n\u2022 What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\n\\\\Currently a student in college volunteering for the school (Student Ambassador Program). We basically represent the school and help in preparation of school events such as graduation, registration, 5K e.t.c. We also help various school departments, but so far I've only worked at \"front desk\" in the registry department to deal with student concerns and questions. We get paid a small stipend for it.\n\n  \nDo I like it? For the most part yes, but I hate working at front desk because I don't always know how to help students and they don't give you training to do so. I'm pretty much left to figure it all out but I'd rather know how to help people and not waste their time by being ignorant about something.\n\n\u2022 If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\n\\\\I'd feel happy, but at the same time I'd feel lonely. I don't have a room for myself because I share a bedroom with my sister, so privacy isn't a regular occurrence. Sure, I'd enjoy being alone but it gets lonely when there is nothing to do and no one around to do stuff with.\n\n\u2022 What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\n\\\\I enjoy football (Soccer for American redditors), capture the flag, races, tug of war basically any team-based activity with strategy/tactics involved. I used to play for my highschool's football (soccer) team but I only ever played two matches. It's safe to conclude that I wasn't very good at it, but if I were to start playing again I'd be remarkably better. The problem I had was confidence because I was very afraid of messing up and what other people thought of my abilities.\n\nBesides that, I enjoy camping and hiking. Hiking is probably the most enjoyable outdoor activity I have ever done because you get to really appreciate nature.\n\n\u2022 How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\n\\\\I'm curious about everything, but too lazy to learn about everything. I always want to learn about something new, but it's hard to stay concentrated and I end up learning about various random and irrelevant facts or information. I don't think I've seriously studied any course material for the semester so far which may be a problem but eh, I pass my subjects anyway.\n\nI have several incomplete projects in my head, ranging from creating a zombie survival game to creating a much more accurate MBTI personality test, to even starting an organization that focuses on the mental health of young people. Once again, I'm way too lazy to start any of those because I'm aware of the several steps I need to take first before I can even begin working on it. One thing I seriously want to dive deeper in is the concept of good vs bad and the idea of free will. I've thought on writing a journal on my ideas of good vs bad and if there is a reasonable way to objectively determine what makes a person or action good vs bad.\n\nI guess my ideas are mostly conceptual.\n\n\u2022 Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\n\\\\Yes, if it's something I am passionate about and have in depth knowledge on. Whether or not I'd be good at it truly depends on the people I would be leading. I have a way of being frank with people unintentionally (and intentionally, hehe), and I could seem like a complete a-hole or a respectably honest person depending on the perspective of others. I'd try to create an environment where everyone can be honest with me without feeling like they are disrespecting me or hurting my feelings because the truth hurts most of the time anyway. I'd give people an idea of what I expect and assign smaller leadership roles to others to keep the rest of people in line and on track to the goal. I'd be open to ideas, but not necessarily consider them if I predict that they would fail or not work.\n\n\u2022 Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\n\\\\I speedcube (meaning i can solve rubik cubes really fast). That's basically it I guess.\n\n\u2022 Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\n\\\\I appreciate some forms of art such as surrealism or abstract art, basically art free to interpretation and pushes the limits of creativity. I also appreciate realistic art, like drawings that looks too close to real life with extremely high detail. That takes lots of skill and practice to pull off.\n\n\u2022 What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\n\\\\I think that they are all important in their own way. The past is used to predict the future and tell us what to do/not to do in the present, and the present allows us to pave a way into the future. You could say that the present also determines our past, as any present experience becomes a point of reference in the past.\n\nWith that being said, I spend a lot of time in the future, using the past to make predictions and such. I'm not always aware of the present as a result.\n\n\u2022 How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\n\\\\I'm usually indifferent, and I'm willing to help as long as it's something that is reasonable to perform. I'd help them because sometimes people can't do things on their own, so may as well help them. Who knows, maybe you will need help in the future and those people can help you in return.\n\n\u2022 Do you need logical consistency in your life?\n\n\\\\Hell yeah, if something isn't logically consistent it bothers me.\n\n\u2022 How important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\n\\\\I value both, but due to my laziness I prefer efficiency. There are other people in the world who are made to be productive, it's up to people like me to show them how to be efficient about it.\n\n\u2022 Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\n\\\\It depends on the person and how much I care about them. Usually it's to prevent them from making an error in judgement or changing behavior that can affect them negatively in the future. I do it because it prevents unnecessary conflict for them and me. If you knew how something would play out, wouldn't you try your best to change it if it played out poorly?\n\n\u2022 What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\n\\\\Gaming, because games are cool and they take you to alternate virtual realities far different or very similar to our world. You can become a military person or a criminal or a space ninja if you choose. \n\n\u2022 What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\n\\\\I learn by doing something or being shown how something is done. This allows me to either remember through first hand experience or logically grasp something with ease. I learn very quickly this way. I struggle the most in environments that aren't mentally stimulating (e.g. I can love a subject but if the teacher is monotone or lacks the energy to capture my interest I lose interest in learning). \n\nI prefer classes involving memorization and logical creativity. It's part of the reason why I enjoyed learning programming because you get to apply what you know to solve a problem in your own way.\n\n\u2022 How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\n\\\\I can be good at it, but I can also get overwhelmed by strategizing because I try to consider all possibilities before moving forward, which can cause me to actually not create a strategy or create an incomplete strategy.\n\nI tend to just go with the flow and start projects, but rarely do I ever finish them unless it's a project due in 3 hours for 30% of my final grade.....\n\n\u2022 What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\n\\\\I aspire to get a move to another country and enjoy life mostly. Sure, I also want to become a psychologist who diagnoses people but quality of life matters more to me than that. \n\n\u2022 What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\n\\\\I fear spiders. If God exists, why?\n\nI also fear bothering people. I can feel really lonely or uncomfortable about something but I'd keep it to myself until it reaches a breaking point. It's because of how many bad social experiences I had in the past where I would completely disregard the experiences of others and just speak my mind without prior thought, only to find out that people hated me for it. After a while a fear of social interaction was destined to happen.\n\nCertain emotional situations make me slightly uncomfortable because I'm so used to disregarding my own feelings that it almost bothers me hearing people break down over something I dealt with just fine.\n\n\u2022 What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\n\\\\One time I got high off of drowsy cough medicine. Good times.\n\nSeriously though, it's when I'm not actually a socially awkward teen and I actually get along well with people in a type of relationship where we all make each other better and look out for each other even when there is conflict. \n\n\u2022 What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\n\\\\Looks like depression, anxiety, apathy, lack of motivation to do anything and strong feelings of loneliness. I went through that when I was 15-18. Dark times.\n\n\u2022 How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\n\\\\I daydream a lot about possible scenarios and past experiences where I made stupid mistakes. I tend to be moderately aware of my surroundings though, I wouldn't call myself clumsy, but more on the lines of being absent-minded.\n\n\u2022 Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\n\\\\Why am I even here?\n\nHow to get out in an emergency?\n\nI wonder how long I'll be here...\n\nWhat can I do to make myself a better person?\n\nHow long will humanity survive?\n\nHow did god come into existence?\n\nI should exercise tbh\n\nI feel so lonely and bored.\n\nIs my mother an ESFJ??? Hmmmm\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\n\\\\A while, and I don't even make them out of absolute certainty. I make them because if  I don't make the decision, the opportunity will pass. Once I make a decision I change my mind sometimes, but I usually commit to it.\n\n\u2022 How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\n\\\\I don't think I really process them at all. They kinda just exist in a corner of my mind, being grounded for being out of control and making me think irrationally. When I felt depressed I was way too focused on making myself happy and comfortable, but it reached to a point where I concluded \"hey, this isn't about how you feel, it's about what you should do for your own benefit\". I'm not a very emotional person, the idea of love is alien to me for example. Sure I feel happy, sad, angry, frustrated at times but I don't let those feelings dominate me. People always tell me that I look sad though, or that I have the whole world on my shoulders, but I don't think sad thoughts.\n\n\u2022 Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\n\\\\Sometimes yes, but I also like the idea of being genuine and honest with my thoughts. For example my dermatologist was trying to convince me to become a christian again and I even though I dislike christianity, I gave her the idea that I was considering it. It got me a discount on the price of the visit tho, thanks dermatologist lady. Sometimes honesty isn't the best policy, and it's better to let a situation play out instead of letting people have a negative impression of you.\n\n\u2022 Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why? \n\n\\\\I wouldn't go out of my way to break rules, however I don't view rules as absolute. I don't strictly abide by them, nor do I care about them unless they affect me directly. Authority isn't absolute either, and I don't think that someone with authority is always right just because they have a higher position than you. Things should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis."

Anyways after my way down I hurt my tailbone and now I\u2019ve been in pain. My main question is if I bruised it and just need to rest, ice and stretch or if it is fractured and I need to go to the doctor. I have mild pain/discomfort but no visible bruising. Sitting is uncomfortable but if I sit for long or in certain positions it hurts. Transitioning from standing up to sitting down is painful but lasts a few second only. Bowl movements are okay as long as I\u2019m standing up. I can kind of kneel comfortably but leaning down/curving my spine hurts like hell. Walking and standing is comfortable and business as usual. The only thing I would describe as scary and painful is the way it hurts when I wake up but usually after I roll my way out the bed and stand it okay. It\u2019s been like this for only about 2 days and already feels just a bit better so I\u2019m hopeful it\u2019s healing?\nI would also so far not describe my pain as excruciating and the injury responds well to ice and Tylenol"

It sounds a bit na\u00efve/improbable to reckon one can actually \"feel what someone else is feeling\" - granted, individual A may feel anger, and so does individual B... But that doesn't mean they feel it the same way, with the same intensity, or for the same reasons, so how in tarnation are they supposed to compare emotions, let alone make it theirs, unless it's from a purely theoretical/logical approach? Sounds like wishful thinking to me.\n\nApparently, I'm very good with cognitive empathy, at least when I'm willing to use it. Took quite a while to get there, though.\n\nAffective or compassionate, not sure I have it... Never have I truly \"felt\" someone else's feelings, and certainly not instinctually or right off the bat. As in, someone is crying and I feel like crying? Or they tell me a sad story and that affects me? Or they're angry and I get violent? Nope.\n\nThe only times I may feel the need to do something similar to \"compassion\" is when someone's state of mind is directly and negatively affecting my plans/goals. For example, I don't really give a damn if So-and-so is upset/sad or why, but if their being upset/sad means they're not doing what I want or need them to do, then I may be willing to fix things in order for So-and-so to function the way I'd want/need/expect.\n\nOr perhaps when someone messes with an individual I really (and I mean, *really*) value or does something that goes against my \"unbreakables\". This one's weird, though - it doesn't really stem from the idea to selflessly \"help others\", but is more akin to, \"Only I get to mess with my stuff\"... And I guess that's not what people have in mind when they think of *compassion*?\n\nSomatic? Definitely never felt that, but it sounds very intriguing. How would you describe the experience, what was it like?",

                "body": "As I wrote this, I realised my Pa G may not have followed the same parenting style as most of his generation... Aaaaand it turned into a novella, so apologies for that!\n\nSome very stark differences I remember from my grandpa and my classmates' parents:\n\n*Digital technology use/ownership*.\nEvery single one of my classmates in 6th grade had their own computer and/or a cellphone they could use freely, and they all received it as a gift.\n\nMy grandpa shared his computer with me, within a very strict schedule. He made a deal with me: after my 15th birthday, I'd raise half the money to get a cellphone and he'd give me the other half. (We never got to this, since he died before that happened).\n\n*Consequences*.\nMy friends and classmates were rarely ever reprimanded by their parents for any reason at all. Worst I ever saw/heard, parents said, \"Well, don't do that again\", and that was the end of it.\n\nMy grandpa would sit me down, ask me to explain myself, listen and provide feedback as to why what I did was inappropriate/wrong, then explained why he'd deliver X or Y consequences, and always went through with it. He never used the word \"punishment\", and in my mind they always made sense. The one time he didn't explain a consequence was the time I stole something - he slapped me across the face without saying a word. What truly hurt and made me repent, though, was seeing the disappointment in his eyes. Learnt my lesson, first and only time I ever had to be physically punished.\n\n*Allowance*.\nEveryone else got an allowance that would be the equivalent of 20 USD every week or so. Some of them had to do nothing to earn it, while others were \"paid\" to do house chores or get certain grades at school.\n\nWhen I asked my grandpa if I could have an allowance, he told me I was welcome to do odd jobs for the neighbours and he'd pay a certain amount for the different jobs I completed. Why not pay me for chores within our household or for getting As at school? His answer, \"Because those chores are your responsibility - you can't expect a reward for doing the bare minimum. And you're smart, so getting As isn't truly doing any 'extra work' at all\".\n\n*Supervision*.\nMost of my classmates' parents were the walking definition of helicopter or lawnmower types. 'Nough said.\n\nWith my grandpa, it's hard to explain... He was sort of a weird blend of Tiger and Free-range, if it makes any sense. He had very high expectations in many areas, but didn't deal out punishments when they weren't met and he was actually very understanding when I didn't perform as he expected. He allowed me to be extremely independent and encouraged me to figure things for myself, yet I always *knew* he was there and I could count on him whenever I needed help, and sometimes he'd approach to say, \"Why not try this instead of that?\".\n\n*Engagement*.\nMy friends usually spent time amongst themselves at someone's house playing videogames or stuff, parents almost never played with them. They provided a ton of toys, tools and gadgets, but it was very rare for parents to join our games.\n\nMy grandpa always had time to play with me, and encouraged me to be outdoors with him or friends. Some of the fondest memories I have as a child are hiking, trekking, climbing a small mountain, kayaking or going to the beach with my friends and Pa G/just him. Every Saturday we'd spent hours just walking around and talking.\n\n*Openness/taboo topics*.\nOther parents rarely talked to their children about Sex Ed or virtually anything. They'd closely monitor what their kids/preteens saw/heard and immediately slammed the blinds shut whenever they thought it was \"age inappropriate\" for them.\n\nSure, there were some things my grandpa was probably uncomfortable talking about, but he never showed it. I was a curious and precocious child, and he always answered me honestly whenever I asked something. If he wasn't able to bring himself to explain it, he'd direct me to books and read them with me, providing some insights while we were at it, or we'd watch TV documentaries about it.\n\nThe most awkward moment I can remember was when he escorted me to the store to get my first pads and bra - first and probably only time I'd ever seen him blush, but he never flinched at all and took it like a champ!\n\n*Obedience/discipline/overall expectations*.\nFriends and classmates never had any clear expectations, talked to their parents like they would a friend, disregarded rules if they had any, and had absolutely zero discipline. I was actually confused whenever they failed a test or even a subject and they went, \"Meh, whatever!\".\n\nMy grandpa was an Army Vet - you bet there was discipline involved in my upbringing! He expected to be obeyed if he gave an instruction. I knew I could be open with him and trust him, but the line on the sand was very clear: he was my dad/grandpa, not my friend. His expectations were high (*extremely* so, according to several people who knew him back then or heard about it later on) and also clearly stated from the get go...\n\nYet he never failed to explain why he asked me to do X or Y. If I struggled to meet any of those expectations, he'd sit down with me to figure out why that was happening, then he'd give me a hand if necessary.\n\nOne of the many things he taught me and has stayed with me till today was, \"Respect is earned, trust is gained, and loyalty is returned\"... He sure as hell walked his talk.",

Tried replacement therapy, joined support groups, did the whole damn stunt over and over again.\n\nEveryone tells you what a great idea this is, how it's the right decision and stuff. Everyone - or almost everyone - pats you in the back when you say, \"I'm going to quit\".\n\nNobody talks about the withdrawal symptoms. No one tells you how miserable you can feel during the first 4 days, or how the second and third weeks are literally Hell. The headaches get worse, your mouth feels like cotton, you get all angsty and irritable, you cough so harshly you feel like you're going to spit out a lung, and you can't seem to focus on anything. My insomnia also got much worse and I was hungry half the time. Even my periods got more painful.\n\nBut the world doesn't stop for you to take a break and try to control those nightmarish feelings and symptoms. You have to push through it, yet it's a nightmare.\n\nWhen I tried to open up about how I felt during that time, I got a huge load of backlash. I wasn't strong enough. I didn't have it in me. I was lacking self-discipline. I didn't really want to quit. Had to hear time and time again how X person was able to quit immediately, how What's-Her-Name just decided to cut her smoking and she did it, how So-and-so didn't get any withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIronically, most of the backlash came from ex-smokers, which made me feel even worse. Time and time again, I failed to just go from 40 to 0. The backlash got worse. I started believing that I really would never be able to give up my addiction.\n\nLast May, however, I thought about *slowly* cutting down my dosage of nicotine instead of trying to get rid of it completely. A few people who I talked to about this told me that was just an excuse and that I wouldn't be able to pull it off. Some others just shrugged and said it wasn't a good idea.\n\nI decided to do it anyways and to stop sharing my progress (or lack thereof) with my acquaintances. So much for having a \"support network\", I'd go the distance alone.\n\nEach week, I cut down 1 cigarette. I spaced out the cigarettes throughout the day, chewed gum in between them, ate some small snacks, walked around when I had the urge and I was close to reaching my daily quota.\n\nIt was hard at first, but the withdrawal symptoms were certainly much milder than when I suddenly stopped, and they improved over the first months.\n\nToday, I realised I'm at 5 cigarettes a day.\n\nYesterday, I only smoked 4 and didn't get any cravings **at all** after the last one. It's 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I finished smoking my 2nd at noon - still haven't felt like lighting another one yet.\n\nIf I keep this up, I might just spend the first week of January smoking every other day before finally being able to smoke one cigarette a week and then none.\n\nI'm so f\\*cking happy I could cry.\n\nJust wanted to share this with someone and encourage anyone out there who's still fighting the battle. Please don't give up. We've got this!"

She once told me that she had been growing it since 6th grade and taking good care of it because it made her transition easier. G's parents are aware of her situation and fully support her.\n\nMost of the staff either have no problem with this or we keep our opinions to ourselves and comply with the name change, pronouns, etc... That is, everyone except her Social Studies teacher, Mrs T.\n\nFrom Day 1, Mrs T has refused to change pronouns with G, deadnames her, has told her several times that she needs to \"act/dress like a man\", and often mentions her hair is too long. Mrs T has been teaching at the school since its inception and is close friends with the Assistant Principal... So, yup, a bit of seniority leverage comes at play...\n\nA few weeks ago, G came to me (I'm the tutor of her class) to tell me that Mrs T and AP had given her an ultimatum - either she had her hair cut by the end of the week, or she would get a suspension.\n\nSince G was visibly troubled and she's a nice teen, I got a copy of the school's regulations and gave it a read to see if I could help. I did find a few sentences that mentioned hairstyles but they only stated, quote, \"*Students' hair must be kept away from their faces at all times. Unruly or uncombed hair is not permitted. Hair is not to be worn any shorter than a Number 3 cut*.\"\n\nAs you can imagine, G was in fact following the rules, so I told her to get a copy of the regulations and plead her case directly with Assistant P. She did, and everything seemed okay...\n\nLast Friday, however, G broke down in tears in the middle of the lesson. While Assistant P had initially agreed that she was following the rules, she had told her that morning that her hair \"wasn't appropriate\" and she had to cut it by next Wednesday. AP even mentioned the possibility of changing the regulations to make sure she complied.\n\nThe class was in disbelief, and I felt mad. Went to talk with AP and argued for G's case, but I would've had better luck reasoning with a wall. Then, an idea - I texted my Principal (he was away for a regional meeting) to ask whether the staff had any regulations on hairstyles. He said of course not, there were no regulations. Great, that's all I needed to know...\n\nMonday morning, I walked through the halls showing off a very short pixie - short enough to still be considered professional, yet a far cry from my trademark long curls.\n\nMrs T went pale as a sheet when she saw me and my 9th graders were aghast when I entered the classroom, but ended up cheering. I got a tearful hug from G before we started the lesson.\n\nA few hours later, the Principal knocked on my door and asked if we could talk outside. He told me Mrs T had entered his office in quite a state and said something about me stirring up trouble and setting a bad example. What was that about, something to do with my new hairstyle?\n\nI told him I thought he was aware of what happened with G last week. Nope, he said. I explained the whole thing, finishing with a firm, \"You can fire me right now if you think I crossed a line\". He belly laughed and called me a firecracker before sending me back to my lesson. Mrs T and AP were called to his office during the day and, before we left, staff received a Whatsapp from him.\n\nIn short:\n\n* School regulations must be followed to a T, but so far there's no distinction between male and female hairstyles and there won't be.\n* Starting tomorrow, all 9th-grade teachers and classmates must use G's chosen name and she/her pronouns at all times.\n* Discrimination of any kind, against staff members or students, will have severe consequences.\n\nDid I play with fire? Maybe.\n\nWas it worth it? ***Absofreakinglutely***.\n\n\\--------  \nEDIT: Holy... Wow. Guys, thank you very much for all your kind words and support for G, for sharing perspectives, awards, for taking the time to read.\n\nAnd you honestly have no idea how much it means to me when someone goes out of their way to praise something I did. Truly, you can't imagine. I'm freaking crying. I really hope I can become a better teacher and person with this boost, so THANK YOU.\n\nLet's all keep up the good work!"

Compassionate empathy means taking it to another level, \"thoughts turn into action, when you want to *do* something to help and your motives are selfless\".\n\nHe mentioned that some people with ASPD may actually have a high form of *cognitive* empathy, while their *emotional* and/or *compassionate* empathy is often low, impaired, misaligned or lacking. Along with that, he told me some researchers have proposed that ASPD patients may have some sort of \"empathy switch\" so they can turn it on/off.\n\nHe further commented that empathy was to be understood as a spectrum as opposed to the black-and-white idea that either you have empathy or you don't.\n\nAll this makes sense to me, and it rings true.

This month, my 9th graders had to explore their \"dream career\".\n\nAmong other things, they had to visualise what \"success\" truly meant for them, sit a skills and abilities test, look at different careers and universities/colleges, and pick one programme to perform research on. At the end of the project, they have to write a magazine article in which they bring together all the information they gathered.\n\nAt the beginning, it was challenging for most of them - unsurprisingly, for example, nobody had ever considered that \"success\" could have a variety of interpretations - but eventually they got truly immersed.\n\nIt was really fulfilling to see them every Wednesday (when we work on the project) as they called me over and went, \"Miss Silver, I found this really awesome course in Canada/Spain/Austria/USA/what have you!\" or when they talked amongst themselves, \"This guy/lady I'm interviewing gave me some tips!\", \"Did you know you could earn XYZ after a few years of experience?\", \"I didn't know you could choose these subjects at uni!\", \"This school offers sport scholarships!\"...\n\nI've been giving out this project every year when I teach 9th. Obviously, I designed it as a sort of coaching/trial so that later on they don't find themselves as high school graduates with no idea as to what they want to do next - I never expect Ss to stick with the career they chose for this particular project when they go on to high school. Sometimes it happens that a student *thinks* this career is what they want to study, but as they do research they realise it's not a good fit for them, and I still consider the project a success. Either way, it's just a project, not a life plan by any means, and they still have 3 more years to explore and decide.\n\nBut this time, something happened that I had never witnessed before.\n\nAs it turns out, 4 teens (who didn't really hang out together or anything, and picked different careers) got extremely interested in several German universities that happen to be in the same city. The moment they learnt this, they started talking to each other more and more in class and after school, sharing what they found about their respective degree programs and stuff, including academic and language requirements, fees, scholarships...\n\nThen, while working on the project, they took things to another level - together, they checked accomodations for international students, how it was like to live in that city, cost of living and monthly expenses, etc.\n\nAn idea was born and last week they excitingly told me their plan - it contemplated them being roomies in Germany (they found a middle point between the Unis and commuting options), with each one of them raising X amount of money from this year till they graduate high school so as to get their Visas and cover expenses, as well as taking language courses together in order to achieve at least a B1 level in German by that same time (they actually compared several courses and schools available).\n\nThey even told their families about their newfound friendship and plans; their parents emailed me. Today, the teens were very happy to tell me they just had their first German lesson yesterday.\n\nWhile I know that a lot of things can happen in 3 years and this might end up being just a beautiful dream, I've literally never seen them so enthusiastic and committed to a goal... Deep down, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they actually end up doing it!\n\nSo yeah, this year's \"Dream Career\" project is already playing out very nicely \ud83d\udc9c"

I went to fetch Abby and brought her to the flat I share with my roommate \"Gary\" to calm her down (he was off at work at the time).\n\nWe spent the afternoon together until I realised it was really late, and told her we should get her a room in a motel nearby so she could spend the night (she didn't have any cash or cards on her) and I'd check on her in the morning. She said she wanted to sleep over with me, which wasn't exactly a crazy suggestion - she had done so once or twice when I was renting a studio, prior to my moving in with Gary last December.\n\nThing is, Gary and I have an agreement: no sleepovers *unless* we let the other one know in advance *and* the other one says Ok - I tried to reach him a couple of times, but his phone was off.\n\nI explained all of this to Abby, and she said she didn't want to be alone, the agreement isn't written down anywhere, and it's just this one time. I told her I was sorry, but since Gary had no way of giving me the green light, I couldn't let her stay. Again, I offered to pay for a room, or drive her to one of our friends'.\n\nShe got really upset, how could I choose a roommate I barely know over her, our friendship meant nothing to me, stuff like that. Things got heated until I told her she had to calm down and either accept one of my offers or come up with another.\n\nShe cussed at me and ran out. I followed her for a couple of blocks, saying at least I could drive her somewhere (it was past midnight by then and my neighborhood isn't exactly safe) but she ignored. I was too angry and tired by then, so I decided to go back home and hope for the best.\n\nNext morning and all through the week, I got messages from several friends berating me for not letting Abby stay the night - apparently, she had texted everyone about what happened at my flat and slept at a bus station.\n\nAfter I gave my version of the story, only one friend says I wasn't in the wrong, while the others say I'm a huge a-hole.\n\nSo now I'm seriously wondering, AITA?\n\n\nETA: Some people pointed out that I could've stayed at the hotel with Abby... TBH, I don't know why it didn't occur to me at the time, and they're right, it should've been an option.\n\nGary is a cop, works crazy hours and we have great communication - that night has literally been the sole exception. He got home at 5 the next morning, give or take. We talked about what happened, and he said if there's an emergency again, just texting him will suffice. He insisted that I still need to give him the OK for his sleepovers."

                "body": "Be advised, this is a loooooong rant just because I've never truly voiced my thoughts before...\n\nFor the record, I'm envisioning *culture* as \"the way of life of a given population/social group/nation, including but not limited to customs, rituals, expressions, arts, social institutions, and achievements\".\n\nSeveral months ago, I found the following definitions for *cultural appropriation*:\n\n\"The use of a culture\u2019s symbols, artifacts, genres, rituals, or technologies by members of another culture\"\n\nAnd\n\n\"Inappropriate or unacknowledged adoption of an element or elements of one culture or identity by members of another culture or identity\".\n\nWhile I can definitely appreciate the strong argument from the latter, I'm bemused as to the former - as I understand it, it implies that people are *not* meant to traverse beyond the culture in which they were born.\n\nThis posses a huge dilemma for me, and actually makes little sense from a certain perspective.\n\nTo begin with, it poses the issue of the existence of a \"prime/original culture\". Our history as species and societies has been plagued with different instances of contact (belligerent and non-belligerent), exchange, interchange, and assimilation between two or more cultures, which ultimately IMO has shaped contemporary society and globalization. From where I'm standing, it makes it close to impossible to pinpoint or even define which were the \"true and original\" cultural expressions of any given nation, with perhaps (*very*) few exceptions.\n\nJust to give a crude example, the *D\u00eda de Muertos*, internationally recognised as an intangible cultural heritage of Mexico by UNESCO (in order words, it's a huge deal!), is actually an amalgamation of pre-Columbian customs and European influences - it's taught as *the* ultimate example of syncretism, for crying out loud! And even now, there's an ongoing debate (albeit a quiet one) on just how deep its indigenous pre-Hispanic roots go... If one were to delve into the history of Latin America, or a number of other cultures for that matter, they can immediately appreciate how their contemporary culture has indeed been shaped by contact between different cultures and assimilation of foreign practices across history.\n\nDon't even get me started on the idea of \"Western culture\"... Or languages...\n\nThis begs the question, when/how/why exactly is something considered \"part of a culture\" in the first place?\n\nThen comes a more personal perspective - what happens when a given person has different cultures involved in their ancestry? Are they \"allowed\" to indulge in the expressions, art forms, customs and rituals of those cultures and claim them as part of their identity? Or are they invariably commited to the culture of their immediate family, or the culture to which the majority of their family belongs to? And what happens when you're adopted?\n\nThis hits close to home. I've been able to trace back my ancestry up to the 1800s or 6th great-grandparents (call me a nerd, because I am!), and to say it's a varied family tree is an understatement - just to illustrate, my maternal grandpa's parents were Lebanese and Mayan, while my grandmother's were Cuban and Spanish; my biological father was Mexican and so were most of his ancestors, but there was the odd foreigner here and there.\n\nIn this case, am I allowed to claim Mayan, Lebanese, Cuban, Spanish or any of the other cultures as my own? Am I supposed to identify solely as \"Latina\" or \"Mexican\" and thus implicitly forsake part of my ancestry?\n\nLast but not least... Ever since I was very young, I've always loved history (not obvious at all, huh?) and reading. Nothing was more exciting for me than delving into other cultures besides what would be considered \"my own\". Native American folklore, Ma\u014dri culture, Nordic lore, Arab art and literature, British language and history, Germanic history, Indian culture and cuisine, Inuit stories, you name it - I was enthralled by it all. Some caught my attention more than others, I felt a deeper connection to some as opposed to others, but the awe and curiosity were always there.\n\nAs I grew, I had the amazing chance to meet different people from around the world, and what I learnt in books and encyclopedias took a whole new dimension. Digital technologies allowed me to get new perspectives as well. And, eclectic as ever, admittedly I've incorporated some things from other cultures into my way of life, ranging from decorations, style and food to language, rituals, mannerisms, and philosophy.\n\nIt's not as if I go and say, \"Oh, this looks cool! Imma wear/use/do it!\", more like, \"Oh, this looks cool! Where does it come from? What's the story behind it? Why/how is it used?\" and then spend a fair amount of time researching before I think, \"Yes, there's a strong connection to this. Reckon I've a decent amount of understanding. I'll wear/use/do it!\". Most of the time, I'll end up just appreciating it and sometimes sharing my findings/thoughts if the situation arises...\n\nYet the dilemma still stands because I have incorporated other cultures into my life, and questions abound.\n\nMostly, when the issue of cultural appropriation comes up and the argument of \"you shouldn't use/wear/do things that don't belong to your culture\" is presented, I can't help but end up thinking, \"Why should anyone be confined to a certain culture just because we happened to be born into it? It's not like anyone had a choice in the matter\"...\n\nAlso, one could argue that if we're not allowed to live or think beyond a specific culture, then the idea of \"stepping into other people's shoes\" or \"understanding different perspectives across the globe\" is rendered practically moot. I can categorically state it's not the same thing to just read or hear about other cultures as opposed to truly experiencing them. And deep down, to refuse ourselves the chance to explore, learn, experience and indulge in other cultures sounds rather narrow-minded and even purist/fundamentalist...\n\nHell, if I wasn't supposed to learn/use things from other cultures, I wouldn't even be able to write *this* post in *this* language at all!"

Doesn't matter if you live in a small village or in the big cities.\n\nDecember is a truly firework-heavy month, especially around Christmas and New Year's Eve.\n\nThat means every damn year, I skip town on my own. I spend several nights sitting at the beach, as far away from the noise, smell and shockwaves as I possibly can, earphones on with music as loud as I can bear, curled up in a ball, trying to block out the barrages as best as I can.\n\nI have a couple of acquaintances that are understanding and have tried to get me to spend the holidays with them over the years and avoid the triggers, but it's no use. At one point or another, there's an odd neighbour that lights up firecrackers on the street, or there's the faint crackling sound in the distance, and I just lose my sh*t.\n\nWhen I've called the cops to see if anything can be done about it, I'm met with either heavy sighs or disbelieving faces. Very few of them have been empathetic, but since there are no real regulations for fireworks in my state, they can't do anything besides asking people to try and keep the noise to a minimum.\n\nThe times I've asked neighbours to please not use firecrackers usually end up in a mess, a yelling contest, or a full-on fight - I'm already known in my neighborhood as \"the crazy girl who's sensitive over loud noises\". It's embarrassing and belittling.\n\nI've tried taking sleeping pills these days just so I can literally black out. It usually doesn't work, and I don't want to play Russian roulette and end up overdosing.\n\nI've gone to therapy for years and the darned firecrackers are one of the few triggers I just can't seem to cope with.\n\nThe sound. The smell. The shockwaves. I just can't deal with it. I've tried and I can't. And I hate it.\n\nI hate not being able to control this. I hate feeling so weak, scared and vulnerable. I hate being alone every Christmas and every NYE. I hate not being able to enjoy the holidays. I hate crying over it like a stupid baby.\n\nI hate this so much."

The guy was very articulated and charismatic, obviously proud of his work and results, successful and invested not only in his field, but also in charity work and the like. Overall, I really liked him and was quite impressed.\n\nNear the end of the interview, the guy said he wanted to address someone. He stared right at the screen and went, \"Don't know if you'll ever watch this... But thank you, Miss Silver. Wherever you are, just know that you're my inspiration\".\n\nI was in shock when I heard my last name - the young man had seemed a bit familiar at the beginning, but I couldn't place him. I wondered if it was just a coincidence and he was referring to someone else.\n\nThen the man started talking about this Miss Silver, an ESL teacher he had when he was in 9th grade; recounted several conversations she had with him where she made him believe in himself and turn his life around (he said he \"was a major lazy jerk back then, but she wouldn't give up on me\"), talked about several things the teacher did for him and other students, how she had inspired him \"to be a better person, at least as amazing as she was\".\n\nThe more he said, the more my jaw fell... Finally, it clicked - 2012, my 2nd year of teaching. He was indeed my ex-student, and he was talking about me.\n\nBack then and even now, I genuinely never thought I made a huge impression on any of my teens. More like, I was one of many teachers in their lives and hopefully they had learnt something meaningful while being my students - then, I would reckon I did a good job.\n\nAnd yet there was this man, all successful and thriving almost a decade after leaving my classroom, saying how I inspired him and how he's still in contact with friends from back then and they all remember me as the teacher that truly cared, the teacher they respected and admired the most, one of the adults that truly changed their lives.\n\nI'm still crying as I type this, I'm so overwhelmed by the whole thing. It's almost surreal.\n\nHas to be the best Christmas gift I've ever gotten, hands down.\n\nETA: Woah, this exploded somewhat! Thank you for the good wishes, and I hope you all had a merry Christmas!"

They lead me there, opened the doors... And all 70+ of my students from 9th grade started singing \"Happy Birthday\".\n\nThey had decorated the auditorium as if it were the Shire (they know I'm a Tolkien junkie). They got me a cake from my favourite baker's, some presents and a HUGE handwritten banner that read, \"Thank you for being our teacher\".\n\nI had totally forgotten that tomorrow (Saturday) is my birthday. They didn't.\n\nOur Principal was also there and told me my Ss had been planning this surprise for a few weeks, even stayed late yesterday and came early today to make sure everything was set up. I had no clue.\n\nI'm typing this on my phone while ugly crying. For several reasons, I haven't celebrated my birthday in almost two decades and always spent it like it's just another uneventful day on the calendar. Today, I'm surrounded by warmth, smiles, hugs, letters, my favourite music playing, a pile of gifts (can't wait to open them; I'm like a bloody kid at Christmas), and a scrumptious chocolate cake.\n\nThis might be the best birthday I've ever had in my fricking life.

I feel like I'm going to be overwhelmed with all of this at the same time, but don't want to drop this news on them because they have been so proud of me for running. I feel like I would let them down but I just don't feel right doing all of this in the same year. I just don't know when or how to tell them I don't want to run because I have handed in my physical forms in so I can run, so I feel like I have already committed to it. What can I do?"

It makes the scene feel real in your head and despite the gruesomeness, it makes you angry, it makes you want to do something, scream, fight, get justice but knowing the deed is done and it's out your power chips at your soul. Jonathan Davis is a powerful singer and I'm imagining that he has meaning to every tone and every lyric in every song except for the joke ones.

It was perfect at the start, we had a lot of engaging conversations and we had fun and I was always smiling all the time and she told me that she loves me and I know that I love her.\n\nAfter about a year and a half, things started to get tiring and boring for me because I realized that I became the one who always start the conversation and when we talk I ask engaging questions like \"what did you do on that occasion?\" And \"what did you do today?\" (I know that's not engaging enough but that's the best I came up with). However, her responses were always short and usually don't go over 3 words, something like \"nothing\" or \"It was fine\".\n\nAs an introvert with social anxiety, this is so tiring to me to always be the extrovert in the relationship to the point that I prefer to not talk with her for weeks. And in that time she won't talk either. \n\nI remember that I asked her earlier about if she's shy but she said \"no\" then she said \"a little bit\". She also told me that she's very talkative with her girl friends.\n\nI really love her and I love the old her a lot more, what advice can you guys give me other than moving on? What does this change in her behaviour means? How can I be more engaging?\n\nTLDR, I'm an introvert with social anxiety who has to be the extrovert in the relationship with my Gf (who confessed her love for me) bc she only responds with short answers like \"yes\" or \"no\" and I need advice on what to do."

She may or may not have had a companion cat or some other animal. I think it's possible that in one of the books she finds a secret room or passage in the mansion and decides to explore it. I remember this was a series because I read more than one book that had this girl as a main character. The art style on the book cover and in some pages was very reminiscent of Tim Burton's art."

You drove to her twice, the 2nd time was to save her the cost of an Uber, and she couldn't even offer to pay for your drinks?? Wtf lol. This is incredibly rude, and I can't imagine how I'd live with myself if I treated others this way. I also get the impression she might have manipulated you into coming to her the 2nd time, but I can't say for sure. \n\nLook, don't waste your time on ppl like this; that goes for everyone. I understand that sometimes ppl deserve a pass; maybe they've had a bad day or are going through financial hardships or whatever, but even on a bad day, if you're a decent person, you're going to recognize someone doing something nice for you and acknowledge it with a thank you. If you don't, it's a strong suggestion toward entitlement. I hate to judge someone too early, but there are times when  tiny red flags pop up quickly enough to determine that the person's character & values don't align with yours. You did the right thing, and maybe your text even enlightened her a bit. One can hope lol. And whether this is normal behavior or not, it shouldn't be, period.",

It sounds like you're driving yourself crazy with overthinking, creating scenarios in your head that haven't even happened, coming up with ideal situations of how you WISH something will happen(in a perfect world) but rarely communicating those specific hopes & desires to your partner(like wanting flowers for Valentine's day). \n\nYour bf sounds very structured & focused, deliberate in his actions, probably the type of person who views life in a very systematic way as opposed to an emotional way. Now that's not to say he doesn't have emotions, it's just his emotions are probably not something he leans into to guide his way through life. He probably relies more on logic, schedules, lists, data, etc. If I'm correct on this then most likely he won't \"just know\" to buy you flowers bc there's no real evidence there from his pov to suggest that you want flowers. \n\nActions to him probably need to serve a logical purpose whereas actions to you are probably based more on tending to the emotional side of things, like doing something just bc it feels good or bc it will make someone else feel good. \n\nHis actions give you insight to who he is as a person & partner, and it sounds like you aren't really looking at who he is. If you want a partner who feels it's absolutely necessary to buy your partner flowers on Valentine's Day, then this is not the guy for you. If you want a partner who feels like Valentine's Day is special, this isn't the guy for you. And since Valentine's Day isn't special to him(probably bc he doesn't see a logical reason behind celebrating it), he isn't going to think it's that important to respond to your celebratory text about a day that doesn't have meaning to him. He may just see it as a distraction from work, and it sounds like he's the kind of person who wants to focus on work while at work. \n\nI'm not suggesting that you're wrong for hoping to receive flowers or wanting your cute Valentine's Day text to be responded to with some similar emotion. You clearly want and need that, and that's 100% OK. What's not ok or even healthy is wanting those things from someone who has shown little to no signs of being that kind of person, and then getting upset or anxious when he doesn't morph into the person you want him to be. Look at who he is. Look at who you are. Look at what you want & need from a relationship.",

                "body": "Hi, so I've completed all of the coursework for my master's in computer science. However, I haven't started the thesis. I have done a lot of background research, and I wrote a proposal draft, but it needs a ton of revisions. I am also working full-time. \n\nThe problem is, I was originally on the non-thesis track. This is because my end goal isn't to work in academia. I want to be either a tech artist, or a theme park designer, and do digital art + writing novels + coding my own video games as a side gig. Nonetheless, I had to switch tracks at the last minute. \n\nMy lab couldn't fund me, because it's a very popular lab (3D Computer Graphics), so I didn't do any research for the first two years. Instead, I was just working part-time as a web developer. I switched to the thesis track last minute for 2 reasons:\n\n1) My advisor basically said that doing a thesis and research was an expectation for his students. (I made the mistake of not talking to him much earlier in my academic career.)\n\n2) I got hired full-time as a tech artist, my dream career, at my goal company. I didn't expect to get hired before even finishing school, but I did. The thesis track meant that there was 2 less classes to take, so I foolishly thought that this would be the easier option! \n\nNow, I am totally overwhelmed. I need the 40-hour weeks because I am out of cash and I need the benefits -- my university's insurance is really bad. Plus, it's my dream job, and I'd like to stay here for a very long time. I consider this job more important than school, as it was my end goal, though I still want to finish my M.S. \n\nBut add 15-20 hours per week of thesis work on top of that, and I'm just burned out. I started doing background research for the thesis in Fall 2022. Thought I could finish by this spring. I was wrong. My research area is computational fluid simulation, because I love watching water and learning about how it behaves. But this requires a strong understanding of physics and differential equations. I only have a math minor -- thus, this is very challenging for me. It took me a long time to complete my background research and proposal draft. As a result, I probably will have to extend to a fourth year. \n\nAll I want to do after working 9 AM - 6 PM is write novels and make art. I want to be creative, but I just end up coding and researching from 7 PM to bedtime, and every morning before work, and each weekend. Plus 8 hours of code per day at work. I love coding, don't get me wrong, and I love my research area, but this has totally drained my soul. \n\nOn one hand, I already have my dream job, and even though I love what I study, I am exhausted and miserable...so why continue? But on the other hand, I've been working hard for 3 years, and I want this degree. Plus, I know my company was excited when hiring me, knowing that I was working on an MS and supposedly close to completion. \n\nIf I continue and finish this degree, I think I have to dial back the intensity, and give myself time to be creative. I do exercise daily and sleep a reasonable amount, but even so, I'm out of gas. If I stick it out, how can I get through this? Any tips are appreciated!"

I read the comments that my master's thesis proposal is inadequate and insufficiently fleshed out, and they requested to meet with me to revise my timeline -- no way that I'll be graduating by spring.\n\nHonestly, I'm more exhausted than I can put into words. I have a dream job which I am very grateful for, but all I have been doing outside of it is *thesis work*. 40 hours a week at work and then 15 to 20 hours a week on my thesis. I need the money, and this job means a lot to me. I'm done with coursework, so I \"just\" have to write a thesis, but WOW it is brutal.\n\nI find my research area (computer graphics programming) very interesting. I love it and am passionate about it, but it is also extremely complicated with a ton of physics. Honestly, my soul is drained. My life is consumed by school and work, and it is not sustainable. I have no time for working towards my deeper goals, which are becoming a great digital artist and publishing my novels. I have been pushing these goals aside for years in favor of academics. I haven't played my clarinet consistently in months, or taken time off to watch a show or play even 15 minutes of a video game. Or read all the novels I've bought and so desperately want to read. Or just sat in a park and listened to the birds. Outside of work, school rules my life. It's all I do. If I'm not studying, I feel incredibly guilty. This can take my mind to some very dark places. I want to leave my university too, it is so strict and I've come to disagree with a lot of its discriminatory policies against lgbtq people, but leaving now would be stupid because all I have to do to graduate is finish a damn thesis.\n\nI can't do this anymore. So, I won't. I'm not going to drop out. But if they make me extend, I'm dialing back. I'm making my art NOW, writing my novels NOW, and unwinding with some music or games regularly instead of beating myself up for wasting time. I won't let school rule my life anymore. And I'll take the summer off from school (I *live* for the summertime) and give myself some breathing room, maybe working on the thesis for 30 minutes a day and that's it. If that makes me take an extra 2 semesters to graduate, whatever, I don't care anymore. I'm done. I'm so burned out. But when I think of doing just a little bit every day, while taking care of myself, I feel relieved, like I can do it. Maybe slow and steady will be what wins this race.\n\nTime is still running out though. I want to leave Utah, I hate so many aspects of it and settling here permanently sounds like a horrible nightmare. My job is remote but school isn't so I am stuck here until I am finished with my degree. I'm from California and I want to go back; I was never supposed to be in Utah for this long. But, almost all of my good friends are here, plus I have a lot of great activities I do during the summertime when I don't have homework, and places I like to go. Yet I get terrible seasonal depression every winter, plus I'm 29 and nearly everyone I meet that's my age is already married with multiple kids, or divorced with multiple kids. I screwed up and missed the marriage window, as everyone was doing it at around age 22. I don't even know if I *want* kids or not. I feel like I'll never find anyone. I feel alone, like there is a great empty void deep within me that will never be filled.\n\nSo much pressure. Pressure, pressure, pressure, constant pressure. My parents want me to graduate ASAP, get married ASAP, have a bunch of kids ASAP, buy a house and new car ASAP. I don't know if that's what I want. I do know that I want to excel at my job, learn as much as I can without stress, and create beautiful fantasy worlds. But even so, the pressure remains. My parents keep pestering me for not being done with school yet, considering that I will be 30 this year. I feel like the world is passing me by. Everyone and everything moves so fast. And I am so far behind."

I'm mostly debugging pipeline and rendering issues. It involves a lot of code. \n\nI love my work -- it's a dream job -- but my goal to create digital paintings and webcomics is still there. I really want to focus on my art during evenings and weekends. However, I am not done with my schooling yet, with my master's thesis being the final obstacle in my path. \n\nThe master's thesis is in computer graphics programming, so it's related to art. I'm making pretty pictures, just with code. However, I must admit that being buried in code for 10 hours a day is quite exhausting, even though I love programming (and need the 40 hours for my finances). I just want to make art in my spare time, instead of spending my mornings, evenings, and weekends always buried in homework. As a result, I'm trying to finish this thesis extremely quickly. I have not been practicing art enough, because I am struggling to juggle it with school and full-time work. \n\nI need to make more art despite these constraints, so I've thought of the following courses of action:\n\n1) Focus fully on the master's thesis. Do not draw or make art, just push hard to get the thesis done ASAP, by the spring. Once the thesis is done, I can focus fully on art during my off hours. \n\n2) Make art for an hour a day, no matter how much thesis work I have, and try to push through the thesis in whatever time I have remaining. \n\n3) The hybrid approach. Make art for just 15-30 minutes a day, carving the time out somehow, while still focusing on the thesis as much as possible. \n\nAny tips? I like the idea of the hybrid approach the best. My skills have definitely stagnated and I would like to pick art back up. But, maybe I should wait until there is less on my plate? Any help is greatly appreciated!"

This dream occurred in two parts -- I woke up partway through, used the restroom, returned to bed, and re-entered the dream. \n\nThere was a futuristic colony set up on Mars. I had an internship mentor, who looked similar to my real-life dermatologist, and she had an office with a view outside. I believe the internship was in botany and plant research. \n\nOutside, it was different from the real Mars: there was an oasis. All around the colony, plants were thriving in an outdoor garden. One section had snow covering a few trees, but the rest of it was green. I could also see some small lakes. At the edge of the garden were some hot springs, but they were far too hot for anyone to swim in. Beyond that was the Mars that we know from waking life: Red rocks as far as the eye can see. I only needed an air helmet to walk around outside. I don't remember the color of the sky. \n\nI almost got lucid, and even stabilized the dream, but quickly lost awareness. \n\nThe colony itself had a souvenir shop. I had bought some merch, I think like shirts and stickers, to show my friends when I arrived back home. I lost the merch and found it again. I think this was around when I woke up for the first time, then re-entered the dream when I fell back asleep. \n\nI met a woman and talked with her, and we went outside the colony to explore together. We used ladders to climb up glass windows and look out over the garden. \n\nI couldn't believe I was actually on Mars. I was taking tons of pictures on my phone up top, figuring I'd send them to my brother, as proof that I had been there. \n\nIt was then the last day of the internship (kind of a time-skip). I was scheduled to get on the space shuttle back home. I was then informed by my mentor that we were in danger from some sort of alien threat, and I needed to get home ASAP. I remember entering the shuttle, and how roomy it was, and then I woke up just a few minutes before my alarm. \n\nAnyway, just thought I'd post this one somewhere, because it was quite fun and had a surprisingly coherent narrative structure."

I\u2019ve noticed my own convictions slipping as well and becoming susceptible as well, but not to the same degree. I\u2019ve been trying to move out of my parents\u2019 house for a while now because of differences in faith and just trying to be independent (we are both 19). Lately she\u2019s been suggesting moving in with her and how much she\u2019d love if we lived together, and as much as I share the same feelings because I do love her, but at the same time I understand that moving in with her before marriage is a very pagan practice, and simultaneously not helpful for having a relationship that glorifies God. How can I talk to her about these tendencies I\u2019ve seen and also help her to understand the danger of engaging more with this kind of lifestyle? I want to talk to somebody in our parish that could help us and guide us through an endeavor like this, but is there any way I can be helped for the time being?\n\nEdit: I am not trying to move in with her, I am just struggling to show her why we shouldn\u2019t until later in our life, when something like marriage and being financially independent is more viable to us.\n\nEdit again: I talked to her today after she got off work and she took everything very well. We will consult a pastor about seeking relationship guidance. Thank you all so much and God bless!"

                "body": "First of all, I want to say that I respect this game at worst. Because of that respect and enthusiasm I'm writing all these here. I really don't want to see it end up bad, incomplete, or problematic. There aren't any valid alternatives as far as I know. So at least please take these as ordinary feedbacks, if nothing else. I'm also sorry if any of these mentioned before. I just joined the sub.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bought the game with huge excitement, I've been following the game for a while and when i saw it was on sale, I smashed my card on the table and bought it.\n\nInstalled and set up the game. There were already problems but i kept going and tried 2 maps. Then i refunded right away before hitting more than 2 hours playtime.\n\nWell I'm a sucker for tactical shooter games, even hardcore ones. And I loved everything about SWAT4. So RoN was an insta-buy for me, at least I thought. Why I'm telling all this ?\n\nI wonder if the issues I think game has will be fixed later on, preferably soon. Let me demonstrate them:\n\n\\-Ingame game lobby. It may sound good on paper but I think it's a terrible idea to start with. To adjust your loadout, change the map, customize weapons, you need to load the police station lobby-map. It's even worse in multiplayer. You don't know what your teammates has, only lobby leader chooses which map to play and stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Alright, the police station is there. Then to change and adjust your loadout, you need to go to those tables, places, stations (whatever they are called) you do the adjusting. Going to the shooting range and shooting, going back to change something, then going back to the shooting range. Also add quite slow movement speed unto that, it's time wasting and unintuitive I believe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Literally no explanation for the weapons and weapon modifications stats wise. Which weapons and mod excels at what, nothing is shown or told. I figured out the most stuff myself with the ron fan wiki.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Movement speed. I know this isn't unheard of. But damn it's quite slow. I'm not expecting it to be like how it is in an average fps game, but still I think it could be maybe 15-20% faster. And also when player wears less or no armor at all, we could move faster so it's worth the risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-No brightness setting. Especially some maps but most maps in general are dark. And it's quite hard to see time to time. A simple setting may would fix this problem for players like me. But I think in general the maps should be illuminated more. Even at night, we should be able to see more.\n\nThere are flashlight and night vision, I know. But they aren't enough and even though it may fit the atmosphere of the game, gameplay wise this much of darkness is quite disturbing for me personally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Bot ordering menu. Couldn't spend much time to dwell on the settings for it tbh but if there isn't mouse select ordering system, there should be. It was quite easy to give orders and make transition between actions in Swat4. A similar system can be implemented and imo most people would love it. As I said if it's already in the game, just ignore this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit on this one : It was a minor issue I personally had. And as others said, it's more realistic this way without a doubt.\n\n\\-When too close to a wall, player cannot aim down sight. That was quite disturbing for me actually. Rainbow six siege has a different solution for it. You don't get to that close to a wall actually. I don't know what exactly can be done for this. Maybe a setting to disable it ? I know wanting devs to delete it won't work lmao\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are the concerns I had with the game. I know there aren't many maps but devs are working on them. They may release new guns, character skins and stuff. I know the game is in development. These were my concerns cause I don't know if they'll change or stay the way they are right now.\n\nWould they change these aspects of the game, so should I return to the game ?"

Today we were outside a lot but I kept my distance from my brother. In the car we all wore masks and had the windows down. I was close to my dad when we were watching a movie and I stupidly shared some chips with him. Really mad at myself for that. I was doing so well, but now I\u2019m terrified that I\u2019m going to be next AND we get on a plane on Saturday. I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll get sick Friday night or something. I hate my life. If you have any advice, or can tell me that the chances of me getting sick are low, please let me know."

Especially not in a foreign place. We had dinner at old spaghetti factory the first night, he got meatballs, then whataburger, and then pizzas at NYPD. I\u2019m hoping he has food poisoning so then I can almost guarantee I won\u2019t get sick. I feel fine so far. My dad was taking care of him all night & staying in the same room and so far he doesn\u2019t feel sick. If he does get sick though, then I\u2019ll KNOW it was a stomach flu and panic. We\u2019re flying back home in 3 nights. I\u2019m terrified that I\u2019m going to show symptoms on the plane/during the travel day. I don\u2019t want to be here. I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m just going to be in full anticipation for the rest of the trip, just WAITING to get sick. I\u2019m going to avoid my brother as much as humanly possible. \n\nAny advice for managing anxiety/not getting sick? I\u2019m just so scared.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m thinking of all the times I\u2019ve made contact with him. I ate some of his fries at dinner before he was symptomatic. And then he was eating popcorn, I took a piece or two, and then we played a card game & I didn\u2019t think to wash my hands after. I\u2019m scared I could\u2019ve gotten it through that. Is someone still highly contagious before they start showing symptoms?"

                "body": "I\u2019m just putting the questions from another mbti typing server \n\n-tell me a bit about yourself\nI\u2019m Haitian-American, I\u2019m attending highschool and am soon to graduate, Im a girl. I live in east New York. People that are close to me tell me that I\u2019m a very serious person and can be uptight, but other than that I\u2019m nice. People who aren\u2019t so close to me see me to be distant but that\u2019s becuase I\u2019m in school. A lot of my identity comes from me in school honestly..\n\n- What are your hobbies and why do you like to do them?\nMy hobbies: writing, drawing, reading digital comics and manga, I recently quit wrestling. I honestly have been doing these things for most of my life, with the exception of wrestling, I can\u2019t see myself not doing these things, I wouldn\u2019t know who I am without them \n\n- How do you see the world?\nI think that the world is bigger than I can comprehend right now.. There are so many things happening all at once, So many people doing things, there\u2019s a lot to explore but I never really intended to explore it anyways. I\u2019ve been thinking that I might just want to try after meeting my girlfriend who\u2019s passionate about travel, at least to parts of the Caribbean to learn more about my roots and my culture. I originally planned to just stay in my world, really\n\n- What's your goal in life?\n I don\u2019t really know it, not really. It\u2019s confusing right now but I used to be so sure.. I say things to people so that I look like I have it figured out but I\u2019m not sure about the things I say. I\u2019ve always wanted to be an artist but stopped saying that after I thought more about money. Then I said a mental health nurse but I wonder if I\u2019ll even be able to handle college after my grades had dropped after stuff happened. Then I\u2019m thinking about the military, but I don\u2019t think I could handle that.\n\n- What did some of the \"highs\" in your life look like? \n     Going to wrestling, it was something that I\u2019ve never done before, I had an awesome coach. Becuase of him, I was able to get myself out there more from my comfort zone and socialize. I was able to get fit. He also listened to my problems outside of wrestling and gave advice, he was like a dad. Now I\u2019m much happier becuase I\u2019m outside more becuase of it. More people know me more in school, I have more friends, I\u2019m pretty content. \n\n- What did some of the \"lows\" in your life look like? \n     One would be the SA I had to deal with for 5 years. It\u2019s made me distant from people, it\u2019s made me have such a doormat personality. \n\n- What's one thing you would change about yourself?\n       I\u2019d change the part of me that makes it hard to get good grades.\n\n- What's one thing you would change about the world?\n  I honestly can\u2019t think of anything really. \n\n- Tell me about how you view change\n     Change is how the world advances, it\u2019s how we advance. These days I\u2019m changing a lot and I\u2019m trying to figure stuff out so that hopefully adulting wont be so bad. Of course change is necessary.. Change for me is hard though, getting into the habit of something else when it feels like the habit that you\u2019re doing is okay enough already is tuff. Up till the day I started wrestling was I always lazy to change myself. I still mostly am but I\u2019ve changed in terms of my social life and a bit of my work ethic. \n\n- Tell me about how you view morality\nThere are things that are black and white, and grey, as they say. I genuinely don\u2019t think morality has to always be a messy thing if you have your own moral belief system and have it strong. I can see how things can happen though \n\n- Tell me about how you view society \nSociety is society, we\u2019re social creatures so we need each other to keep living, we can definitely be unfair to eachother though \n\n- Tell me about what you want to do for a career\nLike I said, I wanted to be an artist as well as a mental health nurse. Then I said I wanted to be in the military as in the Air Force. I\u2019m not sure anymore right now.\n\n- Tell me about your friendships in your life\nI\u2019ve got good people in my life, somehow I\u2019m usually able to find kind hearted people. Sometimes I think about it, it feels crazy knowing that there are people who you can be friends with and can never truly do you harm or have ill will against you. They\u2019re great listeners too and empathetic.. Right now compared to life before junior year am I so much lively now that I have them, and I\u2019m learning how to interact with people more and what\u2019s normal and standard. It\u2019s a journey and a dream, they know they can always rely on me too. \n\n\n- Tell me about past friendships and how they ended\nWe grew distant, Or I pushed them away. \n\n- Tell me about your current romantic relationship \nI\u2019m in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend right now. It\u2019s hard, but I\u2019m hoping for the best. It sucks though becuase she\u2019s going through some things and I feel kind of useless since I can\u2019t be there to help her. \n\n- Tell me about your past romantic relationships and how they ended. If there are too many, pick some of the most prominent ones. \nMy past relationship weren\u2019t so serious since it was in middle school so I don\u2019t think I need to say much there. I will say that I had to end it becuase it was with a guy and I ultimately did not feel right being with a guy\n\n- Tell me about how you adapt to change\nIt takes a long time, I went into detail with this earlier. If I didn\u2019t go to wrestling and was forced to change then I would still be the same as I was in middle school, very in myself and simply not social. Covid had forced a lot of changes as well which wasn\u2019t so great on my grades, It\u2019s my fault but online school was difficult for me. \n\n- Tell me about how you adapt to unexpected events happening around you that do not directly effect you\n   I remember when my mom\u2019s brother died, my mom was really sad and crying. I never saw my mom cry and I honestly didn\u2019t know how to support her, nor did I know how to support her when she was depressed. It was kind of like I was just there watching after her for a month or so. It felt really weird, I didn\u2019t really adapt so well. Mostly since me and my family members are kind of distant with eachother. \n\n- Tell me about how you adapt to unexpected events happening around you that pose a threat to you and what you're doing. \nI\u2019m honestly cowardly so I\u2019ll most likely stay out of the way so that it won\u2019t effect me because I don\u2019t want to deal with conflict if I don\u2019t have to \n\n- What do you fear?\nThe future, and how it doesn\u2019t feel planned out. I\u2019m scared of being homeless too, especially with where I live. I\u2019m nervous about going to new places but since I\u2019m kind of a shut in I\u2019m forcing myself out these days\n\n- Do you wear any social masks? If so, why?\nOf course. Wearing social masks are kind of necessary in my opinion because it\u2019s easier to deal with people"

Despite all that, my dad told me he isn\u2019t letting me go to any wrestling tournaments or matches. \n\n   I\u2019ve been going to practices for 5 months now, in which he doesn\u2019t like at all. Practice ends at 6:30, starts at 3:30. We set mats back up. currently there is only 4 of us girls + coach. Sometimes the coach has to teach us a little extra, or talks to us, he also lets us talk to him about our problems and vent. I try telling him this when I end up coming back at 7:00 (it takes me like 15 minutes to get back home). It always ends in arguments.. he tells me that the athletic schedule should say the exact times (it says it starts at 4:00-6:30, sometimes 3:30-5:30) or else he isn\u2019t gonna let me out. He tells me I should leave school (ends At 2:09) and come back rather than stay at school when it\u2019d just be easier to stay in school. We have the lunchroom as a waiting area for practices, keep in mind it takes me 15 minutes to and from school. Then he complains about me barely having a break between these times. I tried going to the school prIncipal about putting in the right times in the athletic schedule , with no luck. So I tell my dad that and he told me that I should be back by what the athletic schedule says (it says 5:30) when I\u2019ve been leaving at 6:30 this whole entire time.\n\n   At the start did he say he would not allow me to go to any tournaments and such, I was stupid enough to say that I wouldn\u2019t just to get him to stop arguing about it.. But Then last month the coach brought a flyer for the tournament for next Saturday. Since then I\u2019ve been trying to bring up tournaments and been telling him that I really want this and that I\u2019ve got to go but he mentions how school is a place to learn and how I can get hurt. We have been arguing about this a lot, honestly I haven\u2019t been defending myself properly and end up crying and saying how unfair he is and how I just wanna live my life and how it\u2019s his fault that I\u2019m sheltered and unsocialized. He brings up how I\u2019m too young, and gets off topic talking about careers and how he thinks how messed up everyone else in the house is. When my mom tried defending me  he even said that she doesn\u2019t know anything about education and that she can only cook and do my hair. At this point, I talked with my mom and my sister and she said I should just go. I gave my mom the permission slip, she is allowing me to go. I\u2019m going to tell him more about the tournament but I\u2019m walking out and going. WIBTA?"

                "body": "TLDR: my over protective dad isn\u2019t letting me go to any wrestling tournaments and says that he wants me to focus on school and not get hurt. I\u2019m walking out  with my mothers permission to the tournament next Saturday, I\u2019m going to tell him about it but I\u2019m going .\n\n\nHi, I just turned 17. I\u2019m a girl, I\u2019m originally a shut in and socially awkward. My grade average is like 82-85, my lowest grade being 73 and my highest being 94. I haven\u2019t failed a class this year. I don\u2019t skip school, don\u2019t drink, smoke, I don\u2019t go sneaking out the house usually. And if I do I tell my mom and the rest of my family where I\u2019m going.. \n\nanyways. I\u2019ve been going to wrestling practice for like 5 months now, and my dad doesn\u2019t like it at all.He mostly complains about the times on when it starts and ends, and when I\u2019m supposed to be back home, and him not wanting me to go to matches and tournaments. Wrestling practice ends at 6:30, it\u2019s also when we all help put the mats back up and I talk with team mates a bit. See I don\u2019t have a lot of friends and I\u2019m generally very quiet so wrestling gives me a chance to open up and socialize (with adult supervision ). Sometimes I would also talk to the coach because he offers anyone to vent to him about problems, or he would talk to us as a group about stuff we need to know on wrestling. So at times I end up coming back home at 7:00-7:12. When I get back home there\u2019s always arguments between me and him on me coming too late and me needing to come back home a certain time, (he said I should be back by 6:45) honestly I always end up crying and letting him win. He also tells me that I should come straight home after school and come back to wrestling so that I could have a break, unless I\u2019m tutoring. Then he complains about me going straight back out and barely having a break, because literally we start setting up at 3 and school ends at 2:09. It takes like 15 minutes to get to and from school. \n\nHere\u2019s the big part - Tournaments and matches. He told me at the start that he doesn\u2019t want me going to any championship s or anything. I was stupid enough to say I won\u2019t so that he would stop going on about it. Then I started saying that we have been training for it , and that I just have to and I want it, then he said he\u2019d pull me off. He hasn\u2019t. Whenever I argue about tournaments, specifically the one that\u2019s coming up, he goes on about me getting hurt and how school should be the main focus. I told him, what if I get hurt? What if die? At least I\u2019m dying doing something I enjoy and gives me life. When asked my mom to back me up, he said why should I get her involved? \u201cAll she knows how to do is make food and do your hair\u201d. He also talked about my siblings and how he isn\u2019t proud of any body, and would get off topic on it. The coach offered to talk to my dad , but my dad wants nothing to do with him and called him stupid. There\u2019s a tournament next Saturday and In the end I\u2019m deciding to just go. I\u2019ve told my mother and sister about it, my mom is letting me go. My coach knows about the situation. I asked my sister and she said that I should just walk out and that he can\u2019t do anything about it in the end.. I\u2019m going to talk to my dad again about tournaments, I\u2019m gonna mention the tournament again, I\u2019m not gonna let myself spazz out about it. I\u2019m going to go though. Thoughts? Would you let me go? I really want this, before I went to wrestling I would just lay in my bed. Rot in my room, quarantine was mostly hell because everyday looked the same. I won\u2019t lie, I don\u2019t always look forward to practices but these days I feel so much more alive. I push myself out the house, I talk more with people, we have also worked so hard to expand the team. He asked me if I wanted to give him a heart attack, obviously no. I just wanna live my life\u2026 is there anything else I can do at this point?"

However half of the males die of coronavirus and now there are 50 males left. Because on average gifted males appear at a rate of 2/100, we expect 1 of the 50 males to be gifted. However taking account of the female population, there are 150 people in total; 100 females and 50 males. Of the general population 33.33% (1 male to 2 females) of gifted people are now males.

However, anytime I try to search for a Litrpg with a competition focus, it's always fighting arenas or a Hunger Games scenario. When I try to search for racing, it's recommendations for stories with non-human MCs.\n\nSooo, anyone got recommendations for a story where the main focus is any sort of competitive sport? Could be jousting, dragon racing, tamed monster dog shows, high stakes scavenger hunting, debate. It can be deadly too. Especially the debates."

Ignore the turbolasers, figher complement, etc: the ISD's job is to show up, terrify the local government, enter the atmosphere, and drop a legion of troops, supporting vehicles, and even a prefab *base* to maintain lasting command and control over a hot zone. An ISD alone has enough storage to act as a supply tender for a relatively large task force over an extended period of time, thus providing sustained logistical support as long as the mission requires. It just also happens to be the  case that (on paper, anyway) they have enough firepower to dominate most pitched starship battles in which they might find themselves. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow look at the Venator. It also exists as a means to projecting power, but the motives behind that projection--countering enormous swarms of AI fighters--were very different. Venators weren't designed for planetary conquest, but for planetary *liberation.* In other words, their job was to facilitate a slugging match against a quantitavely superior (but, arguably, qualitatively inferior) opponent in space while Republic ground forces worked *in tandem* with local forces to drive out CIS insurgents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThus, it doesn't really matter whether the Venator could beat the ISD or ISD-II (though it is my stated opinion that a Venator would get blown out of the sky without much trouble by either). The question is: did each ship design satisfy the military needs of its respective governments? And in that sense, even if ISD's weren't supposedly great at combatting the Rebel Alliance (YMMV as to this), they *were* excellent at holding together an Empire by force and by fear. Likewise, even if the Venator would lose in a one-on-one match against a larger warship, its use of fighters as a force multiplier enabled it to establish air/space superiority in order to facilitate coalition-style ground operations against hostile invasive forces.",

Re: the whole \u201cno true Scotsman\u201d thing\u2026claiming to be a Scotsman isn\u2019t enough to actually be a Scotsman, just as claiming to be Christian isn\u2019t enough to actually be a Christian.\n\nThe \u201cno true Scotsman\u201d fallacy is more about changing goalposts/definitions when convenient. (E.g., not liking haggis doesn\u2019t disqualify someone from being a Scotsman as though \u201ctrue Scotsman like haggis\u201d, but someone having no Scottish ancestry and not being born in Scotland certainly would-it really is the case that \u201ctrue Scotsman were born in Scotland or at least had an ancestor who was\u201d-and that\u2019s not a no true Scotsman fallacy.) It\u2019s not always no true Scotsman just pointing out that someone doesn\u2019t fit the definition.\n\nAnother example: \u201cu/logicalmelody says he\u2019s a vegetarian, but he eats meat.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cA true vegetarian wouldn\u2019t eat meat.\u201d\n\u201cNo true Scotsman.\u201d (Except it isn\u2019t. I eat meat so I am *not* a vegetarian whether I claim to be or not.)\n\nSimilarly, if one does not follow Christ\u2019s values, it is reasonable to say they are not Christian regardless of what they claim to be without committing a no true Scotsman fallacy.",

Or is this impossible?\n\nI.e., would it be true or false that \"for every polyhedron, at least two of its faces have the same number of sides?\"\n\nFirst thought was that I guess it would probably be possible to make such a polyhedron, but having found no pictures of such a thing, and trying to think through it,  I'm less sure now.\n\nIf such a polyhedron were to exist I know we'd need polygons with a large number of sides (since smallest number of sides for a polyhedron I think is 4 with the tetrahedron, which is all triangles -3, 3, 3, 3 for numbers of sides. So for all different - 3, 4, 5, 6 would need at least a hexagon, and definitely more than this since I can't make a tetrahedron with a hexagonal side. But as I add larger-sided faces, I think I end up needing more sides to the polyhedron as well, which would drive up the n for the largest n-gon I need, in turn requiring more sides, ...etc. So now I'm wondering whether maybe this *is* impossible, although I don't have any real proof for that claim.  \n\n\nTrying to actually draw this is hard, given the high number of sides that would be needed if this is possible. \n\nAnd if it *is* possible, how many faces would one need to construct such a polyhedron?"

No one knows if they\u2019re true or just made up for attention, but various versions of them get passed down through the fandom as silly or heartwarming stories about an idol that may or may not have happened.\n\nI don\u2019t even know how much other fandoms experience this, but I was inspired by the various stories about Stray Kids that have popped up over the years, with varying levels of unhinged-ness. My favorites include:\n\n- All of the girls from another private school were in love with Felix and would purposefully ride public transport instead of driving with their parents so that they could see him. They\u2019d call him Prince Felix. Someone named their pet rat after him.\n\n- Felix had a friend in high school who was gay and would always stand up for him when he was made fun of and would give him dating advice.\n\n- A girl was in love with Bang Chan when they were in middle school because he would let all the younger kids play soccer with him and was really sweet. The day she decided she was going to confess to him, he left the country.\n\n- A girl who worked at KBS was running down the hall and tripped into Bang Chan\u2019s arms. He smiled down at her, helped her stand up straight, and left. She said she still thinks about it years later.\n\n- Someone\u2019s mom that knew Hyunjin when he was a little kid told him he had a small head and he cried.\n\n- Someone who worked at the same hotel they stayed at claimed to have overheard Felix yell \u201cwhere the fuck is my fucking key card?!\u201d and then Lee Know, who does not speak English, got the gist of what he was saying and quietly handed it to him.\n\nSo I\u2019m curious, what the stories that have spread around your fandom over the years?"

I read the guide, but to really get a feel for some of these areas within industry, I want to experience it. I've been looking to find a summer internship to fill this need (as well as something to add to my CV). My apologies if this is a stupid question, but how am I supposed to get an internship in the summer if I need to go on an IPPE? Many companies say that they are looking for someone who can do 12-14 weeks and I just can't. I found one that looked perfect, especially since it had a remote option, but in the description it said that the intern can't be doing anything else while on the internship. I know IPhO has a list of available internships in the summer, but I am not yet a member. Do you think it is worth it to pay?\n\nI know I'm late in the game to be thinking about this, but I'll take any advice I can get. Thank you!\n\nEdit: just thought I'd mention that I have zero experience in anything, so I'm not really competitive."

                "body": "We all know AI content generators have been here for a while but no-one gave a damn until these things actually got good. \n\nWe had GANs and diffusion models since 2015 but artists never reacted against it until now because AI content is genuinely getting very good.\n\nWe just read that article that AI generated content is probably gonna be 90% of the internet in a span of 3 years.\n\n3 freaking years that is not a lot of time. \n\nIf we don't do something about this we'll be living in an internet that feels like you're dreaming - where you won't be able to tell whether this is real or not. We'll have content that is indistinguishable from human content.\n\nI mean AI text is already pretty hard to identify, if you prompt language models like ChatGPT to use a particular writing style or specify to talk in the flow of a human, the output text generated doesn't even get flagged as AI generated.\n\nThis is very concerning.\n\nWhen it comes to AI art, people say they can tell by the hands of the picture. How long is that technique going to work? First AI couldn't get faces right and in a matter of months it already cleared that obstacle. \n\nAnd hands?? Half of the artists I've seen can't draw hands properly and we all know that it's coming, AI art will perfect itself in a matter of months.\n\nI don't want an internet like my YouTube Shorts recommended where I'm constantly interrupted by TTS reddit posts with a Minecraft Parkour map clip being reused again and again or some stupid Andrew tate or family guy excerpt being clipped and subtitled by an AI.\n\nI'm sure you don't either.\n\nLook don't get me wrong but AI content is fantastic, but we need transparency. \n\nWe want to be able to differentiate between these two different types of content.\n\nThis rate of progress by AI is very concerning because even artists feel threatened and they have a valid reason.\n\nBut, AI art is a different type of art.\n\nJust because an AI can \"express\" itself in a good manner does not mean than human expression is not worth anything.\n\nJust because some other entity can create art doesn't mean that humans should relinquish their ability to do so.\n\nWe have a lot of AI implications to deal with but the applications are coming faster than we can deal with these questions.\n\nIt's now or never guys, we know how Moore's Law works.\n\nHere's one solution I propose. We certify human artists and link these certificates to a database that can be viewed by the public to authenticate that the artwork is indeed human generated. This verification process will be tedious but it will be by the community so we'll figure it out. We'll scrutinize the entire work of artists to look for the consistency, context and any minor remnant artefacts including tangible proof of creation.\n\nSounds like a rather basic system but if you look at the Internet's security, the public key cryptography system, the foundation is a very simple certificate system.\n\nAny system is better than no system.\n\nI'm working on this project, it's called Exprima which is a portmanteau of \"Exprima\"(Latin for express) and primate(because we're primates)\n\nIf you want to help out I request you to reach out at r/ethicalgo\n\nI wanted to bring this up to r/AIEthics but you need to be a trusted member of the subreddit to post.\n\nr/singularity is very aware of the future but we need to go beyond a theoretical level and actually start executing AI ethics.\n\nWe can't leave these things in the hands of corporations.\n\nThe community is gonna get affected in the end and only we can change that from happening."

We have many questions to answer but let's start by containing the problem - by separating AI art and human art. \n\nI suggest that we try to certify human content creators instead of taking a more resource intensive approach. The internet, especially the foundation of its security, public key cryptography is built on trust and not sophisticated mechanisms.\n\nI'm working on a project called Exprima which is a public database containing certificates that confirm that the art created by an artist is indeed human generated.\n\nAny system is better than no system.\n\nI sincerely invite you to join me in this endeavour.\n\nPlease reach out to me at r/ethicalgo\n\nLet's actually do something about AI ethics as a community.\n\nI tried posting this to r/AIEthics but they don't let anybody post just like that plus that sub is decaying."

Sometimes it's more viable to use a simple method instead of trying to develop a convoluted mechanism to differentiate between these two different kinds of art.\n\nThis way human expression is respected as an ability in its own right. Just because some other entity has the ability to express itself does not necessarily mean that we should relinquish ours.\n\nSeparating AI and Human-generated content is the first step towards respecting human intelligence and allowing Artificial intelligence to thrive.\n\nEXPRIMA certificates are linked to a publicly available database which can be used to determine the source of the content and have been stenographically encoded with a token to verify its authenticity.\n\nI would like to hear your thoughts on this.\n\nAlso If you are an artist and would like to get certified please reach out to me with your artwork and some other details and upon verification, I can add your certificate to this database."

It could collapse our own stars before it was in shooting range, and for some of our weakest, before they even detected it. The Entity moved in seemingly random patterns, blipping in and out of existence through no technique any of our Coalition could guess. It was so absurdly massive that by all means it should have collapsed into a singularity, but instead it ate them as its main form of nutrition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt ate black holes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur best mathematicians and futurologists determined our chances of utter annihilation to be 99.9969%. The pteromorphs killed themselves in a year-long orgy. The arthrocardios tried to flee, and disappeared. We still don't know what happened to them. The lovely, sleek holostenos developed a hundred new religions and became asteroid hermits, immediately abandoning their system. We chose not to choose, and so we became nomads. The apes said \"nice\", and started the most absurd war.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first, they shot everything they could at the Entity. A planet was hurled to it, and promptly eaten; massive laser discharges were seemingly shrugged off. Infragravity wells set up with multiple stars over the course of months managed to stabilize and trap them between dimensions for around 1000 hours. Countless lives threw themselves at the Entity in every way they could conceive of, each in their own desperate way, from the basest pilot deciding to slow the Entity by a nanosecond with their tiny ship to the most brilliant scientist spending decades on a new theory that proved fruitless. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter some time, we grew bored of watching and continued to skip around systems, buying time and attempting to predict the Entity's movement so that we could live one more year, one more month. Soon enough, the apes were relegated to being an example of insanity, for they kept shooting the same silver rays at it again and again, instead of trying to escape or choosing short term pleasure or just about anything else, and our communications dismissed their every attempt to communicate.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, the inevitable happened; the Entity blinked into existence almost next to their planet, and simply absorbed the whole system, barely leaving the scraps it did not deem worth spending energy to attract. Their home colony, the main Dyson Sphere, the heart of their still young civilization, was ripped away from them, and we knew they were done for. The apes cried for its loss with their new weapons, repurposed as fireworks, not even bothering to aim at the Entity anymore; in fact, they didn't even seem to be aiming towards anything in particular. We, the travelers, didn't even have a bubble to sigh for them as we escaped, looking for the few spots in the Galaxy that could still sustain life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRumors still hung around, of course, and some apes still existed, but they were nothing more than passengers in other people's Spheres, derelicts and destitutes with no goal in life beyond living their miserable individual lifetimes experiencing whatever they could find. We had plenty of those, with the same lifeless gait, the same scientific inactivity. Their cultures were dead, and so they were dead in life; that is why we considered the apes extinct after the last mourning spark shone in one of their cold, starless planetoids. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few centuries later, the Entity warped next to a star... and didn't do anything. It had stopped its eternal harvest. It took us only a year to realize, but we had grown so cautious that we simply communicated our observations with the members of the Coalition and kept fleeing. The replies came back, and they shocked us into a crisis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Entity had no vital signs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDid it simply... die of natural causes? Wasn't that basically an impossible coincidence? The six remaining civilizations and the myriads of refugees could not figure it out. All the probes simply reported that it was inert and some people in the asteroids were shooting at it out of boredom, since no one could go beyond the Thing's absurdly dense outer layer. And as we feverishly tried to scratch the surface, literally even, the refugees realized that some of their own, mainly apes, were leaving us. \"To meet up with some old friends, I'll tell you later\", they all replied. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, it was them. Who else? We were told what they did and we still can't replicate it. These morons knew that wormholes, intermatrix theory and synthetic dequantification were not the Entity's transportation method, and they knew that nobody could find it either, but they still decided to try to discover it. Not to escape, no. They simply planned to do the same thing the Entity did and somehow displace critical pieces of its control structures to incapacitate it. Incredibly enough, they managed to do it, and attempted to notify us of the method. As it turns out, garbled as it was, the information did make its way to some of our greatest scientific organizations, where it was judged to be pseudoscience born out of mad minds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, the obvious objection must be made; if nobody could predict the movement of such a gigantic mass, how would they find said critical spots? And this objection is completely correct, for they did not. The best they could do was predict the maximum range, not even the direction of the displacement. And here lies the true reason why we now consider it a fact that the apes are mad. They simply blinked as many people as possible, as often as possible, knowing that even successful warps would simply drop the pilots inside a being they did not comprehend, or inside solid matter they likely wouldn't be able to destroy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you realize how many billions of pointless deaths they incurred in, just to have the chance to arrive to one of the weak points and then investigate if anything at all could be done to affect the Entity's movement. So many blinked into a star, too far to come back alive or be sent rescue teams for, or in the middle of rock where they permanently fused with it. So much horror that, when narrated to us in detail, it sounded like they were simply committing mass suicide; indeed, the immense majority of their population willingly Blinked, knowing the risks and dying within minutes. And while they did this, their stars, their structures, resources, everything was eaten. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut after the... Human civilization died, one of those insane beings found a spot and discovered how to manipulate it, for it was so massive that they could never destroy it with a mere Blink ship. Their spawn spent a lifetime trying to get as close as possible to the Entity's shell in order to transmit the message, which upon being received gave the people on the outside enough hints to discover how to at least point their ships in the Entity's general direction. Armed with a compass and an instruction set, it took them only another century to paralyze the Thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy all means, they lost. They should have lost. They all knew there was no guarantee the plan would work, and they all acknowledge that it was sheer coincidence that these lonely freaks managed to get in and out. And yet, not only are they coming back, but now we know they will soon surpass us, even though it's statistically impossible. Nobody says it out of fear that the morale boost will increase their chances, but I think they already know."

                "body": "I had once heard, in a forum-ehm, a tradehouse now lost to time, a rumor about a powerful cuirass in the island of vvardenfell, so powerful that it did not belong to anyone and there were no hints about its existence. \n\nThe rumor stated that there were indeed hints. One hint is, of course, its presence in the book \"Tamrielic lore\", by Yahtum Bagarn, but as far as the reader knows it might be a legend. The other hint, however, was as vague as possible, to the point that, had you not heard the rumor and taken it to heart, you could walk by the place a hundred times and never check. \n\nSomewhere close to Ebonheart, there is a beach with an odd appearance, like an old road. This road goes underwater and reaches a few rocks just off the coast. One of these rocks reveals the entrance to a grotto, where the armor lies. So the rumor goes. As precise and clear as the location of the golden kwama eggs!\n\nIt has got to be a joke, I thought, but having reached the peak of physical ability I decided to give it a try. Walking along the beach for a while was frustrating, until the road appeared; then my confidence shot up. I dove straight into the water, trying my hardest to follow the track, barely distinguishable in the murky waters. As soon as I reached a rock I'd look around, expecting an underwater door... But the road only went over the rocks and continued. As I grew frustrated, I decided to walk around the last rock and head back. It was then that I saw the door.\n\nA special potion of water breathing I prepared for the occasion went down my throat, and I jumped in. The grotto did exist! Before the fish ate me alive, I hurried through the chambers and found a dwemer ruin, abandoned for millennia, waiting. The heavy doors still spread open despite the rust, and the water was darker than ever. I expected this, so I drank the night eye potion and hoped for the best.\n\nMy underwater exploration eventually took me to a tower, where some fellow's corpse lay, his final words laying near him... How cliche. As it turned out, this Peke Utchoo fellow had followed the same rumors and reached the dwemer ruin, where he found a key, which I pocketed. His misfortune could be my luck. I prayed to the Nine for him, and laughed reading his scrawls, while shedding a tear.\n\nEventually I found another chamber, where a still functioning centurion took me by surprise. The healing potion Peke couldn't drink reminded me to drink my own before barely defeating the machine. Having lost the night eye effect, but used to the darkness, I could make out a huge dresser behind the automaton, almost calling for the key, which fit perfectly. With my heart pumping, I twisted it.\n\nIt was true. The dragonbone cuirass was there, forgotten, as clean as if it was new. \n\nIt's just sitting on my crafting table. I have no idea what to do with it. But something tells me I'm not supposed to sell it...\n\nI'll start taking heavy armor lessons."

They have some partnerships but it could just be marketing BS. There's no discourse around them from the smart people / thought leaders in my industry.

Why?\n1) There's no solid motive. \na) NY: Phil is dead, Tony & Carmine Jr are boys (AJ working for him), the other guys are too cucked to go rogue and whack a boss.\nb) Family: Paulie wouldn't do such a thing, and I don't see a reason for Patsy to do so especially as things have been tame for him recently, and the fact that he might be in-laws with T soon. I don't buy the theory about Eugene & Members Only.\n2) The final cuts: he looks towards the door as Meadow walks in and then the screen goes dark. We know for sure it's her walking in as there is nobody else in front of her in the scene where she gets out of her car. Meadow was in a rush, but if she saw someone behind Tony than she would have behaved different when approaching the door. Tony doesn't look worried either, implying no shooter directly in front of him. \n\nSure, this scene might be implying the metaphorial death of T - with the pending trial, losing a bunch of key men, killing an NY boss, his own uncle forgetting who he is, his acceptance of his sociopathy - he probably isn't happy-go-lucky after but dealing with a lot of shit."

Teimani Jews are very intermixed with the local South Arabian population. Significantly more so than most other Mizrahi Jews.\n\n2. Non-Sephardic Mizrahi Jews living in countries that came to speak Arabic were known as musta'arabim. And there were a few communities of musta'arabim in the Gallilee. Many heavily intermixed with incoming Sephardic populations, but not all did. Today, virtually all have been absorbed by the more dominant Sepharadi traditions, but a substantial number of Israeli Sepharadim have Musta'arabi ancestry. The few who managed to keep separate from Sepharadim had generally assimilated into the Syrian Musta'arabi communities. However, the Syrian Musta'arabi community has now basically fully merged with the Syrian Sephardic community, as of the mid 1900s. \n\n3. If you would like to expand your definition of \"primordial Jews\" to include those who stayed in the Assyrian captivity and didn't go back to Israel with Ezra, the Aramaic-speaking Jews of Eastern Iraq / Northwestern Iran (often called Kurdish, though this is only correct in the geographical sense) might fit the bill. Also called Nash Didan, or variants on that.\n\nAlso this is silly and intermarriage does not inherently make anyone less Jewish.",

Keeping animals in cages is a form of Sloth.  Humans are the greatest endurance runners on earth and can chase any prey down given enough time.  Challenge the animal to a fair match as God intended. (more so targeted at religious)\n\n2.) Bean and Rice Burritos at taco bell cost $1\n\n3.) The winner of the 2020 MOAB 240 mile foot race was a vegan.  David Goggins was second place.  Since he's considered the toughest man in the world, vegans are tough. #StayHard\n\n4.) Pigs get boiled alive on industrial farms, share a video of pigs living amongst dogs as if they were no different.\n\n5.) Mating with a 14 year old used to be normal until it was completely unnecessary, just like torturing animals is becoming unnecessary today.  (This is especially effective if they cite God as their moral authority to torture animals.  Remind them that God made 14 year olds fertile for a reason and check if the argument still holds up.)\n\nHorrible arguments that should be avoided:\n\n1.) The animal died (no one cares)\n\n2.) Telling them they don't have empathy (if you have to do personal attacks, call them a sissy because they are too weak to reject societies lies)\n\n3.) Environment (Target audience doesn't comprehend this. Keep in mind vegans are 10% smarter than the average person when forming arguments.  Make it simple)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary:\n\nFocus on stopping the torture of animals instead of the death.\n\nFocus on the strength it takes to have compassion. (Jesus was a chad)"

About an hour in we weren't feeling anything and we decided to take a walk to the park to smoke we decided we wanted to try joint racing (first to finish getting free food from the other person). So I finish this joint and get high from it and then we pull up to the shwarma place we were going to and the edible hits and I started feeling like I was gonna throw up. \n\nSo I stepped outside and realized I was stressing myself out so I took some deep breaths and was fine. I asked my cousin if he was feeling the edible and he said no so we walk over to the nicest benches imaginable and he tells me the edible just hit and we need to go home... \n\nSo after like 20 minutes, we make it back to his house, and we both crash in his bed and blast Beethoven and juice wrld (weird combo I know) . Here is what I got from the experience. \n\nThis type of high was crazy everything was heightened it was like there was suspenseful music when we weren't in his room and music is probably the best at this level of high.

It's not that I need my floors extra clean, I just don't want some random completely unclean corner to remain! Something similar happens when I brush my teeth, which is why I used to hate and avoid it, but nowadays I at least get it done twice a day ('cause the dentist bills piling up was motivation enough I guess). \n\nPeople really don't get why I'm so \"careful\" with some tasks and say that I could relax and do a sloppier job, but the thing is - it takes more brainpower from me to do anything sloppier, 'cause I have to actively think where to cut corners etc! So it's easier to be \"rigorous\".\n\nI just wonder if anyone here experiences something similar, and whether it really could be part of ADHD, or is it some kind of compulsive symptom after all.

I suck at WILD and usually either don't fall asleep or completely lose focus before doing so (I've only had luck with WILD a few random times).\n\nI try to do at least sporadic daytime awareness, but for some reason I really struggle with it, it feels like a full on chore, so I'm not sure if it's the method for me.

I've seen many beginners equate lucid dreaming with WILD, as if trying to lucid dream = doing WILD and there's nothing else to it.\n\nRecently I've also seen lots of people talk about weird strong and unsettling sensations when trying WILD. In my case, I've only gotten sensations I typically get when I fall asleep, which is nothing much or extraordinary. Is it actually common that people get some extreme sensations, and if they do, is that even a good sign (towards a successful WILD), or maybe a result of trying to lie unnaturally still or something?

I\u2019m doing Jonas Schmedtman course on Udemy. I\u2019ve done the fundamentals."

                "body": "# --WHAT IS IT?--\n\nThe [Gyrestone](https://gfycat.com/warmdeficientafricanbushviper) is a block that automatically picks up dropped items in a [19x19x7](https://ibb.co/khK056M) range (9 blocks horizontally and 3 blocks vertically with the Gyrestone at the center). It can be switched on or off with redstone and contains 15 [storage slots](https://ibb.co/5chbBGP).\n\n# --HOW DOES IT WORK?--\n\n\\- Gyrestones work by teleporting items into their storage using ender pearls as a fuel source. A single pearl can be used to pickup 16 items. \n\n\\- In order for the Gyrestone to pickup items, it must have ***direct*** line of sight towards them. It cannot pickup through blocks or pathfind to them around walls.\n\n\\- When an item is within range of two or more Gyrestones, it will choose one based on the following conditions in order of priority-\n\n1. Has enough space\n2. Contains dropped item\n3. Is closest to the item\n\nIf the none of the conditions are met , then the item won't be picked up. If you drop an iron ingot, it will prioritize the Gyrestone with enough space. If they all have space, it will go to the one with iron ingots. If they all have space and iron ingots, it will go to the closest one. If all of them have space, iron, and are equally close, the iron ingot won't go anywhere.\n\n# --OBTAINING--\n\nI like the idea that the Ancient Builders had access to far more advanced technology than what we currently have, so it would make sense for Gyrestones to generate as part of Ancient City loot or physically inside the building itself. It should have around a 10% chance of spawning in a chest and a 5% chance of spawning physically. I believe this is balanced as it encourages exploration and makes Gyrestones non-renewable.\n\n# --EXTRA INFO--\n\n\\- Can be used with hoppers\n\n\\- Requires an iron pickaxe to mine (Silk Touch not required)\n\n\\- Can burn/be destroyed by a cactus\n\n\\- Gives off a light level of 7\n\n\\- Stackable to 64\n\n\\- Similar breaking time to Ancient Debris\n\n# --POSSIBLE TWEAKS--\n\n\\- The majority of players do not have large amounts of ender pearls, so using glowstone blocks, regular fuel items, or even removing the fuel requirement might be better\n\n\\- Reducing the amount of storage slots to 9\n\n\\- Crafting recipe involving a lodestone, netherite, and crying obsidian\n\n\\- Can see items through transparent blocks and pick them up\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**A quick demonstration of how it could work**](https://gfycat.com/soreobedientjaeger)"

I have family and friends who have worked in dealerships, while that gives me insight into some of the issues of dealerships I assumed Carvana would just be the same bull at a higher non negotiable price. I am a contractor for a living and negotiate multimillion dollar deals, you would think I would do off better haggling with a dealer.\n\nCarvana by far beat any local trade appraisal on my wife\u2019s car which is a notoriously reliable model but a lemon year with some mechanical issues. It is base as could be and has dings and stains. However, it\u2019s extremely low mileage for the year. Knowing their trade value made us intrigued.\n\nAfter arguing with a dealer about a cpo car with 20 to 40k miles that is 3 to 4 years old and ultimately walking away because they would not replace the Chinese tires under a we owe I was left considering Carvana more seriously.\n\nDespite having a large delivery fee over 500 dollars myself and my wife found the exact exterior interior color combo with exact trim and option package we wanted at a reasonable price. The high trade in offer and specific car not being available in the local market made it worth while.\n\nWhile the experience clearly felt very \u201clow overhead\u201d I appreciated the savings. They beat any negotiations I had with local dealers. And I walked a way with a car with a better car fax, better tires, and lower miles for the same money.\n\nCustomer service was so so unless on a phone call but everything worked out and silver rock has quickly offered to resolve an undisclosed cosmetic issue.\n\nMy only complaint is the astronomical quoted interest rate which I easily avoided by several percentage points with third party financing.\n\nI would happily buy from them again if they valued other trades as well. Which for my car they have not, but it\u2019s high mileage."

So we see all of these names and characters like Baal, Lucifer, the snake from the garden of Eden, the beast and the dragon for revelations, etc. all morph into one character that we call Satan or the devil because it\u2019s easier to attribute all bad and evil things to one cosmic being (probably why that happened)\n\nSo over time Christians have given the name of Satan so much more power that the original meaning of the word, which I kind of adore out of absurdity and irony.",

I went to that highschool for the first three years but graduated from a different highschool. Because I was going to a different school, I thought I was never going to see my LO again so I confessed my limerence to her before our senior year started. She was very nice and understanding but it didn\u2019t help that much in the long run. After we graduated she moved out of state so I wasn\u2019t expecting to see her at the play. My friend pointed her out as she walked in (not knowing about my limerence). I didn\u2019t want to talk to her or even look at her but I walked by her unexpectedly in the hallway and she said \u201chey (my name)\u201d and so I said \u201chey\u201d back naturally. \n\nI was incredibly uneasy during the play, I almost felt like I was dreaming, it happened so fast and it had been so long since I\u2019d seen her in person it was hard to accept that it actually just happened. I called my sister to tell her about it because she knows about it all. I kept looking around after it ended to see if I could spot her but I couldn\u2019t.\n\nThis happened just a few hours ago and I feel like it\u2019s going to mess with me for a while, but I just needed to rant about it to people who understood.

Until one conversation.\n\nthrough the time i realised that not only males but also females are attractive to me. So I decided to inconspicuously ask about their opinion on LGBTQ community. The conversation went like this.\n\nMe: and btw what's your opinion on lgbt\n\nL(from her name) : that's weird\n\nMe: why? \n\nL: their prides and all\n\nMe: i understand your opinion but not everyone is like that. Not everyone is like that.\n\nL: i hate them it's just gross two men or two women \n\nMe: what would you do if someone in this group would be lgbt?\n\nL: (said something in that matter that she would like them less and that it's gross)\n\n i said, kinda in anger, that I don't want to be in same group with homophobe.\n\nL: you have to respect my opinion\n\nMe: what?? You disrespect whole thousands of people and we have to respect it? \n\n(My name) has left the group\n\nThey tried to bring me back but i refused. \n\nLater in other group where there were few people from that group, like 5 out of 15, without her, i said why i left, that i feel some attractivness toward females too and they undertood. But we forgot that her best friend is there and she said lgbt is weird for her too. I left that group too.\n\nAfter month approximately i got text from one member \n\nC: hey (my name). How are you doing?\n\nMe: ?\n\nC: ??\n\nMe: well i am ok\n\nC: wouldn't you mind to come back to group? L is not there anymore.\n\nMe: okay\n\nFirstly it was good but then they started to gossip about her. I participated but then i was feeling bad about it. I tried them to stop it but no. So i just didn't react to it. Firstly she didn't have us blocked but then she did it, like week ago. Her friend was there for some time but while C was  gossiping her she left. I felt bad about her, she was inbetween her best friend and us i don't judge her for choosing her. I wanted to apologize but i put it off for long time. AITA for this?"

Then when I say it it feels insincere to me even though It\u2019s usualy something I mean. I had a boyfriend who needed a lot of atention and affirmation. It made me feel like a cold bitch. I broke up with him because he begin to try to make me jealous to make sure I care about him. I was not jealous, i was pissed. If I didnt cared about him and didnt want him I would not make him such a huge part of my life, iI would not give him so much of my time and energy. He was not happy with me and I was not happy with him. I hope he will find someone dramatic enough who will cry out of love and passionately argue with him and I will have someone who will see in my action how much I love him and give me my space. Some with you guys.",

We don\u2019t get paid much. \nOur goverment has no idea how to make situation better and maka our economy stronger without absolutely milking working people. Social Insurance Institution takes like 1/4 of the money you make so they can give retirement money (theoreticaly to you in the future but  practicaly for currently old people). Even though we give a lot people get very law retirement pension. A lot of old people need to chose between food and medicines. It\u2019s like full on survival mode. So old people keep working as long as they can to have more money.\n2. Heath care \nIt is free but you have to wait realy long for your turn and I mean very long. For some types of medical examination you need to wait few months. For surgeries that are not an emergency even years. My uncle is waiting for his knee surgery for 14 years. And quality of those services. are realy bad. When my brother was in hospital for observation there was only one nurse for the whole ward which ment nobody observed him durring this observation. \n4. Taxes are realy high generaly.\nFor small business owners taxes are insane. \n5. Costs of living are high. \nMost people If they want to have a house or even a car have to take a loan. Quality of living is not as good as in west European countries. \nPolish people are realy hardworking but we want to have something from it. Abroad when you work hard you have more money, here you somehow still don\u2019t. Even before the war situation was not good but now It\u2019s realy bad. Money loses value because of inflation. Prises go up but sallary doesn\u2019t. Rent is crazy high now because we got 5 milion imigrants from Ukraine in a 38 milion country. It\u2019s difficult to find a job because suddenly there is much more people that need it and Ukrainians are exploited and often work for less (15 pln, 3,5 $ per hour even with minimum wage 19 pln). My friend works as a dental assistant 21 pln per hours, wanted 23 pln. Her boss said she can quit if she is not satisfied because he can get an Ukrainian in her place for 17 pln by tomorrow. And it\u2019s true.\nSo yeah it\u2019s only a good place for students and we actually have a lot of students from abroad but no people come to work here besides Ukrainians and Vietnamese which speaks for itself. Poland is a county you live in because you was born here not because it\u2019s great. And there is always a possibility that if Ukraine loses, Russia will atack Poland because that\u2019s basically what Putin said. Anyway, I\u2019m most likely moving to Dortmund in March. I\u2019m working on my German now. If UK didn\u2019t left EU and made it so difficult to migrate there I would  definitely already be there.",

Admittedly, I don't watch these people frequently, but from the times I have the \"gay humor\" was almost always just them pretending to be gay to get their friends or chat to react out of disgust. \n\nAs for racism, I know many black people think that it is impossible for them to be racist because they are marginalized. I disagree with that and I think it perpetuates this idea that black people can just say racist shit like speed and get away with no reprecussions. I think Bruce holds this viewpoint which is why I included him. Ionno about the others though. The fact that you can just say \"aww, not cool man :(\" to speed knowing damn well if a white person as popular as speed did that shit they wouldn't have a career in the morning exemplifies that.\n\nAnd sexism is as clear as fucking day for almost every streamer I mentioned . Kai refusing to give names to a rape victim in his own house, Adin's wannabe Andrew Tate shit, Speed with his \"who's gonna stop me\" and Valorant shit. Lmao, you'd have to be blind not to notice it.",

However, I just can't stop feeling anxious around ordering food and eating it in public places. I honestly have panic attacks every time I'm about to order something or step inside a restaurant. A lot of the time I don't have time for anything other than takeout because of school, but I panic to the point where I just don't eat during the entire day because I'm scared of ordering. \n\nEven though I've actually gone through with it and managed to order several times, it doesn't help. If anything, the anxiety just worsens after every visit. It makes me feel so helpless. It's been like this for 6 years."

Really the question you're asking here makes more sense when asking the other side of the fandom: if you want real-life politics, why are you so invested in a fictional world?\n\nLike I said somewhere else, you can have the Bible without God or Jesus, but then it would be a different book. Removing the core themes of a franchise deprives it of artistic integrity and color. Look at Game of Thrones's downward spiral, which was done because the core themes were sacrificed for the sake of immediate gratification. The Horus Heresy isn't intriguing because of the character's powers, it is compelling because of the constantly expanding relationships and politics that we get from it. The entire catalyst for 40k was the political and moral degradation of humanity. If there were no political messages or agendas in 40k, there would be no Horus Heresy. Media literacy, people. \n\n>And yet, just like Raxuis said, we watch shows to be entertained. The thing about Star Wars and the Matrix is that they are entertaining with or without their messages (not sure about Star Trek, I haven't watched it.) Even if every story has a political message lurking behind it, that message is never the point of a GOOD story. The point of any good story is to entertain. Also, I don't know who pulled it out of their ass that the Matrix is about gender transition, but if that was the original intent of the writers, then kudos to them for hiding it so well.\n\nAnd what you find entertaining is what's in your political comfort zone. If you're comforted by a piece of media, it's probably because it doesn't challenge your worldview. You're essentially saying that a house without a foundational frame is a good thing to build. The artists beliefs are the foundation of the art. Without those political messages, hidden or not, there would be no story. We've seen Star Wars and Star Trek movies without the politics. We've seen The Force Awakens and the Rise of Skywalker, and how they sweep the political details under the rug for entertainment's sake, and we've seen critics and audiences alike pan them for their shallowness and \" let's please everybody\" disposition. Story's can be about entertainment, but that's not the full picture, because a lot of the time, writing a story isn't an entertaining thing. It's hard work, and is often a product of deep introspection and a consistent application your beliefs and ideas. So no, you're wrong. Stories **are** their agendas.",

                "body": ">What message does minecraft force on me hmm? Or one punch man? Stargate?\n\n\nGlad you asked. Minecraft encourages creativity, free thinking and explorations. The agenda is pure creativity and curiosity, as Minecraft has actually had a big impact on how people express themselves in the modern age. One Punch Man has a ton of different characters with all sorts of unique dilemmas and character arcs, and Saitama is a bored character who has become too uncontrollably powerful. It delves a lot into the motivations, psychology and obsessions of the heroes and villains we see, and seeks to explore humanity. One Punch Man definitely has agendas, just not overtly left-leaning ones. Again, the media you watch is the media you generally agree with. That doesn't mean it doesn't \"force an agenda.\" I haven't actually seen anything from Stargate, but here's an excerpt about the premise from Wikipedia: \n\n*\"Stargate productions center on the premise of a \"Stargate\", a ring-shaped portal that enables rapid transportation via wormhole to other stargates that are located cosmic distances away. The story begins when one such device is discovered on Earth. The 1994 film and subsequent television series depict how the device is kept under the control of the United States government, who use it to conduct interplanetary missions by dialing the thousands of stargates located in the galaxy, which are the legacy of an ancient civilization. The expeditions originally had the goal of acquiring extremely rare resources, new technology and detecting threats; but often face scientific and humanitarian issues and the dilemmas of interacting with different societies. Finally, they resulted in a unified United Nation-coalition to better support the constant need to continue the program to defend Earth from invading aliens.\"* \n\nThat sounds *unbelievably* political. Are you joking? Better yet, what the actual hell do you mean by \"forcing\" a message? You don't have to watch anything you disagree with, stop strawmaning the other side. \n\n\n>To say Warhammer is nothing without a critic of facisim is an insult to the entire franchise, it is si much more than that. Furthermore and this frankly bugs me a lot. THE IMPERIUM IS NOT FACIST. It is a highly feudal government that I would akin to a oligarchy theocracy. It contains fascist elements yes, it contains communist elements. But to call it fascist is blanently wrong.\n\nThe definition of Fascism according to Wikipedia:\n\n*\"Fascism is a far-right, authoritarian, ultra-nationalist political ideology and movement, characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation and race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy.\"*\n\nThe Imperium is theocratic, but also undeniably fascist. It takes from fascist aesthetics, the Imperial Guard is a mix of various WW2 factions. You telling me this shows me how little you know about the politics that Warhammer draws from. The Fascist element is just as important as the religious element. By including exclusively the religious element, you ignore the fact that the Emperor of Mankind was literally just atheistic Xeno-Hitler. I get that Warhammer has more content than just Fascist critiques, but taking the political undertones from Warhammer 40k is like taking Jesus out of the New Testament. You remove a huge pillar of the series by doing this. Nothing can change the fact that every piece of Warhammer comes from a deeply scathing critique of authoritarianism. \n\n\n\n>Star trek I haven't really watched to much off but ultimately from what I've seen really doesn't bash your head with communist democracy good. Matrix I really don't understand about the gender transitioning at all. Pretty sure it was just about people living in a simulation within another simulation.\n\nThe directors of the Matrix themselves confirmed the Trans metaphor. Star Trek literally does lol. \n\n>And honestly I would argue that with the imperium it more on about the rich living extravagant and easy lives while the lot of the poor is to serve them and to be nothing more than a cog in a machine. \n\nThat's one of the core parts of Fascism, though. There's a reason why Communism is basically the ideological opposite of Fascism. \n\n>Star wars is more about space wizards using mind tricks and space terrorist are apparently good guys. \n\nGeorge Lucas based the rebels off of Vietnam rebels fighting America. That was very much a political statement. How are you not seeing this? Yeah, there's also the themes of family and responsibility, but to ignore the clear political undertones is disingenuous and ignorant. \n\n>And south park is exactly what I ment by some media i watch because I know what they are going to try and do. Like yes south park makes fun of current things on purpose. And if I watch south park I'm not mad that they do it. It's the point of the show.\n\nBut it doesn't disprove my point. Nothing you've said has proven me wrong, because the idea that all of these things have an underlying worldview and perspective woven into them still stands. The Imperium is textbook fascism with religious undertones (quite like the Nazis and their pseudo-Catholicism and ideas of a superior human ideal,) and 40k is, at it's core, is a critique of fascism and authoritarianism.",

It is literally nothing without it's criticism of fascism. That alone opens all sorts of pathways for discussion. \n\n>Like ah yes this character is deus ex machina political correct character and that's the only thing that's about them. And ignore the the grimdark aspect side of things. And force the audience on a hyper focus of things. \n\nWhat on Earth are you even referring to here? Warhammer is literally ALL deus-ex-machina main characters. Every faction has a bullshit, ultra-powered mascot attached to it, that's by design because overpowered characters are cool. If you're gonna complain about the power scaling of characters, 40k is the last thing you wanna get in bed in. Again, I ask: why are you into 40k?\n\n>My 2 cents on the matter is this. I watch the show to be entertained. Not deal with anyone's message pushing. There are certain media's which I will watch that are message pushing. But I am aware of it and expect it from the start.\n\nEverything is a reflection of the creator's beliefs. That's the nature of art and writing. It is very hard to differentiate the writer and the writing for a reason. Star Wars is based on George Lucas's anti-imperialism, Star Trek was based on left-wing philosophy, The Matrix was a metaphor for gender transitioning and revolution. South Park is meant to lampoon the cynical, vile world we live in, and how we can cope with that through laughter and parody. Everything you know, whether it's preaching to you or not, has an agenda behind it. Everything you find entertaining fits into your agenda. You are actively pushing a message by not pushing a message. You can't escape it, because you are the messages that have been engrained in you.  So why not just admit it to yourself? You don't like it when certain shows get political because they disagree with you, and you disagree with them. And quite frankly, I'm tired of hearing media get criticized for being \"political,\" because that's not a criticism.",

                "body": "Here's the forum I copy-pasted from someone else's type-me form lol. This is going to be very tangential and unrelated, but it's like that to show you how I see reality and my ideas. So if some things overlap, that's why: to show you my unedited perspective.\n\nTo show ya'll my type history, my main types seem to be xNxPs of some kind, but I could see ISxP or ISxJ. I'm certain I have NeSi, what with my natural disassociation from the real world and love of stories, ideas and general fiction. With that out of the way:\n\n**How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**\n\nI'm a 19 year old male with a constantly shifting internal world. I feel like I have no identity, no place anywhere, yet also with the ability to fill any role I want, even if it's only in my own head and nowhere else. I'm fairly habitual, yet I have no real sense of structure. In my dormant moments, my life is a tornado, and reality itself feels like a chore to deal with sometimes.\n\n**Is there a medical diagnosis that impacts your mental/compartmental stability somehow?**\n\nI have ADHD of the inattentive variety. I'm not hyperactive, and  I'm generally the \"chilled out weirdo\" in most social settings. I also have massive bouts of disassociation, to the point where I feel completely detached form my surroundings. The fact that I have used psychedelics and marijuana probably influences this, but this sense of unreality has ALWAYS been a common theme in my life. Even when my  head is entirely empty, I'm experiencing my mind through the lenses of \"the moment,\" not the \"actual world.\" I have trouble really holding anything that doesn't \"tickle my interest bone,\" and I have only a couple of consistent interests: art.\n\n**Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**\n\nMy upbringing was pretty good overall.\u00a0 I grew up with my mom, dad, and older brother. Most of us are fiscally conservative, but I've always drifted around the political spectrum. My relationship with faith is debatably more complex. Ultimately, my family life is not impacted by my beliefs, and despite any arguments, we all get along well.\n\n**What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**\n\nI don't have one yet. Not out of fear (as others who now me may suspect, I am a very self-isolating person with a very habitual and under-stimulating way of living.) I'm just hilariously bad with details, and I get bored easily. I want to do nothing but drive the countryside with my computer, art supplies and a friend, getting to know the people around me and sharing everyone's perspective. However, the idea of having to settle down permanently with a job, a specific set of people, it drains me. Whenever I'm stagnant (which is currently where I am right now,) I feel unoriginal, stale and lifeless. Frankly, I feel depressed in the purest sense of the word. Even worse, I feel like if I get a job, I may miss out on several important details. My tendency to complicate things down to the sentences people speak is mistaken for arrogance and flakiness, and my personality doesn't mesh well with much in the \"real world.\"\n\n**If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**\n\nI would both be refreshed and lonely. For one, I would definitely enter an emotionally melancholic state of mind. I would probably listen to nostalgic Undertale music, cry on the inside and ponder the meaning of life, as well as experience itself. Reality, memories, the essence of life, its all so confusing, so scary. But that scariness is worth it if it means I can simply understand everything. Hell, give me a nice liminal space, a pair of earbuds and a phone, a notepad to draw/write on and I'll get really, really existential.\n\n**What is your relation with movement and your surroundings? For instance, do you prefer a sport or outdoors event? If an outdoors event, what is it? And why? If not, what type of activities do you tend to engage in?**\n\nI'm a very \"stationary\" person. I dislike being pushed around, and I come off as very \"detached.\" However, by far my greatest sense is my hearing. I compare myself to daredevil for that reason. I'm very overstimulated and put off by loud, intense noises, sensations and my body. I do love walking, though. Nature is a good source for inspiration, and it lets the images that play in my mind flow seamlessly.\n\n**How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**\n\nI would say I am very curious, but the more I've secluded myself, the more I've stagnated mentally. I clearly still \"know\" a lot, I like useless factoids and things like astronomy and meteorology. Anything that involves a \"framework of reality itself\" scenario appeals to me, like quantum physics, the fourth dimension, time, simulations, \"fake realities,\" etc. I'm a very conceptual person, and those kinds of ideas inspire me. However, I don't feel like slogging through all of the details. Cold, hard facts rarely appeal to me anymore, now I want to know people. I don't mind small talk, because it allows me to pick up on micro-expressions easily. It's a good appetizer to the meal of someone's full, complete identity. I get a massive kick out of fractals and repeating patterns, and because of that, alternate realities and math interest me, but not to the point of getting into the nitty-gritty. Having everything revealed at once is not only overwhelming, but it also takes away from the tension and curiosity that some with it. If  I can't imagine what these beautiful frameworks could hold, if I can't make a drama out of it, there's no essence behind it, no color. It's just \"cold, hard facts\" that melt before the fire that is my head and heart.\n\n**Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**\n\nArt is a MASSIVE fixture of my identity. The principles, the meaning of it, the beautiful colors and messages. It's all so appealing. More than anything, art allows me to do something beautiful, something nothing else truly, TRULY can. It makes me bring possibilities to life. It helps give them form, it helps give them meaning, it helps give the subject of my art personality and character, an identity. It helps me express of of these transcendent ideas of good and evil, light and dark, the harmless and wholesome and the dark and disturbing. Simply put, it gives me ideas. However, I don't really finish any of my art, and finalizing a vision is extremely hard. I either go through cycles of perfectionism, or I leave it too unfinished or undetailed. In fact, art is one of the ONLY things I truly feel the need to perfect. As of late, particularly during the past year, I've been drawing my favorite DND character repeatedly because no matter what, my vision for his design, personality, role, etc has all been different. It's like, even though I'm focusing on one thing, there is a literal multiverse of these characters living in my head. It's actually symbolic in a way, because this character is supposed to be a self-insert, a reflection of my pros and cons, my personality. It's like I'm tinkering with myself, like I'm discovering an entirely new person and getting completely lost. It is literally one of the ONLY projects I've consistently stuck to.\n\n**What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**\n\nThere's no such thing as time for me. It's like everything is a soup of events and non-sequential happenings that I can't keep track of. All of t is something I look at as simultaneously beautiful and terrifying. It feels like I'm missing everything, and that I'm living in a void separated from the course of history. I never take time to experience anything, and when I actually DO manage to become attuned with the present moment, I physically feel ***MISERABLE.*** My body feels weird, uncomfortable, like my muscles and skin are all crawling. I feel like my body is revolting against me, and I start to get images of horrible physical distortions in my head. Imagine a bad psychedelic trip. Of course, this is a much more poetic description of my experience of reality, but it's a good approximation of how I feel. I feel like I'm \"passing through\" the present moment, and I'm only left with a weird soup of feeling and intuitions about the past and future. Whenever I enter reality, my soul feels uncomfortable in my body.\n\n**Do you need logical consistency in your life?**\n\nYes. Logic and truth is an unattainable effort on my part, as I'm simultaneously the most hyper logical POS of all time, or the hyper emotional, passionate defender of my beliefs. Most people see me as a chilled out weirdo stuck in his weird little fantasy world as much as he is his drawing pad. However, much of my drawings are like blueprints and \"test runs.\" I'm usually working on posing, armor and weapon designs, writing scenes for stories I'll never complete, character concepts, etc. I love when the framework behind magic, superpowers and weapons are explained to me, and my ideal partner is someone who'll geek out with me over sword designs and worldbuilding ideas. In terms of practical, mathematic logic, I'm godawful. I'm the King of Semantics, but not the Aristocratic Arithmetician. Being an *enlightened agnostic(TM)* that I am, I love philosophical consistency as well, and I frequently get into religious, political and philosophical debates that I am completely unprepared for because \"it's fun.\" Don't get me wrong, I usually take the place of a pissed off ~~extremist~~ Devil's Advocate, but looking back on it, angry debates are funny, and they help me navigate the unpleasant situations in life with a wink and a smile.\n\n**How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**\n\n\"Efficiency?\" What kind of name is that?\"\n\nIn all seriousness, I suck at efficiency. I have no practical abilities, no mechanical skill, and terrible leadership/direction following skills. I am a useless man, if that's what you want me for. My room is a garbage dump, my clothes are disorganized, and I just kind meander around like a fool. If I were less bored and lazy, I would 100 percent be capable of anything...accept cleaning...\n\nFuck cleaning.\n\n**Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**\n\nNot really. But I don't follow, either. Albert Camus's quote on this sums it up very well:\n\n*\u201cDon't walk in front of me\u2026I may not follow. Don't walk behind me, I may not lead. Walk beside me\u2026just be my friend.\u201d*\n\nI take an almost completely equal view of everyone, for better and for worse. I consider myself a tolerant person at the very least. Aside from some of the prejudices that could be attributed to country living, I love meeting new people, letting them talk to me about their life, their interests, what makes them tick. A big fantasy of mine is driving around the USA with a friend, some mind recreational drugs, and the will to communicate with everyone anywhere. I hate controlling anything just as much as I hate being controlled. However, I tend to take on an \"I can fix them\" mentality sometimes, and it can lead me to sometimes follow an awkward relationship or situation (not bad so far, but it can get awkward.) Many might see me as submissive, but I just kinda \"go with it.\" I'm very apathetic to my surroundings, more focused on my mind and internal state, I'm a very introspective person, and I like thinking about the things in life that are important to me, even if it means missing out on what's right in front of me. I like predicting people's moves, but if I'm wrong, so be it. \"There's an opportunity to be right waiting for me elsewhere\" is a common motto of mine.\n\n**What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**\n\nArt, writing, video games, mind/strategy games, mindlessly surfing the web, music, deep discussions, astronomy (and other sciences depending on the season,) random video essays, reading, etc. Almost all kinds of art interest me. Abstract art confuses me, but that's what I love about it. It's like a metaphor for my life: a mess. A good mess, but a mess nonetheless. I love almost all types of media, and though there isn't a whole lot I'm invested in on a fictional level, I'm working on my own stories and worlds that are heavily inspired by what I love. Indie games inspire me a lot, and I went through massive Undertale and FNAF phases as I grew up, both being exactly the things that I needed (and still do.) They make me want to write or create something that will bring joy to the world.\n\n**What's important to you and why?**\n\nOnce again, I point to:\n\n*\u201cDon't walk in front of me\u2026I may not follow. Don't walk behind me, I may not lead. Walk beside me\u2026just be my friend.\u201d*\n\nFriendship means everything, not family or culture. I don't love my parents because they're my parents, I love them because they listen to me and respect who and what I am, even if I am a lazy, snarky and often lofty person. Deep discussions are everything to me, and if you don't wanna do that, that's fine. I'm just not the right person for you. I also strongly value creativity and artistic integrity.\n\n**What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**\n\nWhile structure is more \"beneficial\" to me than not, I absolutely despise it. My dad (definitely an ExTx type,) constantly wars with me over the merit of practical, tangible structure vs my \"take it easy\" approach, and I tend to hate absolutely anything that tries to infringe on what I think or do. I'm definitely a \"walk to the beat of my own drum\" person. I tend to learn by brainstorming/watching other people brainstorm. It gives me inspiration, and some of my greatest ideas come from me listening to people, playing/watching/reading movies/video games/articles, and many other things. I also love utilizing science and technology in the stories I write, often intertwining them with magic and  fantasy elements.\n\n**How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**\n\nI'm definitely a schemer, but I'm not a planner or strategizer. I'm a very go with the flow person, and I tend to despise too much structure. I'm definitely an improviser, but one who generally likes a lot of alone-time and prep-time, as I mainly deal in hypotheticals and possibility-oriented scenarios, whereas I flounder in immediate strategy or tactical matters.\n\n**What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**\n\nI have practically no professional ambitions, only personal ambitions. I want to refine myself to the point where no perspective offends me, mainly because I've been told I can be arrogant, self-absorbed or full of my own intellect/hubris. These types of comments destroy me, because I invest every ounce of my social energy tailoring myself to people, making sure that I can resent my truest self in a way that others like, admire, or will want to be friends with. Now, I don't want to \"belong,\" but I do want to be friends with people, to be able to drift around everywhere and learn their lifestyles. Really, it isn't me \"tailoring\" myself to others as much as it is literally assimilating different identities (be it from people, fictional characters, MBTI types) into one singular whole. I'm a composite human because I like learning, because I want the most multi-faceted understanding of myself as much as possible. I am not \"one thing,\" the fact that my dormant moments are a constant existential/identity crisis is proof of this.\n\nIn other words, I purely seem to focus on the introspective sides of life. I'm never bored in my head, eve if I'm bored. I'm always trying to solve problems, simplify the web of complex identity issues I go through. It's as if I'm walking on a field of perfectly arranged eggshells, only I'm wearing weighted, steel-tipped boots. Inevitably I'll break one, and inevitably I'll run into problems, but the problems make life interesting. My lack of identity makes life interesting.\n\n**What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**\n\nI definitely have my moments of overthinking, paranoia, and scatteredness. I don't like dark, silent places, and given my issues with hearing, my senses tend to go on overdrive. However, I actually really like this paranoia. I feel like I'm in a horror movie, even if in the moment it's absolutely terrifying, I tend to make mountains of molehills, be it accidentally or for my own amusement. A common theme with me is taking a step back from my consciousness and laughing at it. Life to me is a joke in many ways, and even in my moments or peril and fear, I approach it internally with a laugh.\n\n**What do the \"highs\" in your life look like?**\n\nI'm usually really hyperactive, creative and original, spouting jokes that nobody understands and having my mind run a mile a minute. I'm a very under-stimulated person mentally, so getting a hold of anything that makes me feel like a kid in a candy store is a wonderful feeling. I, quite literally, feel \"high,\" and I can become very sanguine and expressive, ,often leaving sentences unfinished and tasks incomplete. When I'm happy, I'm like a tornado of activity and ideas.\n\n**What do the \"lows\" in your life look like?**\n\nMy head is empty and blank, and my body feels decrepit, like I've aged 30 years in mere seconds. I feel like static permeates my being, and I begin to hype-fixate on my body, thoughts, and my surroundings, or more specifically, the effect they have on my body. I feel every twitch of a muscle, every imperfection, every bump or bruise, every unknown scratch. I get very paranoid of my health and appearance, and I can go hours simply checking myself for illness, mental impairment, and discomfort I despise pain, and too much pleasure melds into pain. It's often to the point where I straight-up can't tell the difference between pain and pleasure, and it causes me to panic. I need \"momentum,\" mental momentum particularly. External, sensory progress is nice, and something I vibe with, but I need understanding, to contemplate the path its heading down rather than experience it.\n\nMy lows come when I'm consciously \"experiencing\" reality as it is, not what it \"might\" be.\n\n**How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**\n\nI can definitely \"experience\" and accept reality as it is. I can also slam my big toe with a sledgehammer, that doesn't mean I want to or feel good when I do, and I only engage with my surroundings in a rushed way, as if I'm trying to answer a necessary question as quickly as possible to avoid it. Reality is nice, but nothing beats taking the \"distant\" perspective, the disassociated perspective. I need reality to be a playground, not \"reality.\" In fact, when I'm paying attention to my surroundings, I feel like I'm separated from my element, from my essence. The world around me, it's imposing presence, it makes me sick to my stomach, and triggers the hypochondria and hypersensitivity I mentioned earlier. I frequently get pegged as unrealistic, illogical and aloof for this reason, particularly by the xSTx types in my life (mainly of the extroverted variety.)\n\n**Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**\n\nIt's funny, because my bedroom is kinda like this. Granted, it's a total mess with plenty of belongings and objects of sentimental worth, but I don't really \"do\" much. What matters is that it's mine, and that i \"own\" it. It's like a manifestation of my \"mind palace\" in real life: cluttered, messy, slightly Non-Euclidean...\n\nBut to get back on track, once again, it depends on if it feels as if I \"own it,\" or in other terms, that I chose to enter it. I want to be able to make my own choices, I want to make sure that I'm an individual with the ability to entertain myself wherever I go, be it a blank room or a massive room filled with amazing objects with a ton of potential. I'll lock myself in a broom closet, but I will not be locked in a gymnasium, if that makes sense.\n\n**How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**\n\nI tend to take so long making a choice that inevitably, some people just choose for me. That's another thing contributing to the \"lack of ownership\" I feel in my life, it's as if I live in a predetermined world, and I'm just along for the ride. I may even break out, but for now, I'm subject to the powers of good/bad luck. I'm OK with this, some people are designed to lead, others are designed to follow. I'm designed to reside in that uncanny valley, I feel. Life is so much larger than any of our imaginations, and to me, decision-making is trivial at best, only existing to serve me, a small atom in a sea of matter. I exist as a part of a greater force that we can never know, so why bother trying to nail the details when no matter how closely or far away you look, there is only a \"big picture,\" like a fractal that appears the same at every angle or distance?\n\n**How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**\n\nI am generally very even-tempered and phlegmatic on the outside, but my internal word is everything. Feelings of enjoyment, love, passion, anger, sadness, melancholy, everything is there and everything exists at once, which is why I think I exist in such an even-tempered, silent way. I feel like everything I express gets lost in translation, and that's OK. Frustrating, but OK. As for how important they are, it depends. Like I said, I am not a \"self-motivated\" person who actively seeks to fulfill their own desires, I'm just kind of along for the ride. The way I see it, when it comes to identity, emotions, beliefs, etc., I'll just kinda go along with whatever's presented to me with equal amounts of curiosity, acceptance and tolerance. If there's one thing I'm not, is unwilling to investigate every possibility, especially if it contributes to the larger goal of \"completing\" the ever-expanding internal puzzle that is my identity and state-of-mind. In many ways, a good way to describe me is as a \"believer.\"\n\n**Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**\n\nIt isn't so much who I'm with so much as it is where I am. In real life, I'm polite, quiet, easygoing and hilariously accepting and impressionable. On the other hand, I am borderline vengeful on the internet. I'll be nice to those who disagree with me as long as they return the favor. If not, prepare to be roasted over the fire of pseudo-intellectualism and arrogance! Much of the time, I'm not even prepared enough to talk or debate with people on a given subject, and I'm bad at learning to let defeat go in these settings. I'm like two different people, \"real\" me and internet me.\n\n**Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**\n\nOnly if I either respect the rules or fear the consequences. I have a standard moral compass, issues of murder, rape, assault, the basics, all of those things are the worst things a human can do to another conscious, sentient being with feelings and ideas of their own. However, when it comes to little things, I can be a scheming little gremlin. For example, I'll find ways to evade punishment, and I'm not very disciplined or controlled. I go with the flow in almost all aspects, after all. Now, if breaking a rule hurts the feelings of another person, I'm practically lawful-neutral. I go from carefree, aloof and translucent to stone-cold, struct and pedantic. Harming the innocent is a no-no."

This doesn't happen with meats or veggies, but with really sweet stuff, I still get a psychedelic/reality bending moment of overwhelming unity between the rest of my body and my taste buds. I have a history with pickiness and a general hatred of most intense sensations, or at least an uneasiness. Even leasure and pain can be hard to gauge on occasion, so I usually just stick with comfortable and slow situations that allow me to introspect and think. Maybe my senses are \"talking revenge\" on me? \n\nIs this a weird type of synesthesia, sensory overload, or just me misinterpreting a normal bodily function?

The sane happens when I view a horror movie with extensive gore or slow scenes of mutilation. Even the word \"sensation\" can cause a jolt throughout my body, almost as if I'm being overstimulated somewhere in the \"back\" of my body. It doesn't even come down to normal fear or squeamishness, its like I can barely feel what's happening to the person. I can't call it an empathy thing, because whenever I see something physical happen to another person, nothing really happens to me.

I was searching the subreddit for which electives are the most beneficial as a CS student and it seemed like the parallel programming course was one people really enjoyed taking. However, when I was searching the \\[eCatalog\\]([https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/soc/ecatalog/ecourselist.htm?termcode=all&subject=CS](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/soc/ecatalog/ecourselist.htm?termcode=all&subject=CS)) and I noticed I could not find CS 475 anywhere, but I've seen posts on this subreddit as early as 2 month ago talking about it, but I haven't seen anything discussing CS 475 being discontinued.\n\nIs it still being offered at this time? I did notice the subreddit has posts talking about the restructuring of some courses so I'm not sure if I have the latest information. If there is a place I can refer to that I am unaware of please let me know.\n\nI had the following planned in terms of electives using \\[this list\\]([https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/academic/online-cs-postbacc](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/academic/online-cs-postbacc)) to see the required coursework. I do have a second option in case CS 475 isn't offered:\n\nOption 1:\n\n* CS 361: Software Engineering I (not sure why a prerequisite for a required course is not on the required courses list. I'm not sure if the list I linked above is correct)\n* CS 381: Programming Language Fundamentals\n* CS 475: Introduction to Parallel Programming \n\nOption 2:\n\n* CS 361: Software Engineering I\n* CS 372: Introduction to Computer Networks (prerequisite for CS 493)\n* CS 493: Cloud Application Development\n\nI'm still planning out what I would like to take as I'm still new to this program so this list is subject to change as I look into the courses throughout my time studying."

I see two potential issues that could be easily corrected. \n\n1.\tThat is an unnecessarily long span between the bearing points where a beam would inevitably hold up that second floor area. I would extend the hallway wall by the dining area or living area to be long enough for that beam to bear on. That cuts a few feet out of the span and hopefully a little depth and expense from the beam. \n2.\tAs it stands the other end of the beam frames into your exterior wall directly above a window. It would be ideal for there to be solid wall under the beam. It could technically bear over a window, but that would complicate things. You could move your window to miss the beam above, or move the end of the second floor area to miss the window - or a little bit of both. \n\nI saw you had already gotten lots of feedback on the spaces so I thought I'd point out something a little different. I hope it helps.",

Your family is who you choose. You don't owe somebody something just because they did the bare minimum raising you and hold it over your head. You don't have to walk on eggshells in order to appease someone and keep them from going off on a childish tirade. You don't need to play their games. Look out for yourself. Be your own person.

Most of the floor area is carpet but there is some wood imitation laminate flooring and also some tile floors. I also have a couple area rugs in the living room and my bedroom. Would the floor level changes be an issue for these robots? Would the different floor surface types be a limiting factor in which one I get? \n\nI saw that there are some robots that also have a mop feature but that is not a necessity. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions or relatable experience that you wouldn't mind sharing.

I've been to a lot of the local diners and shops downtown, for instance, but it's been a while since I've been there so what are some places that are newer or maybe some old classics like Hyde Brothers Books or Firefly Coffee House?"

I have been involved in sports my whole life, and am a volunteer firefighter for my county, so the stress of the job and being a good teammate isn\u2019t a big fear of mine, it\u2019s the worry that I will fail my team and not be a competent operator that has been giving me doubts about this career field.

I apologize if this topic has been covered, but it has been weighing on my mind like crazy ever since I got serious about this.

I have a small amount of toenail fungus on my left big toe that I took medication for (Terbinafine) and it is now growing out, but my recruiter told me to wait until it\u2019s completely gone to go to meps so I don\u2019t risk getting disqualified over it. Fair enough, I see his point, so I decided to wait it out, even though it\u2019s a small amount. So after getting that taken care of, I got an ear infection and took amoxicillin for it, and it finally healed but there is still a small amount of fluid in my ear and the ear canal is swollen, causing my hearing to not be 100%. Not a big deal, as I still have to wait for my toenail to grow out anyways. The problem is now my parents are being super pushy about me applying for and filling out scholarships just in case I get disqualified (I won\u2019t, I literally just have to wait until my ear and toenail have healed). I mean pushy to the point that my mom has been screaming at me over it, and my dad has threatened to ground me from everything until I fill them out. Big boy problems, I know. Bring on the jokes. My mom keeps accusing me of being lazy and putting it off, but I just don\u2019t see the point in filling them out and potentially taking them away from someone else that actually needs them. And it\u2019s literally a complete waste of time, I\u2019m 100% committed to enlisting, and my health is 100% except the toenail and ear, so I won\u2019t have a problem with meps. The recruiter has double checked everything and told me I\u2019m good to go once I heal up. I have tried telling my parents this, but they say I just keep making up excuses. I was hoping that some of you could give me advice on what to do here. I have gotten the vibe from them that they want me to apply for scholarships just so they can brag about them to other parents. My mom has brought up repeatedly how embarrassing it\u2019s going to be when I follow my classmates onto the podium at graduation who are getting full rides and sports scholarships and all the crap I don\u2019t care about, and then \u201cso and so- plans on entering the Air Force\u201d Neither of my parents were military, so they really don\u2019t understand it at all, but it\u2019s just so frustrating. I have gone over this situation over and over in my head and I just can\u2019t see what the right thing to do is. I was hoping that someone here could give me some solid advice. Should I just bite the bullet and fill them out, even though it\u2019s literally pointless?"

I haven\u2019t been in a real relationship, and I really don\u2019t have many friends. I\u2019m a total virgin, and I haven\u2019t even kissed a girl despite the fact that I\u2019m 18.

It\u2019s to show you that there are other people struggling with you. Things have been looking up recently, and they are going to continue to get better. After all that time, I had fallen into a hole that I knew I had to get out of. I started focusing on improving myself and my negative line of thinking. Along my self improvement journey I gained confidence and decided to follow my dreams. I joined the volunteer fire department of my town, which was super unusual for someone of my age. I was then surrounded by supportive people who had a similar interest in helping others. I built connections there that led to me getting an awesome job that not many teens have the opportunity to have. I get paid really well, have an awesome boss, and get to work on and learn about cars all day. And since my self esteem has grown and I focus more on how I present myself and come off to others, I have been getting a lot of positive female attention. Do I still struggle? Absolutely. I have no true friends, and am still a hopeless romantic. I also still doubt myself all the time, and overthink everything. But guess what? I was in a dark place and I pushed through. I am not special or unique, you can do the same thing. So to all of you really struggling, I ask that you give it more time. If you are at rock bottom, the only direction you can go is up. It may seem daunting and hopeless, but I promise there are people there to help you up and want you to succeed. I love and care for each and every one of you, so please, just wait. Things WILL improve. Hugs and best wishes to all of you. \u2764\ufe0f If anybody wants to talk, don\u2019t be afraid to DM me. I want every single person here to succeed and live long, happy lives."

Which would be normal but I find it weird how I could fall asleep after being so awake. I also had no recollection of my dream and I usually can remember them.  I fall asleep again. In the middle of the night I am awaken by a crashing sound beside me like something hit my nightstand so I look around in the dark and don't see anything then go back to sleep. Here is where it gets weird. When I wake up I cannot find my glasses and everything on the nightstand is in different positions. I spend 5 minutes looking for my glasses only to find them on the opposite side of my room. How the hell did this happen? It's not like I kicked my nightstand in my sleep because I can't reach it. Also I remember hearing voices in a whisper at some point in the night. Although I think it was a dream. And as far as I know I'm not Schizophrenic. Someone care to give me a theory?"

Symptoms tend to occur during moderate efforts, or after excessive sollicitation of a group of muscles (for example triceps weakness/spasms after carrying a bag of groceries or leaning on it). There is no predominant location for my symptoms.\n\nI also had some episodes of hand clumsiness (had trouble using my keys or a pen) but I had attributed my symptoms to excessive sollicitation (I play lots of PC games that require using a mouse. Never had the same symptoms on my left hand). Symptoms were temporary though. \n\nMy muscles start shaking sometimes (abdominals for example when I'm lying down and trying to pick up something without moving from bed)\n\nTried to rule out evident causes of generalized muscle weakness. Here are some elements to help you understand the context:\n\n\\- I'm going through a very important academic year (6th year of medschool) though I might be more anxious than usual. I usually drink 2-3 cups of coffee a day but i stopped every source of caffeine since a few days.\n\n\\- My sleep schedule is ok, with an average 8-9 hours of sleep per night. I frequently wake up at night though.\n\n\\- No other health condition except a chronic sinusitis since a few months ; normal CT scan and labs. No mineral deficiency, thyroid is ok.\n\n\\- Haven't trained gone to gyms for several months (4-5ish) even though I have a kind of active lifestyle. I try to eat healthy as much as I can but I also eat lots of junkfood.\n\nSo here are my questions : Is it normal to experience muscular weakness/twitches in this context? Can anxiety and lack of sports explain my symptoms all by themselves? Especially when I have normal labs? I am really freaked out about contracting ALS or other neurological debilitating disease.\n\nThank you in advance for your answers and advice."

When  there's only 1 earbud in it or when it's empty, the light is green and not blinking.\n\nWhen trying to reset the case or putting it in pairing mode, the light just goes off instead of becoming white and flashing as usual. \n\nI also tried to clean up the earbuds and case which had no effect.\n\nI was wondering if I had to purchase a new case (which would piss me off considering the fact that I just bought a new left earbud - the total would cost nearly as much as a new set of AirPods Pro)\n\nDo you have any solutions for this please ?\n\nI was thinking about letting the case run out of battery and try to charge it again (btw what is the best way to use the case's battery?) \n\nOR trying to sync my 2 earbuds with my friend's case so they are recognized by my phone and only use my case to reload them.\n\nDo you have any suggestions or answers ?\n\nThank you in advance"

The thing is they seem so confident about their knowledge that it can be really hard to doubt them or to contradict their argument.\n\nThat kind of 'I know everything' people can easily be spotted because they often have some common personality traits in addition to some typical behaviors or answers.\n\nIn a debate, they will most likely use authoritative arguments as 'I know what I'm talking about, I've read about this'. That kind of argument sucks because it can roughly be denied.\n\nThat behavior is due to a cognitive bias: the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability. It is related to the cognitive bias of illusory superiority and comes from the inability of people to recognize their lack of ability. Without the self-awareness of metacognition, people cannot objectively evaluate their competence or incompetence.\n\nIn conclusion: always make your OWN research!"

So far this year, Eli has been absent from events. Everyone else has been open about expressing their frustrations behind his back but never to his face. Allen/Eva hosted a small party last month, choosing the date/time to work around Eli's schedule. But Eli never showed up. Everyone was pretty upset, but as most of the group is conflict-averse, nobody said anything about it. I felt that keeping our frustrations pent-up wouldn't lead to any change, so I called him out in the GC for not coming, to which he said he'd get better about it.\n\nLately, Allen/Eva have started being tardy/absent from events. Charlie&I hosted a small Halloween party last weekend. Allen/Eva were over 3 hours late, and Eli didn't show up until after the party ended. Jack&Charlie were upset about the lateness but didn't say anything to them. They were sorry about being late and said to make up for it, we should all get together the next weekend. We spent the week finding dates, times, and things to do that worked for everyone and settled on Sunday past 7pm.\n\nSunday came and at 6:40, Allen/Eva text the group saying that something suddenly came up and they wouldn't be able to make it. Charlie&Jack expressed their frustrations to me but told them it was alright. Wanting to hold them accountable since nobody else would, I asked, \"What came up?\" Eva said it was nothing we needed to worry about. I probed further, saying they could at least share the reason they're not coming since we'd had these plans for so long.\n\nPrivately, Eli messaged me saying to let it go. I said it's been disrespectful for him to not show up to events and it's disrespectful that they're cancelling last minute. I pointed out how it's become a pattern that the 3 of them are late/absent from events. He said I wasn't acting like myself and that I could take my anger out on him but to not lash out on the rest of the group. I responded that I'd appreciate if he'd acknowledge my points instead of dismissing it as anger/lashing out. I told him he hasn't been a reliable friend, and now he was defending them for being unreliable friends.\n\nMeanwhile, Eva responded in the GC apologizing again for cancelling but said that they don't owe us any explanation since it's private. I apologized for what I said, saying it wasn't my intention to pry, just to hold them accountable. I talked about how unreliable they (+Eli) have been lately and how nobody is happy with it despite saying otherwise, and I'm speaking for almost everyone by calling them out, & while it's okay if priorities lie outside of the friend group, I also felt it should be okay for any of us to openly express our disappointment. I talked to Charlie later that night, and he said he disagreed with my approach.\n\nWhat do you think, Reddit? AITA?"

I\u2019m curious if you guys have ever heard anything similar from your nparents.\n\n\u201cYou only remember the last four years when we lived together, and you didn't like me much then. Because of that, because I tried to be a father to teach you things your mother didn't, I felt that I lost you. Everything I had built with you before then, before our divorce...a positive foundation, with lots of love and acceptance and approval \u2013 seemed to be gone. You don't have any memory of it, and because of that you seem to see me as no better than your mother who tried to physically hurt you. From your comments the other night sometimes I wonder if you see me as worse, because you explained that mom had an excuse: she couldn't control herself.\n\nIt was not how our life was supposed to be. I never thought I'd have to face the fact that I'd never be a special daddy to my special [my name]...instead, it seems I will be resented for the past four years from now on. If I'm not all that special to you anymore, I guess I understand better why now. You come over to visit because I ask you to and you do that, perhaps, out of obligation and not really out of love.\n\nNow I think I understand why I don't rank as high on your priority list. I'm not that special anymore, and it breaks my heart that, in trying to teach you what I thought I had to when we lived together, it seemed to irreparably harm our relationship. I just want to challenge you, sometime in your future, through therapy designed to search your past memories, to find what you lost with me. All those years before we lived together, and you remember none of it? It's just so beyond sad to me.\n\nSomething else: one thing I realize is that, even though you said you'd forgiven me, perhaps I have yet to forgive you. I'm really not a bad parent like you want me to be. Yes, there's no question I set up rules you didn't like, and as a child you passively acted against them by not doing what was expected. Everyday I came home and I could see that you didn't do anything to help me with our rules. I took that as massive sign of disregard and disrespect and, basically, a passive middle-finger sent my way.\nIf I was the bad parent you feel I was, perhaps then you were really the bad daughter you don't want to admit to? Perhaps we could have worked better together and not have caused resentment to the other.\n\nI don't want to believe that...I love you too much. But...if the reality is that, after all this is said and done, you don't feel there's a special dad/daughter relationship there to build on...we're doomed. And...it's really nothing that I can fix... So, looking at our situation, you hadn't asked me for forgiveness for your actions while YOU were in total control and responsible for your choices. There had been no reason to forgive you because you hadn't asked. Christ set the example for forgiveness. If I want His forgiveness, I turn to Him, recognize that I did wrong and need His forgiveness. From there, I ask Him and He gives it. If I didn't ask, I wouldn't get it. So, now, I am asking for your forgiveness for anything I did that was hurtful to you.\u201d\n\ni\u2019m currently LC with my dad, heavily considering going NC. but I do love my dad and don\u2019t want to hurt him. haven\u2019t yet been able to convince myself that him hurting me justifies me hurting him. seems like from this I already have hurt him, somehow? anyways\u2026"

                "body": "**History:**\n\nI (21F) lived with my dad (62M) and my brother (26M) throughout my 4 years of high school. Beforehand, my brother and I were living with our mom (58F), but due to consistent suicide attempts, she returned to the state I was born in for mental support.\n\nLiving with my dad was very difficult. I'm unsure exactly of what (if any) mental disorders he struggles with, but he consistently displayed behaviors of control, neglect, lack of empathy, and a lack of control. Throughout high school he rarely took care of me, so I was forced to learn how to take care of myself-- meals, transportation, chores, etc. On top of that, he placed very high expectations onto me, such as maintaining all A's, keeping up with chores, always participating in something music-related in school (he used to be a band director), and staying on top of chores. If I didn't meet all of his expectations, forgot to do something he asked of me, disagreed with him about anything, expressed feelings he didn't like, or if I did something he didn't like period, he'd punish me. Thankfully it was never physical punishment, but often involved things like yelling, changing the Wifi password, threatening to take away things he was providing for me, and hiding my personal belongings. He once went into my bedroom while I was in school, put all of my belongings into trash bags, and made me buy the bags back.\n\nWhat stuck with me most, though, was the emotional abuse and neglect. I was very unhappy after witnessing some of my mom's suicide attempts (was later diagnosed with PTSD) and thus was very scattered, emotional, and had difficulty adjusting to my dad's rules and way of life when I began high school. Every time I would try to talk to my dad to tell him his expectations were too much on me or he was being too hard on me, he would punish me instead of listening. Unfortunately, specific instances aren't as clear, but I do remember when I was 17, he became aggressive upon noticing I had an 89 in a class. I assured him the grade was incorrectly displayed (which was the truth), but every question I had about why he was angry was met with more anger, accusing me of picking a fight, disobeying his authority, etc. My brother defended me that night (he and my dad were hardly on good terms; my dad tended to favor me) and in retaliation, my dad kicked him out of the apartment, threatening to call the police if I left with him. We fled to my boyfriend's family's place, where they let us stay for a few days. At the time, I insisted on declaring myself an independent minor, but my dad threatened to take away my car and anything else of mine that he could if I did.\n\nLeaving for college and being away from my family was a huge time of healing for me. In my hometown, my dad lived with roommates and mom, who moved back home, was living with my brother. My visits to home were infrequent, but despite that, my dad still tried to maintain control over me--he would call weekly and text/email daily, had my phone on a tracker, and retained access to my finances. Throughout college, the constant contact from him was overwhelming and I was desperate to get away. Of course, his reactions to me slowly distancing myself from him didn't go well:\n\n* When I told him I didn't want to talk weekly anymore, he accused me of being cold, selfish, and bipolar\n* When I tried discussing the affects his neglect/abuse had on me in high school, he suggested that maybe I was the bad daughter instead of him being a bad parent and said I needed to apologize\n* When I turned my tracker off, he (who moved to my college town this year to be closer to me) accused me of punishing him and insisted he'd come by every day to make sure I was okay\n* When my boyfriend (same as the one in high school) and I were fighting, he went behind my back to speak ill of me to him, support him, and even visited him at work to display his support\n* When I created an independent bank account a couple months ago (for independence but also because he was taking money out of my savings to use for himself), he became paranoid of my reasons behind doing so, asking if my mom convinced me to do this (she has relapsed and is currently very mentally unstable, not capable of manipulating anyone)\n\nIn spite of all of this, he has always been insistent about his love for me, and due to the fact that the rest of our family is not a big fan of him, he is pretty clingy and treats me like I'm all he has.\n\n**The present:**\n\nA couple weeks ago, he told me he was looking for a counselor, said he needed to figure out why he was so anxious when it came to me. I was elated-- he was finally acknowledging his issues and was going to work on getting better! He asked if I would talk to his counselor and share my side of the story. The day before, he told me that his intention was actually family counseling and not personal counseling, which broke my heart. Still, I met with his counselor, talked her through my experiences, and she told me she would work with him on some of the issues I mentioned before ever bringing us into a joint session.\n\nA few days ago, he and I started arguing about the sessions. He was angry about me putting conditions on our relationship, saying his love for me should be enough, that he shouldn't have to change himself for me and he isn't interested in working on his flaws. I contacted his counselor to ask about what to do, and she responded telling me she no longer wanted to work with him. She said my dad didn't care about her \"tools\" to help him, insisted on doing things his way in spite of my feelings and her recommendations, and said that doing things his way would only reinforce the idea that my feelings are unimportant and his agenda is what should be prioritized over everything and everyone. She sent a copy of this email to my dad.\n\nHe responded by saying of the 30+ counselors he's had through the years, the best ones have helped him accept who he is and have told him he doesn't need to apologize for himself and not change himself. He said he is only interested in finding a counselor who will help me understand and accept him.\n\nHe then emailed me saying I could either accept him and love him as he is or \"we will both be miserable moving forward.\" He continuously asks me why it's so hard for me to accept him. I have constantly reiterated to him that I can't just accept his flaws when they are abusive and they hurt me, and constantly question why he refuses to take accountability, but he never acknowledges my questions.\n\nAt this point, I have no idea what to do. I love my dad very much and I am sure he loves me. More than anything, all I've ever wanted was a stable parent who I can trust and go to for support and comfort, but with my dad's abuse and my mom's mental instability, it has never been an option. My dad, though, is unwilling to change, and I'm scared he's going to continue to hurt me for the rest of his life. I am sick of the hurt. My boyfriend adores my mom but does not like my dad at all.\n\nI've been seriously considering cutting my dad out of my life completely. But I know that it would be a very big decision. I don't want to hurt him. I don't want to rob him of walking me down the aisle, having a relationship with his grandchildren, having family to lean on if he ever needs the help. But at the same time, there's only so much more of this that I can take.\n\nWhat should I do?"

We left off on confusing terms, where he blocked me in the middle of an argument, leaving me with so many questions. i want to understand what happened, I want to understand why he did so much of what he did, why he blocked me, if he ever really cared... because he really seemed to care about me, but he knew how much he hurt me and let me keep hurting.\n\nafter seeing that he unblocked me on Snapchat yesterday, I've been super tempted to re-add him just to send him a message, to tell him how his silence has made me feel and to ask for an explanation about his side of the story. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? he ignores my message without even reading it? I don't know. I just want to stop thinking about this, and time hasn't been healing all wounds. I just want to move on, but it's so hard when I still have so many questions.\n\nPlease help.\n\n(backstory [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/wf5p2g/he_blocked_me_after_i_stood_up_for_myself/) if anyone is interested)"

Maybe even find some comfort in any similar experiences. \u2639\ufe0f\n\nI was in jail for disorderly conduct for arguing with a police officer. I was parked on a side street trying to decompress from a fight my ex and I had. The cop came up behind my car with a flashlight and generally scared. He asked me what I was doing and I literally said \u201cI\u2019m sitting in my fucking car what does it look like?\u201d Mind you I\u2019m in the Deep South with a thick Boston accent and attitude. I had been drinking (not drunk and not charged with DUI) but also was NOT taking my bipolar 1 meds as prescribed. When I got to the jail I refused to tell them my medical history out of fear and sheer stupidity. I had never been to jail before and was really really scared. I have taken 4mg of alprazolam (Xanax) for my panic disorder for the past 10 years as well. Soooo I was in jail for 6 days with NO meds and withdrawing from alcohol, my psychiatric meds, AND the benzodiazepines I have taken everyday for years. The experience was absolutely frightening. I thought the fluorescent lights were the lights of an ambulance and I was being resuscitated but it wasn\u2019t working and I could hear my family\u2019s voices tell me that it\u2019s okay to die and  \u201cit\u2019s okay Betsy, go to Heaven, go be with Ma (my dead grandmother), you\u2019re gone, you\u2019re dead now, it\u2019s okay to go\u201d\u2026 So when I woke up from that delusion I thought I was in purgatory and the only way to get out was by playing a big game of monopoly\u2026 Where the other female inmates (if there were any as I didn\u2019t know what was real and what wasn\u2019t) would control your movement around the room like a game board\u2026 I know this sounds INSANE. \n\nSo later on I was hearing different frequencies and thought the government was communicating with me and I was a part of their experiment because I could hear them. I thought it was the CO\u2019s messing with me by flashing memes and photos on the fluorescent lights\u2026 I thought they were pinging radio frequencies off the titanium staples in my stomach (from my gastric bypass surgery I had a few years ago\u2026) I heard voices in the walls from EVERYWHERE in the correctional facility. \n\nAt one point it felt like I was fighting two sides of myself, remember how I mentioned I have bipolar disorder\u2026 I was looking in the toilets for clues and crawling around listening to these \u201cvoices\u201d tell me what to do\u2026 There\u2019s really no other way to explain this experience but I literally thought I was dead for days after that.. I kept asking my family if I was alive and if they were real.. My mom told me that she talked to me as much as she could and I asked her why she told me to \u201cdie in there\u201d. My mom never said that. She started crying and told me the jail staff asked if her daughter \u201cwas psychotic.\u201d Apparently I was having full on conversations with the wall that I thought was my mom..\n\nI was hearing and seeing things in the vents in the jail and thought there were faces on the floor that changed with the different shades of fluorescent lights\u2026 I have no idea how I fucking survived this but holy shit\u2026 I was literally pingponging between different dimensions and different frequencies.. I also kept hearing the same two songs on repeat.. Both Tool songs, my favorite band.. For 5 days along with the voices I would hear \u201cSatan, Satan, Satan\u201d and also hear another set of Tool lyrics, \u201cA tempest must be just that. Control, your delusion\u201d OVER AND OVER. \n\nAlso at one point the voices were fighting with each other to have me stay in purgatory.. These were ACTUAL people\u2019s voices that I knew hearing them talk clear as day.. I was on the other side of the country and my family was desperately trying to bail me out. I was finally let out \u201con my own recognizance\u201d. This was 8 months ago and I still wonder if I died in there and am experiencing purgatory right now.\n\nI\u2019m aware that I *should* have immediately told the police AND jail staff that I was on medication and had psychiatric illnesses. I apparently would have been released to a psych facility or home because I was a \u201cliability\u201d to the county jail. But noooooooo. My dumbass was stoic and didn\u2019t tell anyone anything. BIG MISTAKE.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add.. Might it be possible that one of the other inmates slipped me something while I was in there? Something that causes such psychosis? One of my doctors said it sometimes happens but idk. This was my only experience in jail. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"

Initially, I brushed it off, but he ended up staying there for 5 and a half hours, all through lunch time, not getting out his car. When my boyfriend left the flat to go to the corner store, the car immediately drove off, which added suspicion.\n\nI feel we made eye contact a few times, and my boyfriend thinks that the guy flipped him off, but he couldn't make it out from down in the car. It unnerved us quite a bit, considering that the day prior we discovered that our back left car tyre had been stabbed and was flat.\n\nSorry for the rant, I feel like I just had to get this off my chest and was wondering if anyone had any advice/ had noticed any suspicious behaviour around East Street - bartletts Road."

Even if C6 Sucrose can transfer EM and provide a damage buff like C2 Kazuha, thus technically offering more than a C0 Kazuha on paper, Kazuha is a melee unit (unlike Sucrose and Venti) who gathers enemies toward him and staggers them, making it easy for melee DPS to constantly deal damage without having to move from that one spot. He also spends a lot of time in iframes, so on a quickswap team with Kazuha you can just spam E and Q without having to move or dodge.

When I looked into it just now, though, I saw that many people were saying the 50% is additive and gets tacked onto any other DMG bonuses in the damage formula. Other people say that there are no diminishing returns on his C4, implying that it\u2019s a multiplicative increase. I couldn\u2019t find the original source that I\u2019m remembering to check if there was any proof.\n\nDoes anyone know for sure how this 50% increase is calculated and have a source to link to back it up?"

I got my C1 Bennett to C6 on Kazuha's banner and only hesitated for about .5 seconds before deciding to activate the last constellation, and I'm actually loving it. My mains are Venti, Xiao, and Kazuha, so the pyro infusion doesn't ruin any of their playstyles and so far I've only seen benefits.\n\nWith Kazuha, he gives himself a pyro damage bonus just from swirling pyro, and Bennett's field gives an additional 15% pyro damage bonus. Having his auto attacks convert to pyro makes it even easier to swirl pyro and makes them stronger than his physical auto attacks due to the elemental damage bonus.\n\nAs for Xiao: Against an enemy with high physical resistance like a ruin guard, I found that his physical auto attacks usually do less than 1K per hit, but when converted to pyro (without a pyro cup or anything), his normal attacks are around 4-5K and his charged attack is around 9K. I'd say that's a big plus when we're up against enemies with high physical resistance.\n\nI haven't tested Bennett in every situation yet, but I expect the infusion is also useful against cryo or electro shields.\n\nFor those who have C6 Bennett, what do you think? Do you regret activating the last constellation? Are there situations you've encountered where it's actually really helpful?"

I thought I would pose the question to the community to see if anyone has thoughts, insight, or experience to share.\n\nI've been using Xingqiu as a support for Yanfei to proc vaporize. Although I've been grinding the Noblesse domain for months, I have yet to get a single good ATK% sands, so I'm stuck between temporarily using an energy recharge or elemental mastery sands on Xingqiu. He already has over 200% energy recharge without an ER sands, so I decided to try elemental mastery (which has better substats anyway).\n\nThat led me to wonder, though, how much does Xingqiu's elemental mastery really matter? Is he the one proccing vaporize while his burst is up, or is Yanfei? If it's him proccing vaporize, then his elemental mastery should make the hydro damage numbers higher while the pyro damage remains the same as without a reaction, right? I see that Yanfei's damage is much higher when \"Vaporize\" appears, so that leads me to believe that she is the one proccing vaporize, in which case Xingqiu's elemental mastery wouldn't matter, right?\n\nI guess in the end, I need to keep looking for a better ATK% sands, but I'm just wondering whether EM is completely useless on Xingqiu or not. Would love to hear any thoughts.\n\n(P.S. I'm kind of new to Reddit and don't participate in Genshin discourse much, so I apologize if I put the wrong flair on this post.)"

We're human, we don't deserve to be berated for closing a half hour early because we're short staffed. We were both tired, the manager saw I was upset about how the man treated me and I may text my manager (manager of the deli, not a store manager) and let her know what happened and that we both clocked out close to the original times we were supposed to because of this man. 9:15 for my cowoker, and 9:30 for me, I was scheduled until 10, but, I'm always out by 9:30 when I do closing shift.\n\nSeriously, there's no need to throw a tantrum just because you couldn't get your Muenster cheese!"

                "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nJust found this sub recently after rekindling a relationship with my ex of 2 years, who I feel like I may have formed trauma bond with.\n\nShe revealed to me that she did not know she had BPD when we dated (although I came to the conclusion in our time apart) and after realizing her illness, told me that she has done a lot of work on herself to improve. She has shown to be more self aware, and has owned up to the episodes she would go through during our relationship. These episodes included constant feelings of jealousy and inadequacy leading to meltdowns as well as the gaslighting. She appears to be more mature and collected overall.\n\nAs most people on this sub, I truly feel as if this person is a soul mate, and I spent the better part of these past 2 years wishing I could be with her again, so naturally I\u2019m very happy to have her back in my life. I\u2019ve told her things like this and she told me in return that she shared similar feelings.\n\nThe problem arises when I find out she still is in a relationship, and lives with the person on top of this. I can\u2019t help but feel like 1) an ass for facilitating the cheating of someone she is probably in the process of discarding 2) a schmuck knowing that I\u2019m developing feelings for someone that\u2019s probably having regular sex with someone else 3) like I\u2019m just a row boat off of a ship that she\u2019s on.\n\nMy general motto has been to never get in a relationship with a cheater, as it\u2019s most likely to happen again. But as I\u2019m sure many of you can relate with, I\u2019ve never felt so intensely for someone.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Should I cut this off before I develop those feelings for her again? Am I walking directly into a trap? Is it really true that people with BPD can never actually change their emotional patterns??\n\nI know it is common for people in this situation to fantasize and idealize our BPD loved ones heavily, but I almost feel I would regret not seeing it through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: A big heartfelt thank you to everyone who took the time to read and reply. You have all helped me shift my perspective as the what is really going on and it means a lot. A lot of your responses are undoubtedly hard pills to swallow but if I don't want to end up in the emotional wreck I was in, and undo all the time I spent rebuilding, some deep reconsideration clearly needs to happen. \n\nI'd also like to say what a relief it has been to find this sub and see that there are others who have gone through such bizarrely similar relationships as I went through with this person.

                "body": "I wanted to give some of the guys out there struggling some motivation, so here is my story with addiction.\n\n\n\n***FACING THE ADDICTION***\n\n\n I am 20 years old, almost 21. I have played video games nearly all my life, and have spent thousands of hours in wow, Source games and League. \n\n\nUntil recently, I never bothered with dealing with this addiction because video games offered me such an easy escape. It was SO EASY to procrastinate with my responsibilities when my League client was already open and waiting for me to hit play. \n\nHowever, with college and other pressing responsibilities, I couldn't help but feel wrong with my gaming habits. I read a lot of threads on this subreddit talking about how people don't find video games enjoyable anymore, but continue to play them.\n\nThis is exactly what was happening to me, and I promise you this is the first step in conquering your bad habit. \n\nThe game that broke the camel's back for me was Black Desert Online. Within a week I found myself playing the game 8 hours a day, but I dreaded every second of it. It was painful, but every day I kept opening the game and playing for hours and hours. \n\nIt got so bad that I started to really question what the hell I was doing with my time - and one day I was so fed up with myself I went looking for help online. \n\nI found this subreddit, and thought that I should give a go at quitting altogether.\n\n***QUITTING***\n\nI am not going to bullshit you and tell you that quitting video games is a magic pill to a happier life, because that is not what it is.\n\nRather, if it did for you what it did for me, quitting video games will bring to the surface problems that you have hid away for years because you used gaming as a shield. \n\nIf you are able to face these problems head on, and deal with them one step at a time, then you will reap the benefits of quitting. *Quitting alone will not solve your problems*!\n\nFor example, one of the biggest things that surfaced for me when I quit gaming was how LAZY I was. Video games were the perfect way to waste time, and once I threw that out of the equation, my mind wanted to search for other ways to avoid my responsibilities. \n\nThese are problems that I had to deal with *on my own* because quitting games alone did not solve that. However, it was a step in the right direction because they were absolutely in the way of dealing with said problems.\n\n***THE BENEFITS***\n\n* I no longer find pleasure in gaming. I think this was when I understood I had kicked the addiction. Because gaming was such an easy way for me to waste countless hours, this one was the most important for me. Naturally I have started picking up old hobbies and having a new found joy in them. Now, I cannot play video games without feeling as if I could be doing something much more productive.\n\n*  I take more pleasure in social interactions. Time with friends and family seem much more enjoyable to me now, because I'm not thinking about how I could be home playing games. This was such a big issue for me that has been lifted completely off my shoulders.\n*  I'm taking bigger steps in dealing with much more significant personal matters (fitness, confidence, anxiety, other addictions... etc.)\n*  I DON'T FEEL ASHAMED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I DO AT HOME WITH MY FREE TIME!!!\n\n\n***MY TIPS TO YOU*** \n\n* Don't make quitting gaming about quitting gaming, make it about improving yourself, because if you do not have a goal to fight for you will become complacent and relapse.\n* In the early stages, don't let yourself get bored. Don't ever stop working towards your goal of being the best you you can be.\n* If you are afriad to quit, but you are in a similar situation to mine (don't enjoy gaming anymore) you may be surprised how easy it is to drop the habit. Take the first step and the rest will follow.\n\nTo all you guys out there who have had the courage to look at themselves, acknowledge they have a problem, and want to DEAL with it, I promise it is 100% achievable.

                "body": "My friend and I were talking over the idea of mounted combat, and I pointed out that there\u2019s nothing strictly in the rules that prevents humanoids from being mounts, as long as their rider were a size smaller.\n\nSo we started coming up with a character combo that utilized a small character and a large character.\n\nWhat we arrived at was a Kobold Cavalier with Mounted Combatant and a Metallic Dragonborn Bladesinger as the mount. Originally we were thinking the mount would be a barbarian for heft or a monk for mobility, but when we thought about it, the redirect from mounted combatant opened up the possibility for the mount to be a spellcaster and stay relatively safe, as long as they had high enough constitution to survive an AOE hit. I also went with a gold dragonborn to resist any fireballs, and took absorb elements for some other AOE coverage. You definitely consider taking resilient dex here for the evasion cheese, or a paladin as the rider for aura of protection.\n\nHaving a mount that can cast spells is pretty cool, and having the fighter on your back really changes up how you choose your spells (some usual picks become redundant, and some obscure picks become useful). I also considered a draconic sorcerer to stay beefy but be able to twin buffs, but I could think of many instances where we\u2019d both need the same buff, so we went without.\n\nDue to initiative discrepancies, the rider wielding a crossbow would likely be the best choice, having both melee and range available. We\u2019re aware that the cavalier fighter scales on strength, but you don\u2019t have to use a fighter for this necessarily. A paladin, ranger or different subclass of fighter could all make for good riders. Maybe even a barbarian, depending on how you wanted to do it. \n\nThe more obvious version of this build would probably involve a moon druid instead (I like dhampir for this due to spider climb on all wild shapes), but that wouldn\u2019t really he a chicken fighter, now would it?\n\nJust wanted to share an unusual theorycraft. Is it the strongest thing in the world? Absolutely not. Is it funny? Of course. I\u2019d love to hear how you all would build a PC mount combo like this."

All sorts of strange individuals are in town at the moment, the following being those wishing to compete:\n\n1. Shelly Turkins: A 9 year old tortle girl with a yellow bow on her shell and matching yellow tap shoes. She wants to do an elaborate tap dance routine during the competition that she\u2019s very proud of, though offstage she\u2019s very shy and closed off. \n\n2. Jensis Meikals. A greyish pink tiefling in his mid 50s who plans to act out a one man play detailing an obscure political event from two centuries ago. It might be satirical?\n\n3. Susan the Silent, Githzerai mime. One of the most famous mimes to ever live, an absolute master of the craft and of bodily control. Some speculate she might use psionics or illusions to help imitate scenery around her, but she has large enough a fanbase for these claims to go unresolved.\n\n4. Jones Haunto. An eccentric archaeologist and paleontologist, said to be acquainted with bardic magics. Plans to do a routine about animating fossils like puppets. Whether this is necromancy or mere telekinesis remains unknown, but regardless powerful magic is undoubtedly involved. A very unpopular contestant due to his frivolous and insensitive use of priceless artifacts and human bones.\n\n5. Braduro, Giant Magician. A massive fire giant who, of all things, has brought forward a magic act. More specifically, magic tricks using sleight of hand. It\u2019s very unlikely this hulking giant knows any actual magic, though people are nevertheless astonished at how a giant so large is able to pull off optical illusions with props larger than some of the audience members.\n\n6. Zigzeen Hibbins, Lizardfolk Bard. This Lizardfolk is one of the most gifted instrumentalists to ever live from a technical standpoint, but it\u2019s clear as day this individual lacks any emotional connection to the music. The story about him is he once saw a bard make a guy\u2019s head explode, and decided that day to study bard magic for its power. Nowadays he\u2019s a very successful musician and moderately successful mage.\n\n7. Stivan Steelbird, Gnome Illusionist. Apparently this gnome wizard has managed to create a massive moving illusory screen that lasts 2 and a half hours long and depicts an elaborate story with characters and music. He calls it a \u201cmotion picture.\u201d People usually brush him off as crazy.\n\n8. Ch\u00e9 Atkins. Known conartist who tries to sway the judges with Hypnotic Paterns and Suggestion Magic, his magic is not powerful enough to also affect the audience watching the show. u/Blamush\n\n9. Thelixpea, Storm Sorcerer with Siren ancestory. Her song is the most beautiful thing any man in the audience and jury has ever heard, women are far less impressed. u/Blamush\n\n10. Yasuho Honoka : this 7-year old Ghostwise Halflin monk is impressive. Able to highkick a Goliath in the face, she demonstrate a martial art routine using a dagger attach to a 5 feet rope in order to reach human-head level target with an incredible precision. u/Viclaterreur\n\n11. Beat Drop, a Kenku who makes elaborate dance tunes via mixes of sounds she's sampled a la Stomp. u/indiwyn\n\n12. The Amazing Sprinkle, a Water Genasi who can make water do tricks in the air, and also jump from glass to glass until he ruins everyone's drinks and gets escorted out. u/indiwyn\n\n13. A group of untalented spellcasters who dropped out of the Academy to form the Mage Hand Puppet Players. u/indiwyn\n\n14. Terry the terrasque, a terraque who thinks he can dance. Whether he can or not it up to your definition of dance. u/Geekwithahat\n\n15. Rakrial the rapping red dragon: brings on a huge wagon as a portion of his horde, proceeds to freestyle rap a list of every item in the wagon from memory in under 5 minutes, finishing with the reveal that many of your items are part of his horde, as his kobolds have gone around pickpocketing the audience. u/geekwithahat\n\n16. The Burlesque Basilisk show. [insert rock hard joke here]. u/geekwithahat\n\n17. The Weavels. For human bards with bowl haircuts that have gained a massive following in the short amount of time they've been performing together.\n\n18. Kristoff Cornelius. A human bard that normally performs in a popular troupe called The Garden of Sound, but is quite good performing by himself. He'll be competing by performing a classic, \"Nothing Compares to You\", a song that's so popular that even the Prince has been heard singing it.\n(A side note, you can easily play the song that I'm referring to in the background while describing this performer playing.) u/nabeshein\n\n19. Bleepin Loopfoodle: A retired gnome illusionist who spends his days theorizing with scholars at the Capital Academy of Magical Arts. His performance is a lesson in the very basics of magic and cantrip casting, but done entirely through rhyme, illusion, and a simple dance. The fascinating visuals and catchy chorus turns the crowd into a students that can't stop paying attention! Some say after seeing the performance a few times, you can even figure out a cantrip yourself! u/soshp\n\n20. Baya Taerth, a drider sorcerer, who using her innate abilities and her magic, performs a masterful high wire and acrobatics act, with her own special effects and musical accompaniment. u/AlexaireMithras\n\n21. Joe buckwheat: a backwoods cleric who can \u201cswallow swords\u201d .... as long as they\u2019re spiritual weapon u/sbrevolution5\n\n22. The Amazing Krognaks\u2019: Shat, Gnurl, Xarlug, Lazgar, Maxoga, Badbog, and Uloth \u2013 The Amazing Krognaks\u2019, a family of Orc (four male, three female) known for their amazing acts in acrobatics, trained animals, trapeze acts, hooping, tightrope walking, juggling, contortion, trampoline acts, uni-cycling and other stunt-oriented artists. Their most amazing act combines juggling, animal acts, and magic. They juggle abyssal chickens, badgers, and boggles with amazing skills. At the end, they make all the animals disappear. No one can figure out how. Of course, it\u2019s because they eat them. u/ThreeandTwentyChars\n\n23. Harold Underhill: a sharply-dressed, fast-talking bard who specializes in enchantment-style magic. He can't actually play any instruments himself; his act is picking out random audience members and charming them into believing they're musicians. u/WhiskeyPixie24\n\n24. Mimic as just the ventriloquist dummy alone, still talking though. Gets violent when he is finally removed from the stage. u/esuma10\n\n25. 3 confused but happy-to-be-there Flumphs. u/roostercrowe\n\n26. Durg Rok - a half orc warlock with a great old one patron, and the actor feat - does comedic performances with the aid of illusion magic, a bit shameless at times and not afraid to insult or make fun of himself or take a hit to get a laugh (physical comedy I guess). Also enjoys rhymes / raps and can sing (though he thinks he is better than he actually is). u/chewy52\n\n27. Clawdia - an awakened giant crab that specializes in dancing, a unique combination of tap dancing and break dancing with her legs and claws. u/chewy52\n\n28. Florin Radu: A vampire who has trained himself to withstand both searing sunlight and running water. He can be out in the sun for hours on end and survive rushing rapids with only minor discomfort. u/quantext609\n\n29. Zzckgrck: An eldritch god who has the power to twist minds and warp flesh to its whim, but has decided to entertain itself with this talent show. Its talent? Juggling. u/quantext609\n\n30. Paula Blackhammer: A female dwarf with a strong singing voice. But due to how dwarf vocal chords function, it ends up resembling a male opera singer more than anything feminine. u/quantext609\n\n31. Uminoch: Just a regular aboleth who comes there to mind control the competition and ruin the show. u/quantext609\n\n32. Arstin Corduro, whose act is almost exactly the same as the previous performer's, but obviously not as well performed. u/Fluffy5789\n\n33. Wanda Castamere: A Wild Magic Sorcerer. You're not sure what she's going for, but it's certainly not what's happening. u/LaserBeams2\n\n34. Burk Bentbean: Human Male, 56. Claims that his talent is mind-reading. He demands that the judges look him in the eyes at all times, so that he can prove his clairvoyance through reading their thoughts. He does not. u/atomicDaikaiju"

He appeared to have had more control than the symbiote did. And that symbiote was old and on it's death bed. From what we saw of Lord Yu, an old symbiote is more susceptible to being influenced and doesn't do well with controlling it's memories and host.\n\nIf the rest of the hosts had shared 50% of control, then I'm sure we would've seen more Tokra leaving their organisation or trying to press agendas to support their own home planets and see loved ones.

And treating the Genii like they're potential allies is completely foolish as we see throughout the series when the Genii continuously attack the Tauri and cause them trouble costing more lives.\n\nI get that Genii military targets are hidden and are often blended in with civilian populations. So blowing things up from a distance is out of the question. But perhaps beaming some of their a-bombs out of their bunkers wouldn't be such a bad idea. Or perhaps work on getting informants in the Genii to reveal some hidden outposts. Simply catching a prisoner or two would help a lot.\n\nBasically the Tauri should've been doing what they could to ensure the Genii didn't pose a serious threat and they should've tried to gain information on the Genii and treat them like the enemy they were.

And that upsets me even more.\n\nI've never felt this way and it's tough. I might get over it after a sleep, but I feel like I shouldn't let this one pass. She really said something that I shouldn't forgive easily."

                "body": "Right so this is just what's going on in my head right now and I feel like I need to write it down and let others hear it for some reason. Feelings are weird. Might not make sense, but if it does then help is appreciated.\n\nI'm going through a shit time right now and I feel like I should be crying, but I'm not. I've put some sad music on, I've tried to cry. I've thought about what's making me upset. I just can't seem to break out the tears. I feel like I need to cry to get past this thing that's been bothering me. I just want to put it behind me and move on, but I can't seem to do it.\n\nCome to think of it, I don't think I've cried since before COVID. wtf is with that?\n\nI know what I've got to do to sort it all out, but it's so hard. I can't focus on anything, and I have a habit of forgetting my goals and shit. No number of post-it notes around my house can save me from forgetting when I get into my car to go to work. And without those goals I end up just procrastinating. Of course I end up procrastinating, why would I want to deal with all of the bullshit this world has to offer if I have no reason to? I'll just be doing shit for the sake of doing shit. And the level of bullshittery out there is incredible, it really grinds me head in. Why would I want to put myself through that for no real reason? So I need to try to get a goal and keep it in my head. Even the small shit.\n\nI guess I need to make a plan about the little shit that needs doing and somehow remember that it exists and then hope that I actually do it. But then what about external factors? What do I prioritise? The shit that needs doing or my physical health. My physical health is already a shit show anyway, but I still need sleep and hygiene and rest to function. I don't have that much time in the day after work. Perhaps I could incorporate some of my to do list into work? But how tf would that even work?\n\nBefore all of this, what do I even want? If I'm gonna make a plan, I've got to think about what I want right? I don't want anything. So where do I even start? What do I like? Do I start with that? But the things I like, I'll only like for a little while before I get bored of them so what's the point? I'll just go all-out trying to accomplish something that I'll dump after a couple of months. Even then everything I like seems to be complicated shit and in order to do complicated shit in life, first I've got to go through the boring shit. There's nooo way I'm going to be able to do that. School was boring enough of a grind for me. No way am I going to go back to doing something so repetetive and tedious as that. School was fun for the social aspect, but studying was the worst. Even the subjects I liked, they somehow managed to make them boring. \"Here's the formulae to this question, now apply the same formulae to these 2000 questions in exactly the same way.\" fuck off is that teaching. First 5 questions I understand the formulae. Why do I need to do the exact same fucking thing for 3 months? I got it already ffs. I've been in jobs like that, I don't want to suffer through that bullshit again. There's no way I'll survive one of those jobs long enough to get to the actually interesting stuff.\n\nAh crap I've been sat here for the past hour thinking and typing but I still haven't actually solved anything. Still haven't cried and I've broke into my bed time so now I'm gonna be fucking tired when I get to work again. Again hahaha. I don't know why I'm this annoyed about me doing this when I've been tired for the past 20 years of my goddamn life. Even if I go to bed it's not like I'm going to be able to sleep. I fell asleep in my dinner the other day. I woke up super tired so I cleaned my face and went straight to bed. The second I got into bed I felt wide awake. Like ALWAYS. Proceeded to spend the next 3 hours tossing and turning in bed feeling uncomfortable af and thinking about stupid shit like quantum wave functions. I don't know shit about quantum wave functions yet I spent 3 hours thinking about it? Why? I just wanted to fucking sleep.\n\nWell whatever. I'm gonna have a smoke and then listen to some sad music in hopes that it gets me to sleep.\n\nNah I'm not. That's what I want to do, but the reality is I'm gonna fucking sit here and listen to music for another hour thinking about this same nonsense I've typed down. Then when I'm so tired that I can't keep my eyes open I'll climb into bed and not sleep for another 2 hours. Fuck this shit I'm wasting my time."

While that doesn't sound too bad in fact at heart it's rather harmless, but it can mean that members of the government don't have our best interests at heart when making decisions that effect the whole country and other countries around the world. (This is obviously just a simple take on a more complex situation with many nuances)\n\nI personally take the stance of banning them from it altogether and I don't really care if it does contradict my association with the libertarian ideology since there are various other things I believe in that do.

Nonetheless, he states that anyone can perceive these differences that he is describing.\n\nSo he continues to describe them not as biological concepts but as abstract psychological concepts.\n\nPart of the concept is the when a function becomes dominant it begins to represent conscious aims. In any choice or decision, according to Jung, there are 4 psychological processes which can influence decisions making. These influences can be rational or irrationally based.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060is this decision validated by ideas, concepts, theories\n\n\u2022\t\u2060is this decision a good, desirable, or valuable decision\n\n\u2022\t\u2060was the decision compelled by the stimulation of the senses or\n\n\u2022\t\u2060was it compelled by the inspiration or imagination of intuition\n\nWhat we perceive as personality, is when a person consciously and habitually chooses one of these functions as the deciding factor. As to why one of the functions gets chosen more than an other is exactly what personality is all about. It cannot be described as anything else other than a persons innate predisposition to do so.\n\nSo what happens when a person consciously chooses to make their choices based on sentimental or value based judgement? When this happens, it means that although the other influences are there in the person, they are repeatedly rejected and ignored especially if they contradict the feeling judgement.\n\nAccording to Jung, the function that can most contradict a feeling judgement is a thinking judgment.\n\nFor example, someone could determine that it is good to pursue a religious faith despite there being a lack of evidence of a higher being. When things are normal, these intellectual judgements are kept at bay and are viewed as unnecessary in such a pursuit.\n\nHowever, in moments of significant distress, these intellectual judgements that have been repressed arise as harsh criticisms, and suspicions of their beliefs. Again, the influence has an out of character, destructive and negative impact on the person, who is suddenly aware and maybe even disturbed by the fact that these judgements had existed within themselves all this time.\n\nThis would be characteristic of an unconscious function.",

Your behaviors seem out of character to you and onto others. According to Jung, the influence of the unconscious makes itself present when it has been ignored for too long and therefore tends to have a negative influence on your decisions making.

To answer some common Qs first:\n\nQ) It doesn't say required.\nA) it does in the original email and we were told verbally it's required, unpaid, and on our own time. We must track hours and submit them to HR. There is no specified consequence for failure to comply. I guess they assume we will all fall in line.\n\nQ) companies can require volunteer work from salaried people. \nA) not unpaid and on our own time, per the NLRB and Cabinet of Labor. It's not part of our regular duties nor would it be expected of anyone based on our industry and skills. \n\nQ) what company? Where are you?\nA) telling you that would doxx myself. I'm in Kentucky in the USA.\n\nQ) have you talked to a lawyer?\nA) I contacted the NLRB, who said it wasn't really something they handle unless I am fired and then I can bring a case of wrongful termination. But they agreed it is illegal. I contacted the Department of Wage and Hours and they claimed it's allowed because it's a \"condition of employment.\" I called the Kentucky Cabinet of Labor and they said it IS illegal to require volunteer hours even from salaried managers. I have also asked 3 labor lawyers for consultations.\n\nQ) forwards everything and prepare for termination.\nA) done and done!\n\nQ) why 75 hours? Why 7500 hours?\nA) the goal is to \"celebrate\" the 75th anniversary of the company's founding. We have over 500 employees but not nearly that many managers. So the company wants to make a PR release about their staff \"giving back to the community.\"\n\nQ) are you fired?\nA) not yet! I also told my coworkers what I had done and showed them my sources and resources, and reminded then that they can raise their own concerns if they feel comfortable doing so. So if I am fired, no matter what spin the company puts on it, they'll know the truth and they'll have their own info about their rights as workers.\n\nNow for the update: I met with the head of HR this morning. I recorded the meeting (KY is a one-party consent state) and transcribed it. \n\nIn summary, the head of HR (let's call them J) had 3 takeaways for me. First, that I was correct in that they cannot require volunteer hours from hourly associates, but they are \"looking into\" requiring it of salaried managers. I offered them the phone number to the Kentucky Department of Labor person to whom I spoke, who said she'd be happy to discuss it with our HR team. They snipped, \"I don't need to call her. We have our own legal team. Which is what we're working with.\"\n\nSecond, that the intent behind this requirement is a \"celebration\" of all the things the founder did to give back to the community. To quote, \"he has, in his legacy, how he always gave back to (city), he always wanted to partner with local business.\" I replied, \"requiring two weeks of unpaid labor from your managers doesn't feel like it's celebrating anything but slave labor, honestly... when you make it a requirement, it's not volunteering, it's voluntolding. And it just kinda feels dirty to me to do that.\" To which they said that the first question from associates is always if managers are doing it, if they themselves are, if the CEO is... etc.\n\nThird, J wants me to come to them directly with any concerns verbally so we can talk about it because they said my email sounded \"frustrated and angry.\" They want me to \"hear our side\" and they didn't respond via email because \"I wanna talk to (OP), I wanna, like, understand each other rather than kinda going back on email and putting our own interpretation into the words.\"\n\nIt was a ten minute conversation. The HR leader is looking into the matter. I followed up with a brief email (BCC'ed to myself):\n\n\"Thank you for the discussion today. I look forward to hearing back from you once you have looked into the legality of requiring salaried managers to complete unpaid volunteer hours in the community outside of normal working hours. I understand the intent of (company) was to encourage volunteerism and community spirit and to give back to the community. My coworkers and I, however, find the requirement of volunteering to be absurd as the spirit of volunteering is rooted in the VOLUNTEER aspect. Forced or coerced volunteerism is a punishment and a chore, not a celebration. I appreciate your candor today and look forward to your findings.\"\n\nI included the part about not being the only one annoyed about this requirement as I have spoken to several coworkers and am bringing this complaint on all our behalves, which is a protected labor right per the NLRB agent I spoke to. This makes clear that I bring this complaint in sincerity and gives me certain legal protections.\n\nNext up: HR's findings. Might still be fired who knows.\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n\n[**Update: 75 Hours of Unpaid Community Service.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/vsbe3l/update_75_hours_of_unpaid_community_service/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) - Jul 06, 2022  \n\n\nNew Q&A\nQ) just do it! At least a few hours. \nA) fuck no. My time is MY TIME. Most of us already work 50-70 hours if salaried. \n\nQ) you fired yet?\nA) nope! In fact I got called \"indispensable\" today. Ahahahaha.\n\nQ) who/what company?\nA) no doxxing please. If you guess it, yay, gold star! And shut yer gob.\n\nQ) lie about your hours\nA) the whole idea is they DO NOT get a free PR blitz off of me and my coworkers, liars or not we may be.\n\nQ) what do you do?\nA) IT stuff. Also sow dissent and improve knowledge of labor laws among coworkers. \n\nQ) apply for a new job!\nA) already working on it. Spruced up my resume and everything.\n\nQ) you're going to get termed/you put a target on your back/this was a bad idea\nA) this is definitely the most confrontational I've gotten but I'm legally in the right. And I'm looking for a new job as I've peaked here anyway. Oh and I can afford to stand up for myself and my coworkers\n\nUpdate:\nNothing from HR and now the head of HR is out of office with unspecified return date. My bosses have not heard anything from them. I also requested a copy of my employee file (as I'm writing my performance review) and they said \"there's nothing in there\" but they'd \"double check.\" \n\nOne lawyer of three returned my call. They said to talk to KY Cab of Labor because it's free versus paying them a retainer fee. The other two ghosted me.\n\nMy assigned investigator at KY Cab of Labor has not called me back. I left them a message today. I sent the report on 6/21 so I'm hoping to hear back from them soon...\n\nOtherwise, I have continued to work, let my coworkers know that this is an illegal requirement, and generally encouraged professionally attired dissatisfaction.\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n\n[**Update 4: Work Requiring 75 Hours of Community Service. KY Cab of Labor returned my call. HR is not responding.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/vywohx/update_4_work_requiring_75_hours_of_community/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) - Jul 14, 2022   \n\nFirst, Q&A:\n\nQ) Fired yet? A) Nope. Still chugging along. \n\nQ) There's a target on your back now/You shouldn't have spoken up/you're going to be fired. A) I'm in a uniquely stable position because if I go, \\~1000 daily, weekly, and monthly automated reports, emails, and checks/balances don't happen. I also am the only one knowledgeable in half our systems, including the ones that actually generate our revenue. Finally, I'm the go-to person for solving issues and finding shortcuts/automations in our various platforms and integrations. So my position is pretty secure. Even if it wasn't, my skill set is in high demand and I am already looking for a new job anyway. \n\nQ) Why 75 hours? A) The company wants 75 hours from each manager and a total of 7500 across the company's various LLCs to \"celebrate\" the 75th anniversary of its founding. \n\nQ) You said it applies to managers and that you aren't a manager, so why are you making a fuss? A) Because I have the ability, knowledge, and stubbornness to stand up for my coworkers who don't know it's illegal to require them to complete voluntary work, even outside the company. Also, because the company needs a shake up.\n\nQ) What company? A) I'm trying NOT to doxx myself, so I won't say. And if you guess it, which some have, please keep it to yourself. \n\nQ) What happened with the lawyers? A) I contacted 3 lawyers. One ghosted me, one called me back and suggested I go to to DOL or DWH, and one just sent an email declining to take my case. \n\nQ) Keep everything documented! A) I have been and am continuing to do so. I have all relevant emails on a personal server. \n\nNext, update time!\n\nSince last I posted, there's been three major updates. \n\nFirst, HR has not responded to my follow-up email. They have not spoken to my boss or his boss. They were on PTO and have been back for a few days, but have not contacted me for a meeting. I WFH 3 days a week and refuse to have face-to-face meetings unless it's absolutely vital (hint: it never is; I work in software, not hardware). \n\nSecond, the KY Cab of Labor investigation agent got back to me. She said that the requirement *is* illegal, but they cannot step in until I actually submit the hours and they refuse to pay me for them. Here's the cinch: I'm salary, not hourly. So are the managers they're requiring these 75 hours from. So how are we supposed to be paid for hours of community service when we aren't paid for hours done at work by the hour? However, I have the information and official law and her promise that I can submit a report if they try to take PTO hours or otherwise force me to work without compensation. I can also spread that information to the managers who might be trying to meet this quota outside of and in addition to their usual hours. \n\nThird, I spoke to a C-suite executive and relayed what the KY Cab of Labor told me, that while they can't do anything pre-emptively, they can and will come after the company if I can find and submit proof of managers completing these hours outside of their usual schedules and in addition to their regular workload. And this executive knows I can and will do so. Most managers run 60-80 hour weeks, and have no time for this shit. I know of at least a couple that have flatly refused to do this community service work, and they're high-up managers (not quite executive but close). He claims he'll bring it to leadership - he *is* leadership, but I digress - and I hope it unleashes a shit storm, a back-tracking email, and more delineation between My Time and Work Time.\n\nNow, having given this some thought, I decided that I'd like an excuse to get out of the office on the two days I'm required to be on site. Enter Malicious Compliance. I'll do your 75 hours, O Community-Minded Company with Only the Best Intentions(TM). I've reached out to our local women's health center that offers abortions and offered to volunteer as a clinic escort during business hours. Kentucky has a total ban on abortions - including in cases of rape or incest, thus only \"allowing\" them to save the life of the mother - that is currently being contested in court. For now, the ban has been blocked as Planned Parenthood and the state fight over wording, so this clinic is open and always has protesters with nothing better to do hanging around, hence the need for escorts. \n\nOnce I get going on volunteering as a clinic escort, I will carefully and completely mark all hours thus volunteered and turn in the form to HR each week, so it can be tallied. I will then be entered into their ridiculous contest for monthly prizes for volunteers (dinner for 2 at our own restaurant, admittedly a decent place to eat; or an overnight stay at our own hotel; or $75 in swag bucks, not real money). \n\nWithout knowing how many managers and associates have been swindled into completing these hours, I can't say how big a blip on the radar these hours will be, but I can hope they at least bring some comfort to the escorted folks visiting the clinic. \n\nAm I petty? Sure. \n\nDo I care? Nope.\n\nEdit: the clinic escorts are fully \"staffed\" so I will have to find somewhere else to volunteer, which certainly isn't hard!\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n\n[**Update 5: Work requiring 75 hours of community service. HR got back to me!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/vzsl50/update_5_work_requiring_75_hours_of_community/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) - Jul 15, 2022   \n\nThe head of HR got back to me today! They called me and I was unable to record the conversation, but I took notes as we spoke (for 2 minutes) and wrote down a couple quotations. I hate being called, it spikes my anxiety, but of course HR refuses to do anything written... \n\nThe gist of the conversation boiled down to a gaslighting attempt. They stated that the program was \"not violated any policies\" and they \"don't want to cause an inconvenience to anyone\" and that it would \"continue as structured.\" They said they wanted to \"emphasize to you and to anyone who feels a certain way about it, if they wish not to participate\u2026they do not have to participate.\" As if their line-level employees are going to complain and risk being fired or reprimanded... And many of them don't speak English and are very unaware of their rights anyway. \n\nWhen I asked if they would be revoking the requirement that was written in for managers in the first email to go out, they said they would continue the send the emails as structured. That means they don't plan to revoke the requirement line from the first email in writing, which means that some managers may still consider it a requirement if they don't get the verbal memo from me or HR. \n\nI immediately sent a message to my boss's boss with a summary of the conversation and pointed out that the issue here isn't *policies*, it's *law,* and that not revoking the requirement in writing and making it absolutely clear to all employees that this program is VOLUNTARY means they're heading for violation fines in addition to unpaid wage claims. I also pointed out that the law protects employees from *coercion* as well; that is, if any managers on behalf of the company coerce their employees by cutting hours, giving poor performance reviews, etc, they could also be fined. \n\nI then told him about some of the ways the company could do this thing they want to do *properly* and *lawfully*. I sent a few blog posts from HR sites about how to set up a good volunteer program, all of which emphasized that volunteering benefits employers and employees with productivity increases. \n\nAs for me, I signed up to volunteer *during business hours* with my local animal shelter. They need the help and my company gets to claim the donated time on their PR stunt with my blessing.\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n\n[**Update 6: work requiring 75 hours of community service. HR called in legal and sat me down for a talk.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/w1z57h/update_6_work_requiring_75_hours_of_community/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) - Jul 18, 2022   \n\nSee profile for previous posts. Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile.\n\nAfter our conversation Friday morning, I sent a summary of the convo and my understanding of it to HR and my head boss. That afternoon, Head of HR called me Friday and asked to see me in person. I agreed to come in on Monday as I was WFH on Friday.\n\nI came in at the appointed time and HR said the legal counsel of the company would be joining us as well. They said in no uncertain terms that the memo regarding the volunteer hours would not be changed. The Head of HR also seemed peeved and really does not \"want to circle back on this.\" They emphasized that HR directly reports to our CEO, not to me. Legal also said that they and the outside lawyer had taken a look at the wording and that having \"required\" was not illegal, but acknowledged that if they punished a manager for not doing the hours, THEN it would be illegal. So they won't force anyone to do the volunteering supposedly, just leave it as a written requirement on record. \n\nTechnically they are correct. And I have 0 hope that a manager will come forward with hours volunteered and claim wage theft. So the DOL can't do shit.\n\nSo this seems to be the end of this saga. HR and legal have a written requirement but won't enforce it so it stays just on this side of legal. Managers who take the written word as it is will be out a paycheck's worth of labor. Performance reviews will probably not mention this in writing but I'm sure managers will manager to dock employees who don't do these hours by claiming they're not \"team players\" or some shit.\n\nLegal also made a comment that my boss's boss \"really likes (you)\" and thinks I'm \"very good.\" This made me think the idea of getting rid of me did come up and was shot down. My big boss knows how many systems and automation fail if I leave.\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n\n[**(Mini) Update 7: work requires 75 hours of community service.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/w4lu20/mini_update_7_work_requires_75_hours_of_community/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) - Jul 21, 2022   \n\nOkay, see my profile for the previous posts.\n\nI just need to tell y'all that the Head of HR I was speaking to...\n\nGOT PROMOTED TO DIRECTOR\n\n\ud83e\udd23\n\nAnswers to common questions:\n\nI am job hunting already.\nI am comfortable having a target on my back.\n\nAlso, y'all assume I'm a male.

It's pretty amazing to think that an author made up a name (not necessarily tbh, he could've heard it somewhere else but he simply was the first one to write it down) and now kids can be named like that, I hope it's true ('cus it's funny) but I can't find any reliable sources.\nhttps://www.behindthename.com/name/lucinda\n\nIt is also telling that the Lucindas mentioned in Wikipedia are women who were born in the 20th century. Maybe it became popular only recently, but it makes you wonder what it would have felt like naming your kid after a woman in a book in 1610, similarly to naming your daughter Hermione in the 90s LOL (although Rowling surely didn't make up that name)\n\nI might try asking on askHistorians because Google doesn't say as much as I would've liked..."

Unfortunately you can only do so much, if the place is eating you alive you gotta transfer or quit at some point. Its not a *you* failing, they failed to keep you.\n\nIf you dont feel like you can keep up a positive attitude, thats a-ok. You got a lot going on and youre your own person. Being able to keep up a customer service persona mask is 90% of the trick here. Be honest with your coworkers if you feel worried youre gonna ruin the vibe with low positivity- letting them know whats up with you is a great way to let em know you genuinely want to work on good terms with everyone.\n\nLatch onto the things you can genuinely take pride in, for me it was the drinks. Taking pride in cleanliness, drink construction.. whatever you feel proud about, make it your art. Beyond that, dont let them take advantage of you. If they always put you on bar, dont give 100% every day unless you want to hurt yourself. Give 50% on bar, 70% on register, whatever. Tell someone if youre crashing and need to switch off to take dishes for a while, because lord knows they arent gonna pay attention to your needs if they already drowning.\n\nIf they call you in on a day off, dont do it. The more you give, the more it encourages management to never hire extras. Dont go to optional meetings, accept freebees but dont buy into any company propaganda. If youre in the position to take home free food I more than encourage it, long as there are no narks present.\n\nAt the end of the day, its just a shit job. If you feel like youre drowning but need to stay for school, put as little effort as you can into working (dont sweat, rush, or go above and beyond). Youre here for a paycheck, do whatever it takes to mentally get through the day",

                "body": "Naja in Tschechien sind Alkohol, Zigaretten und andere Drogen deutlich g\u00fcnstiger, und auch nur 3h mitm Auto zur Grenze (von wo ich aufgewachsen bin), also ein attraktives Ziel f\u00fcr junge Erwachsene um mal ein Wochenende einen Drauf zu machen. Und nat\u00fcrlich B\u00f6llern das ganze Jahr.\n\nDer bayrische Wald geht ja in Tschechien weiter, ein beliebtes Ausflugsziel grade f\u00fcr Familien, da liegt es nahe mal \u00fcber die Grenze zu fahren.\n\nGenerell ist Tschechien ein interessantes Land f\u00fcr Urlaub wenn man nicht auf Strand aus ist.\n\nViele Leute fahren auch in Kinderwunschkliniken nach Tschechien. Ich hab mich in Tschechien sterilisieren lassen, g\u00fcnstig und recht unkompliziert.\n\nIn den Grenzgebieten sprechen viele Deutsch, und alles was mit Tourismus zu tun hat sowieso, also wenig Sprachbarriere, es gibt da gutes Essen und guten Schnaps, die Tschechen sind warme Gastgeber meiner Erfahrung nach.\n\nJagen soll in Tschechien auch sehr sch\u00f6n sein, kann ich jetzt pers\u00f6nlich nicht mitreden aber hab schon von Leuten geh\u00f6rt die das mit so einer Reise gemacht haben.\n\nUnd je mehr die Leute hinfahren desto normaler f\u00fchlt es sich auch an. Ich bin eher an der \u00f6sterreichischen Grenze aufgewachsen und war da sicher 14 Tage im Jahr, wandern, schifahren, feiern etc. Aber wir waren sicher auch 1-2 mal im Jahr in Tschechien.\n\nEs kommen auch viele zum arbeiten aus Tschechien her, und ich hab da selten irgendwelche Probleme mitbekommen. Meine Verwandschaft in Franken arbeiten mit vielen Tschechen zusammen, und ich hab meinen mega rassistischen Onkel noch nie was schlechtes \u00fcber Tschechen sagen h\u00f6ren. Viele Tschechen kommen auch zu Volksfesten oder Festivals her.\n\nDie Kultur ist nat\u00fcrlich zu Oberbayern schon recht unterschiedlich und hat eher Gemeinsamkeiten Oberfranken, Oberpfalz, Niederbayern, aber tschechische Grenzgebiete f\u00fchlen sich trotzdem nicht wirklich wie Ausland an, auch wenn es nat\u00fcrlich nicht wie in Tirol ist.\n\nIch wei\u00df ja nicht wo du wohnst, aber generell fahren ja im Westen auch viele mal nach Amsterdam oder Frankreich wenn sie k\u00f6nnen, da f\u00fchlst man sich sicher auch verbunden. Fahren Norddeutsche nach Polen? Nach D\u00e4nemark? idk?\n\nGenerell wei\u00df ich auch \u00fcber Tschechien einfach mehr als \u00fcber den Norden. Und es besteht einfach nicht diese Preissn Animosit\u00e4t. Das ist ja schon eine schlechte Beziehung die auf Gegenseitigkeit beruht, die m\u00f6gen uns ja auch nicht. Die haben da oben bestimmt auch cooles Brauchtum und shit, das will ich auch \u00fcberhaupt nicht bestreiten. Aber was der Bauer net kennt des frisst er net, verstehst?\n\n(PS: ich f\u00fchl mich auch dem Norditaliener mehr verbunden als dem Norddeutschen. Selbes Prinzip, mehr Kontakt und gegenseitiges Interesse)",

Frankly, I\u2019ve had a rocky social history (my mental health fluctuated alongside my level of extroversion so it was a bit of a rollercoaster). What I\u2019ve found is that, though there is an opted for normality in relationships, if you\u2019ve been having difficultly finding it then maybe it isn\u2019t for you. Especially when you\u2019re reentering the social world \u2014 online or in person. It\u2019s a pain in the ass to get for a lot of ppl (myself included). Being open about social difficulties in places that aren\u2019t compromising (such as new discord servers without people who u know irl on them) and just going for it has worked best for me. I doubt this analogy is what you want to hear, but if you don\u2019t put your hand out then nobody can grab it. There are countless people who want friends and would be ecstatic to have you as a friend, so try not to stop reaching out just yet. \nJust try to remember that you aren\u2019t the person for everyone, and not everyone will be the person for you. \nWishing you the best \ud83d\udc9f",

What did they want to become, what were there hopes for you? Perhaps include some nostalgic music\n2. Pretend to be a highly-intelligent character fitting to the task (Sheldon Cooper, Hermione Granger, Spock, Batman, etc). Don't get too carried away lol\n3. Visualize yourself starting\n4. Visualize yourself reaching your goal\n5. Watch study-with-me (this helps keep you accountable). I'd suggest watching Ruby Granger, Thomas Frank, or Unjaded Jade on YT for these videos, though there are many other good study-with-me makers\n6. Watch brief video of someone who has met your goal (ex. if you want to be an entrepreneur, watch Elon Musk, if you want to get into an ivy league school, watch admission videos, etc)\n7. Watch motivational videos\n8. Read motivational quotes (ex. \"a winner is a dreamer who never gives up\" -Nelson Mandela, \"genius is 1% talent, and 99% hard work\" -Albert Einstein, and \"work hard now, so you don't have to later\")\n9. Listen to music with no lyrics\n10. Make a schedule \n11. Give yourself little rewards \n12. Make a vision board that illustrates your ideal you\n13. Research productivity, and personalize it \n14. Eat healthy\n15. Get enough sleep\n16. Exercise \n17. Find confidence \n18. Read productivity books like: 80/20 your life, the 7 habits of highly effective people, the score takes care of itself\n19. Study with someone else (this is the same premise as watching a study-with-me, but make sure you pick someone who will won't distract you very much)\n\nSome things that can help: \n\n1. Get a comfy, minimal space to work. Pick somewhere you would only use to be productive. Also, try to include little motivations (inspirational quotes on the wall, your vision board in front of you, etc)\n2. Study your habits and mood, for example: when are you most productive? If you don't know where to start, research your circadian rhythm, and theta state\n3. Find your boundaries. For example, when I want to be productive, I avoid television completely. This is a bit radical, but I know that if I start watching minutes will turn into hours. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this was helpful! Have a productive day :)"

In fact, many of the occasions where this was a problem, I was acutely sad or anxious."

My intelligence has always been my greatest strength, though I've never bothered to build on it much. That's the vital difference between before I realized my stupidity and after. After, I was productive day in day out, on a minute to minute schedule powered by the force that has the greatest sway on me: fear. Undeniable, soul-smothering fear. \n\nOf course, the building of intelligence was a vast help. But, my routine started to fizzle. I've started gradually doing less productive things more often, leaving my plans in the dirt about three months in. Ever since, I've still been performing well in school, but I haven't been working out my brain regularly. Occasionally, I'll engaging in something good for me -- but it's grown to be a rarity. \n\nAt my school, the material is easy, and high-intelligence is enshrined in our values as something imperative. Thus, high marks are quite easy to come by if you put in the effort. And still, I feel a terror in my spine every time I get a grade. If it isn't 100%, then I feel driven to lachrymosity. It's really quite pathetic at this point. I'm not impacted by tweaks on my looks, my hobbies, and so on, but every time I get a bad mark my entire self image begins to crumble. \n\nAnd that brings me to the topic of this rant: I got a bad grade. Well, it's not even that bad when I rationalize it, but I still can't shake it. Ever since I got it I've been leering at my phone hoping it was a mistake. Obviously, it wasn't, but can't a girl hope? It's the source of all of my validation, and to see that threatening red number on the screen isn't much of a comfort, you know? Also, with every bad mark I get I feel an anxiety in my chess that's like stinging with no pain, and I start to get a headache. I'm dying over here, man. This was not pog. Not pog at all."

I am trying to figure out what they're saying so I can maybe have a clue as to who called me, since I have no idea. I don't want to share what number it was just out of privacy. The song is Mac DeMarco - Another One, as far as I can tell. I think one could use the audio from the song to edit this audio and have the voice by its own but I lack the skills to do so.

I've observed higher Te in the latter, too, but they're more diverse. I don't have enough information to identify any real trends--there aren't many of us grouped up and willing to talk--so I'd like to work on that.\n\nIf you'd like to participate but **don't know your type**, [sakinorva](https://sakinorva.net/functions) is a reliable test. You'll be looking for your \"**Grant**\" type once you've received your results.\n\nIf you think typology is BS, do an idiot a favor and humor me.\n\nIf you have any type-theory questions, I'll answer as best I can. I appreciate your help.\n\nEdit: If you're interested in reading up on functions, [this document](https://faculty.mtsac.edu/khigh/assignments/assignment_documents/jung_functions.pdf) (wouldn't recommend reading before testing) may be useful.

Ultramarines-The biggest legion, all-around capable, easy pick.\n5. Thousand Sons-I'm going to need some psychic shenanigans to hang with the Emperor, Magnus can help manage Perturabo.\n6. Luna Wolves-Another of the bigger legions, the Luna Wolves are also the most acclaimed, easy pick.\n7. Word Bearers-We need their knowledge of Chaos, plus they're the second biggest legion.\n8. Raven Guard-One of two legions with their specialty, they're the more competent/stable one, easy pick.\n9.

Sanguinius *is* loved more than anything else, but it isn't important to him.\n\n\\-Perturabo was only ever truly loved by one person (Magnus), while Sanguinius is loved by everyone.\n\n\\-Perturabo is the most analytically intelligent Primarch, while Sanguinius is the most emotionally intelligent Primarch.\n\n\\-Perturabo digs in the dirt, while Sanguinius literally flies.\n\n\\-Perturabo is an incredible artist who pays no attention to aesthetics, while Sanguinus values art perhaps more than any other Primarch and is clad head to toe in gold.\n\n\\-On the other hand, if fan theories about the upcoming Eternity Gate novel are correct, then they have both beaten the shit out of Angron.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLegions:\n\n\\-The Iron Warriors are villains who fight in the most methodical, detached way possible, while the Blood Angels are heroes who might be the single most aggressive out of all the legions (they are *literally* bloodthirsty.)\n\n\\-The Iron Warriors have a utilitarian, industrial aesthetic, while the Blood Angels' aesthetic is Baroque.\n\n\\-The Iron Warriors prefer to blast you from a mile away, whereas the Blood Angels like it up close and personal.\n\n\\-The Iron Warriors never got the respect that they deserved, whereas the Blood Angels might be the most revered First Founding chapter.\n\n\\-While alike in competence, the Iron Warriors excel in everything unglamorous, while the Blood Angels excel in everything glamorous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would love to see a story where they work together flawlessly and Sanguinius genuinely appreciates Perturabo. This slowly starts bringing out the good side of Perturabo that we have only ever really seen come out around Magnus, only for Perturabo to get jealous of Sanguinius' public adoration. This causes Perturabo to push him away and fail to learn anything as only my boy can.\n\nActually, I might do that as a fanfic."

Slowly but surely I was improving myself but I had some problems idek how to fix, it until earlier this year I have never felt so damn alone and depressed then I have in my entire life, I wanted to change but I didn\u2019t exactly know how to, that was until I found out what NoFap was.\n\nI\u2019ve heard about porn and masturbation addiction before and my ignorant ass back then thought it was a load of shit, but when I looked into it deeply\u2026 wow, all half my life I\u2019d never thought my issues were literally because I PMO and now it makes so much sense to me, I recently was on a 8 day streak, but I unfortunately relapsed, twice actually, but I noticed the changes I felt and thought \u201cthis really could turn my life around!\u201d Which I have confidence it will, and even when I looked at the fetish shit I felt sick just looking at it.

Phenibut the weakest, gabapentin in the middle, and pregabalin the strongest. Phenibut ofc is also directly gabaergic (as a gabab and possibly gabaa agonist), whereas gabapent/pregab may be indirectly gabaergic.  \nThe last time I took phenibut was January 8th.  \nHowever, I went thru a stint of relatively heavy pregabalin and gabapentin use. For the last 2 weeks of January I would use pregabalin at 400-600mg 3-4 times a week. Then on February 1-3 I used gabapentin 3600mg, 2400mg and pregabalin 500mg back to back days. Felt like shit the day after the last pregabalin dose and resolved to take a 2 week break from all gabapentinoids.  \nI made it 11 days but last tuesday I ended up taking 1200mg gabapentin as I\u2019d taken adderall earlier in the day and could not sleep for shit, and had a presentation the next day. Definitely felt the effects but they were pretty subtle, though 1200mg gabapentin is not that high of a dose. Slept well and felt fine the whole next day, no rebound or insomnia the following nights.  \nBack to phenibut.  \nIt\u2019s Mardi Gras here in New Orleans and I really want to dose late friday night so I can enjoy a day out with friends on Saturday. Ofc I haven\u2019t taken phenibut in like 5 weeks, but I have been using gabapentinoids a decent amount. **Given the fact that I used a low-medium dose on Tuesday night, will I likely be able to feel much enjoyable effects from \\~3 grams of phenibut taken late Friday night? Or should I just not risk it/not bother?** It\u2019s worth noting that I\u2019ve always found phenibut to be more euphoric and enjoyable than both gabapentin and pregabalin, it\u2019s honestly my DOC.  \nFuck\u2026wish I\u2019d just sucked it up, not taken the gabapentin on Tuesday, and let myself have a full 14 day reset."

                "body": "Phenibut, pregabalin and gabapentin all likely have cross tolerance as they all act on the alpha2delta site of calcium channels.  Phenibut the weakest, gabapentin in the middle, and pregabalin the strongest.  Phenibut ofc is also directly gabaergic (as a gabab and possibly gabaa agonist), whereas gabapent/pregab may be indirectly gabaergic.\n\nThe last time I took phenibut was January 8th.\n\nHowever, I went thru a stint of relatively heavy pregabalin and gabapentin use.  For the last 2 weeks of January I would use pregabalin at 400-600mg 3-4 times a week.  Then on February 1-3 I used gabapentin 3600mg, 2400mg and pregabalin 500mg back to back days.  Felt like shit the day after the last pregabalin dose and resolved to take a 2 week break from all gabapentinoids.\n\nI made it 11 days but last tuesday I ended up taking 1200mg gabapentin as I\u2019d taken adderall earlier in the day and could not sleep for shit, and had a presentation the next day.  Definitely felt the effects but they were pretty subtle, though 1200mg gabapentin is not that high of a dose.  Slept well and felt fine the whole next day, no rebound or insomnia the following nights.Back to phenibut.  \n\nIt\u2019s Mardi Gras here in New Orleans and I really want to dose late friday night so I can enjoy a day out with friends on Saturday.  Ofc I haven\u2019t taken phenibut in like 5 weeks, but I have been using gabapentinoids a decent amount.  **Given the fact that I used a low-medium dose on Tuesday night, will I likely be able to feel much enjoyable effects from \\~3 grams of phenibut taken late Friday night?  Or should I just not risk it/not bother?**  It\u2019s worth noting that I\u2019ve always found phenibut to be more euphoric and enjoyable than both gabapentin and pregabalin, it\u2019s honestly my DOC.\n\nFuck\u2026wish I\u2019d just sucked it up, not taken the gabapentin on Tuesday, and let myself have a full 14 day reset."

                "body": "In terms of cognitive and emotional effects, Is this really accurate?  I've heard that comparison been made, and I'm a bit skeptical but it also sort of makes sense.\n\nNever used meth, but I'm very experienced with potent stimulants like dexedrine and cocaine and of course caffeine feels like an ultra baby version of them, but can also be used daily without legit possibility of fucking up your life (though if you know what you're doing, you could use dex and even coke daily without major issues, except major heart problems from cocaine).  Caffeine only indirectly affects catecholamine release via a downstream mechanism, whereas dexamphetamine and cocaine have direct and thus far more potent effects here.\n\nThe kratom-opioid comparison is a bit more sketchy imo.  First of all, no \"non addictive natural remedy\" type bullshit: Kratom is a plant with a vast number of psychoactive alkaloids that produce unique effects and can entirely depend on one's dosage, strain, individual metabolism, vendor...among many other factors.  The main alkaloids, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, are *believed* to act as mu-opioid partial agonists.  However, it is possible mitragynine is an agonist an delta and kappa opioid receptors, but *also* possible it behaves antagonistically at these same sites.  Agonism/antagonism at each of these sites would produce extremely different behavioral and affective states.  Other alkaloids  could affect different adrenergic, serotonergic and dopamine receptors, as well as possibly block certain calcium channels.\n\ngenerally, potent painkillers/recreational opioids, such as oxymorphone and heroin, have a much clearer and well established common pharmacology: potent full agonism at mu.  This makes their effects far more predictable and consistent.\n\nI am very experienced with kratom (was looking for an alcohol replacement at the time - been using for 2 years now), but have never touched a legit opioid, nor even kratom extract, because I think I enjoy normal kratom maybe a bit too much.  But it has not fucked up my life, I have never been addicted nor withdrawn from it.  It actually allows me to function better, and I'll go to the gym, go out and socialize, or be otherwise productive while on it, not just hole up in my room and dose or something.  I use it in a way that one might use caffeine, but not everyday.   Just how much stronger, more euphoric, addictive and potentially life ruining is kratom in comparison to a \"harder\" opioid?"

I have hydroxyzine, xanax and Lyrica.  I fucking hate hydroxyzine because of how groggy it makes me and I would rather not have to pop a xan to sleep.  If I dosed like 500mg Lyrica tonight, is there a possibility of mild withdrawals down the line?

Ready?  Let's begin.**\n\n---\n\nI'm very proud of how this sub has grown over the last few years, and I really believe that it can be a great resource for both new and veteran YouTubers alike to grow and refine their channel.  Due to the way subreddits work, a lot of this information slowly gets buried, and even a search isn't enough to dig it back up again.  This is why we see the same posts with the same questions popping up over and over again.  To that end, we're going to focus on refining the r/YouTubers Wiki - this was a resource build ages ago by the early moderators of the subreddit, but which hasn't been updated recently.  \n\n### What you can do:\n\nThink of a topic that you want to know more about, or a topic that you've seen discussed repeatedly here in the subreddit.  Look for a top comment below and see if it has already been suggested.  If, **and only if**, it hasn't already been suggested, leave a top comment below with only that topic in the comment.  If you find your topic, great! Upvote it for more visibility.  If this works right and we all work together, we'll end up with a list of topics that people want to know about, weighted by interest.\n\nNow, as a reply to the top comments, if you have any **well regarded** resources about this topic, reply with that resource to the top comment.  Your resource **MUST BE** a mainstream source of direct information - **DO NOT** submit blog posts, videos from small YouTube channels, paywalled articles, online \"How To YouTube\" courses, etc.  **Do not link to your own content**.  \n\nNote: Your reply will almost definitely get caught in the Spam Filter and that's okay - we'll review it and release it.  This may take many days, please be patient."

We the Moderators have done everything we can to keep the discussions civil, topical, relevant and factual, but as we keep reminding you - we are only **volunteers** who have **day jobs, families, friends, social lives and hobbies** ***outside of Reddit.***\n\nBeginning today ***and for a duration to be determined***, politics will ***temporarily*** be prohibited on this subreddit.  Let me say that again for the people in the back:\n\n#No politics on r/Florida. NONE. Just Stop.\n\nThe long-term, low-maintenance, kindhearted, and valued users of this subreddit have overwhelmingly requested a return to normal, and the overworked and underappreciated moderators are more than willing to TEMPORARILY oblige.  We want pictures of sunsets, snake identification questions, complaints about I-4 traffic, and all that good stuff.  \n\nThis new rule will be TEMPORARILY enforced by AutoModerator filters, and what slips through will be manually handled by the moderator team.  Intentionally attempting to bypass the AutoModerator filters will result in an immediate permanent ban.  Making political comments on non-political posts will result in an immediate permanent ban.  Thinking you are clever by making dogwhistle comments will result in an immediate permanent ban.  \n\n---\n\n##FAQ:\n\n**1. Why are you TEMPORARILY implementing this rule today? Why not (days, weeks, months) ago?**\n\nFlorida is one of the hottest political climates in the country at the moment, and leading up to the midterm election there was a huge momentum of emotions, opinions and news articles.  Now that the midterm has passed, that momentum has cooled.  It's easier to stop a stream than a river.\n\n**2. Are you TEMPORARILY doing this because your candidate lost, you pathetic liberal?**\n\nThe r/Florida mod team does not have \"a candidate\".  As always, our only goal has been to maintain a civil, welcoming environment for Floridians and, yes, even tourists/visitors.  This has been planned for months, and you can look back at our official responses to the dozens of \"Why is this subreddit full of political garbage\" posts over the last few months if you don't believe us.\n\n**3. How will you TEMPORARILY define what is \"Political\" and what isn't?**\n\nIf you voted for it, voted against it, if it ran for an elected office or was appointed or fired by a government official, if Fox News or CNN reported on it, if there was a protest for it, against it, or about it, if you got banned for posting about it or commenting about it - it was political.  You'll know.\n\n**4. This is a stupid rule and you're stupid for TEMPORARILY implementing it.**\n\nThat's not a question.\n\n**5. But I NEED to talk about politics or my (reproductive organ/s) will fall off**\n\nThere are other subreddits like r/FLPolitics or r/FloridaPolitics, or you can go start your own.  We don't care where you do it as long as it's not here.\n\n**6. Why are you TEMPORARILY (shutting down free speech/infringing our first amendment rights/prohibiting us from ever talking about politics anywhere ever again)**\n\nWe're not.  We literally can't.  We are separating the General Florida Content from the Political Florida Content.  You are still allowed to talk about politics in a million places, there is one less place for you to do it, and two more places.  That's a net gain of one.  \n\n**7. How long will this** ***TEMPORARY*** **ban on political discussion last?**\n\nThis will be in place for ***at least*** the next four weeks, ***probably*** through the end of the year to allow moderators time to decompress from the last few months, and give us time to be with our families for the holidays.\n\n---\n\nThis will be TEMPORARILY implemented IN A TEMPORARY MANNER officially at 12:01 PM EST (17:01 UTC) Today, November 9th 2022 FOR A TEMPORARY AMOUNT OF TIME.\n\n---\n\nETA: Updated the post to insert TEMPORARY in as many places as functionally possible so maybe one of them gets noticed.\n\n---\n\nA list of subreddits where you can currently go to talk about Florida Politics:\n\n* r/FLPolitics\n* ~~r/FloridaPolitics~~ Edit: restricted\n* r/TheSunshineState\n* ~~r/1AFlorida~~ Edit: private\n* ~r/FLGovernment~~ Edit: restricted\n\nIf any more are created/discovered, send us a ModMail and I will update the list.\n\n---\n\n#This post will be locked at 12:01pm today.  Get your insults in while you can."

                "body": "Okay, I've finished Blightfall for 3rd time and I want to share with you my thoughts on best Bio-Domes:\n\n\n * **Alpha**\n\n**Pros**: Bio-Dome for beginners. There is Promethium, which \ncan be used to create Copper equivalent pickaxe. It's well-placed on the world, so you can easily get anywhere you want. Also you have Botania flowers nearby (Marble Shrine).\n\n**Cons**: Plains look booring. Come on! Also, as everywhere is dirt, base can be easily corrupted if you don't put Ethereal Blooms around it.\n\n**Summary**: It's a really good place to start as a beginner, but this place is boring.\n\n\n * **Beta**\n\n**Pros**: **This** is the best Bio-Dome possible - easy access to water, nearby villages and two islands - Eerie and Mushroom. After cleansing Mushroom Island there won't spawn any hostile mobs, the only drawback are occasional lava pools. From Eerie Island you can get awesome materials (and of course quests from The Dark One). In the Obsidian Tower is a broken Blood Altar - only one which exists in this world, and one of two that *can* exist in this world (as to create a Blood Altar you need to find a Ruby, which is only in one place).\n\n**Cons**: I  can't think about any.\n\n**Summary**: As I wrote, it's the best Bio-Dome to start - easy access to nearly everything. If you are familiar with some parts of Blightfall, start there.\n\n\n * **Gamma**\n\n**Pros**: Easy access to The End Portal, ice *blocks* Taint.\n\n**Cons**: There's nothing interesting in this biome except for The End Portal.\n\n**Summary**: If you want to have low-effort Ethereal Blooms and Totems of Dawn, start there. Also The Last Millenium is an important part of Blightfall's lore.\n\n\n * **Delta**\n\n**Pros**: Lots of gold, so if you know that you'll be using Thaumcraft or Thermal, start here. Per u/TheoneCyberblaze words, there are also a lot of Aura Nodes nearby, so it's easy to charge your first wands.\n\n **Cons**: Not much dirt and water, so it's hard to farm.\n\n **Summary**: If you are a capitalist pig who loves the sight of gold or you have a use for hardened clay, start here. It's a good idea to put Thaumcraft machinery in this Bio-Dome.\n\n\n * **Epsilion**\n\n**Pros**: Desert is the only biome where you can find Nether Quartz. Also there's a floating island nearby, so you can mine Glowstone. Also desert looks really cool. Underneath base there's a Skeleton spawner, which is really easy to find, as sand has fallen into spawner room.\n\n**Cons**: Damn sand everywhere! No one likes sand! And no dirt at all, so it's really hard to farm. Only water source nearby is that which flows to the Bio-Dome.\n\n**Summary**: Nether Quartz is really important in Applied Energistics. Before you get Quartz Duplication and Thaumatorium from Thaumcraft, it's the only way to get it in large quantities. \n\n\n* **Omega**\n\n**Pros**: Omega is the *second* best Bio-Dome possible - you have a lot of water and lava for eg. Smeltery, Taint won't corrupt your base, as you're underwater and a tree nearby has very good stuff (a map, Tool Forge, some Tinker parts etc.). It's really easy to get to ore caches, as they are underwater too). As you are in water, you have theoretically unlimited source of ink sacks. Also there's Underwater Lab nearby, so you can easily start Thaumcraft Infusion or Botania (as there's an Infusion Altar and Mana Spreaders). Underneath base there's a Skeleton spawner.\n\n**Cons**: It's underwater, so in the early-game it's hard to get out of this Bio-Dome. Also it doesn't have any cool ores (SPOILER: there's a copper ore beneath the rails \ud83d\ude00). It's **REALLY** hard to change size of the Bio-Dome, as you can only dig down - you are underwater! Additionally to make a farm you need a platform on water level.\n\n**Summary**: If you played Blightfall before or you are *living wikis* of Blightfall's mods and you want to challenge yourself, then it's the best place to start. Also underwater base looks sooo cool!\n\n\n\nWhat is your opinion?"

It is noted that gollum swore upon the ring that he would not betray frodo while he was the master of the ring.\n\nIn breaking that promise by taking the ring, he doomed himself, it's just the ring also happened to be in his possession when the rings nature brought about his doom.\n\nMy favorite part of all this is that, the ring itself is basically impossible to destroy and only my doom might unmake it, however what brought about the end of the ring was a series of choices, of Bilbo's mercy staying his hand, of frodo belief that smegol had good in him and that maybe it could be brought out, and even smegols honest hope that maybe with friends he didn't have to rely on gollum. \n\nAll of these things and more came together for good and bad and every single member of the fellowship played their part in making a difference in the fate of the ring for if things had not happened as they did that chance in a million that even gandalf barely dared to hope for would not have come to pass as it needed to.",

Sure Sam's brave last effort to get frodo up there was a galant one and frankly, since he wasn't the bearer, he was a tad fresher for the last push, but even the willing destruction of the ring was considered to great a task when the council decided on who would take on the burden of delivering the ring to mount doom.\n\nThe ring itself is, like most magic in Tolkien's work, a soft magic system, which is to say, unlike a magic item from a role playing game with stats, the ring is a force within that universe with the very soul of the dark lord inflicting its will on everyone around it, hell, it's own destruction was a manifestation of it's power over fate itself, not some stat or trait but simply the fact that the rings punishment for breaking an oath sworn on it was the destruction of the one who broke the oath, it just unfortunately happened that the one who broke the oath who was spared more than once by mercy, happened to be carrying the ring when his punishment was put into effect.",

Always CICO. loaded up on lean proteins and fruit (because of my pcos, i had insulin resistance, and i felt a little crazy/sick if i didn't have enough sugar). hope that helps!",

There isn\u2019t a logical reason the assume that people are evil. We don\u2019t go around murdering each other for fun, we don\u2019t steal for the sake of doing so, and the main thing people say is evil is the idea that humans try to amass as much wealth as possible. In this society we are told the money is basically the blood that keeps are veins pumping.\n\nIf anything is evil it is this society. I don\u2019t exist solely to be a labour slave to some factory owner that sets of their ass. I am not an individual person that must conform to the ideal being someone tells me to be, if something is wrong and harms someone that regardless I shouldn\u2019t do it and I as a conscious being an tell right from wrong and I am not ordered by nature to do so.

It isn't. You don't need to make every single relationship in fanfic/stories romance. You also don't need to make every single character in them romantic or heterosexual. Don't assume. \n\n  \n \\-I\u2019m tired of people blaming the fandom for making someone a \u201cwhore\u201d, it\u2019s actually very clear that\u2019s what happened here. No excuses. \n\n \\-As a general rule, the fandom is very against anyone\u2019s sexual orientation other than gay, unless they are doing some very specific things \n\n \\-Stop treating the characters\u2019 parents like they\u2019re actually like them. They aren\u2019t. No one is like their parents. You can\u2019t make a character with abusive parents look like your favorite abusive parent. If you want to hate someone\u2019s abusive parent, or whatever, go do that. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\n\\- Stop trying to be the internet\u2019s own morality police. Don\u2019t tell the fans what\u2019s acceptable or not. Fans make their own decisions, you\u2019re not the ones in control. \n\n \\-No one should be calling a person\u2019s mother (who may or may not be consenting) a whore or slut. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s not the person\u2019s mom, whoever it is. \n\n \\-A lot of it is also xenophobic, and bigoted, and there is this weird, almost \"we\u2019re all children so we\u2019re all a little bit racist\" attitude that happens in some of the chats. \n\n\\- The fandom is often times very mean spirited. Even when it isn't explicitly saying anything bad, it's still saying all the shitty things that anyone would say about other groups of people without realizing the harm it can do. \n\n\\-In my experience, there is a lot of internalized misogyny in the fandom \n\n\\-There are so many self-important assholes who think they can tell someone to kill themselves in a nice polite way and people let them do it"

Het lijkt erop dat klimaatverandering al zo ver is dat het niet meer te voorkomen is dat het minstens miljoenen levens gaat kosten en het lijkt erop dat grote delen van de wereld onbewoonbaar gaan worden. Het is ook overduidelijk dat er niet genoeg gebeurt om het te stoppen of omkeren.\nIk snap wel dat dit voelt als zelfverdediging opzich.\n\nVerder wel belangrijk inderdaad om te kijken naar de randvoorwaarden. Als mensen niet daadwerkelijk op zoek zijn naar het gesprek dan gaat het gigantische grenzen over. Alleen maar oproepen tot geweld mogen we niet toestaan. \nPersoonlijk weet ik niet of het realistisch is om nog te verwachten dat er iets verandert zoals het nu gaat rond klimaat. Multinationals en de investeerders die daarin de beslissingen nemen zijn overduidelijk niet van plan om winsten in te leveren om levens te redden. \n\nIk wil heel erg graag dat dit vreedzaam opgelost kan worden maar oprecht weet ik niet of dat realistisch is. Ik denk dat er veel mensen zijn die in hetzelfde schuitje zitten en dat die mensen perspectief nodig hebben. Wat kan er concreet gebeuren om op een vreedzame manier het tij te keren? Daar moet over gepraat worden.\n\nMaar inderdaad, als je hem al insteekt vanuit het idee dat geweld de enige mogelijke oplossing is en je niet bereid bent te luisteren naar alternatieven ben je gevaarlijk.\n\nMisschien ben ik wel te optimistisch. Ik geef dit soort bijeenkomsten vaak het voordeel van de twijfel, maar dat is zeker niet altijd terecht (Misschien kan he me wat dit soort dingen betreft zelfs wel na\u00efef noemen). \n\nEen vriend van mij is klimaatactivist en ik weet dat hij met dit soort dingen worstelt. Hij is pacifistisch, maar ziet ook dat er op dit moment maar bar weinig gebeurt. Volgens mij zit hier veel wanhoop en daar moet wel iets mee gedaan worden om degenen die wel aan boord willen blijven binnenboord te houden.\n\nDus het hangt denk ik wel af van het soort bijeenkomst dat dit was. Is er voldoende aandacht voor tegengeluid en discussie? In het artikel kreeg ik het idee dat de organisatie in ieder geval zegt dat dat er is. Maar of dat in de praktijk zo us weet ik niet. Misschien hebben de twee die graag een tegengeluid wilden laten horen nu afgezegd en is daarmee de kans van een nuttige discussie verdwenen, maar misschien ook juist niet. Lastig vind ik het.",

Walt was also working with Elliott with Grey Matter on what would later result in a nobel prize.   \nThen Walt met Gretchen's parents and found out they were rich. That was a problem. Walter had started a relationship with Gretchen because she was a lab assistant and he was her superior. He had always had a strong need to be superior to others (which we can see the results of in the rest of the series of course).\n\nSo, that is the moment where Walter makes the one decision that shapes the rest of his entire life. He walks out on the company and on Gretchen (no doubt leaving her wondering what happened, because they were happy), ending up selling his shares in the company too. \n\nIf he had stayed, he would have been happily married and would have been co-owner of one of the biggest companies in the world. He would have been a billionaire nobel-prize winner. \n\nWalter has a deep-seated inferiority complex and it leads him to making decisions that are actively harmful to him. This moment is the biggest one and it's the one that leads him to blaming everyone around him for what happens to him, while never actually looking at his own role in his misfortune. \n\nHe ends up resenting Elliott and Gretchen, but that is misguided. He made the decisions that led to his misfortune, nobody else. \n\nEven his cancer is strongly hinted to be a result of chemical experiments he did in the past. Now, there was probably not as much knowledge about it at the time and he couldn't have known, but he would at least have been able to afford the best care in the world. \n\nHe never learned to respect himself and it shows in how others treat him at the start of the series. The interesting thing is that others actually do respect him. We see a fondness from Elliott and Gretchen, we see Hank looking up to his genius and everyone thinks highly of him. But Walter's inferiority complex doesn't allow him to see that, putting him in a downward spiral where people can't help but take pity on the way he handles himself. \n\nI think it's interesting that the biggest moment in his life is one that happens offscreen. We can see hints of what happened there, but more importantly we can see the man he has made himself to be."

It hasn\u2019t happened to me ever since I reached my 20s. I receive no attention from men at all, positive or negative. Now, I am relieved that I don\u2019t have to deal with scummy men and that I can carry on doing what I\u2019m doing with no interruptions. \n\nYet, deep inside I wonder if there\u2019s something wrong with me or if I\u2019m not attractive enough to warrant these kinds of behavior from men. I feel so disgusting for even typing this because women have been killed, stalked or SA\u2019ed when they tried to rebuff these kinds of advances. I have seen my friends look uncomfortable or on the verge of tears in these kinds of situations. \n\nWhen the men ignore me completely by pretending they didn\u2019t see me or realize my existence because they were focused on my friend or female family member next to me, I can\u2019t help but feel offended, jealous, humiliated and insecure even though the attention they\u2019re giving is negative/predatory. \n\nYou just had to hit on my friend and talk her up (in a creepy way) while I\u2019m standing right next to her? You might as well be creepy or pushy to the both of us. Of course, I say this in my head. \n\nWhen the guy leaves, my friend tells me this happens all the time to her. I just listen and sympathize as she talks about her experiences. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I was unattractive, but damn. Better to have some kind of attention than to feel like chopped liver. I\u2019m so confused to why I think this way because sexual harassment is wrong and disgusting, and I was once a victim of it when I was a child, yet not experiencing it at all anymore makes me feel like I\u2019m not a woman worth any kind of attention. \n\nPlease tell me I\u2019m not alone when it comes to these thoughts and feelings.\n\nEdit 1: I don\u2019t actually want sexual harassment from predatory men. This was a post explaining my contradicting emotions and thoughts when I don\u2019t receive that kind of attention from men. And no, I did not victim blame or harass my friend about this. She doesn\u2019t even know I feel this way and I won\u2019t tell her at all. \n\nEdit 2: I have an amazing boyfriend and support group. My confidence is quite high despite me having CPTSD and being a victim of SA. I don\u2019t actively seek validation from people, especially men."

My favorite is when he\u2019s cradling me to him and my head on his chest. I feel so warm, safe and precious in his strong arms.

We tried missionary, anal, doggy and a handjob, but he couldn\u2019t cum in any of those positions and kept getting soft at the end. \n\nThis was the first time that ever happened in our three years of being together. He is very physically fit and I don\u2019t think he masturbates a lot, and usually has no problems with his sex drive/performance. And he still very much finds me attractive. He kept on getting frustrated and gave up. We tried sex at least three times but he couldn\u2019t finish. \n\nHe has been lately stressed about his personal life and I could tell he was pretending everything was okay but it\u2019s really not. He wasn\u2019t as sexually amped up as usual. It made me sad to see him try but give up a couple of times. What can I do when this happens? Should I initiate more by taking control or just stick with cuddling him extra hard and letting him know it\u2019s okay?\n\nEdit: I know it happens to the best and that men aren\u2019t machines. I was just concerned about him. This was entirely new to me. I\u2019m not judging him at all. I\u2019m going to be talking to him outside the bedroom to see what\u2019s going on, but this isn\u2019t a relationship subreddit so I\u2019m just asking for tips how to handle this in the moment during bedroom activities. I didn\u2019t bring it up to him and kept silent, and just cuddled back when he cuddled me because I didn\u2019t want to make things worse or awkward."

I severely underestimated how much physical and mental energy that chemo would take from me. Halfway through my round I just cried because I was just so exhausted from dealing with cancer and the other many stressors in my life. After I was discharged I felt like a new person but idk if that\u2019s for the best, I definitely matured as a person but in turn I became more bitter and depressed. I felt like a shell of my former self. I was so depressed the weeks after discharge, I was so despondent and devoid of any energy, my days were just filled with distractions in hopes to take my attention off of reality. \n\nAnd then I came across stardew valley and as simple as it may seem, I finally got a sense of purpose. Have you guys heard of that one guy in I think it was Africa, where he was depressed after his leg got amputated but then they gave him a cow to tend to and after that he wasn\u2019t depressed anymore because the cow gave him a sense of purpose? Well stardew valley did that for me. I fell in love with the simple lifestyle and the characters, and just became engrossed in the world for weeks. I was finally happy again, and from there I went on to pick up where I left off in life before my cancer and was able to keep moving on. \n\nStardew Valley will always hold a special place in my heart for being the game that got me through one of the toughest times of my life and I\u2019m just so thankful for ConcernedApe for making such a great game. Anyway, thank you if you bothered to read this, I know it\u2019s a lot.\n\n(I also wanna give a shout-out to my spouse Leah for the love and support she gave to my farmer. Her commitment to her passions truly inspired me to keep going.)\n\nEdit: Typo lol"

I\u2019ve always wanted to go but I planned on it later on when I was more financially secure (currently in college) and especially without my family. My mom is a very toxic and self centered person, but as a mother, she is great and so I respect her as a mother but not as a person. My step dad is more pleasant but he has no spine and has let my mom walk all over him. They are currently going through yet another divorce scare and I\u2019m just over them because I\u2019m tired of being put in the middle yet again, just like I was for my mom and my dad throughout my life.\n\nI recently just beat cancer (yay) and was going through some post-chemo depression (idk if that\u2019s a thing but chemo made me really depressed but I\u2019ve gotten better) but my mom insisted that I come along with her to Paris. I didn\u2019t want to go because we are lower-middle class and I didn\u2019t want to burden my parents any more than I already was with my medical bills. What\u2019s more I didn\u2019t want to go with them because I knew they would just fight all the time and that my mom would just complain about everything. \n\nWe\u2019ll fast forward to the trip and lo and behold I was right. All my mom is doing is complain. She\u2019s one of those negative people that just sucks all of your energy away and puts you in a bad mood. I\u2019m trying to not let it affect me but it\u2019s getting too much. What\u2019s more is that they\u2019re very embarrassing as they\u2019re stereotypical Americans that are loud and haven\u2019t bothered to try to learn the language and gets mad when their entitlement isn\u2019t catered to. I on the other hand have tried to be courteous when I interact with the Parisians by learning some of their common phrases and language so that I\u2019m not another obnoxious tourist like my parents. \n\nI\u2019m just tired of them, I\u2019ve gone off by myself a few times and I just end up feeling so lonely as I\u2019m in a foreign country with people that speak a different language. And all of my friends back home are asleep so it\u2019s not like I can just call them. I love my family but they can be so unbearable. I hate that I\u2019m letting them ruin Paris for me because I just want to go home.\n\nThank you for reading and I\u2019m sorry if I sound entitled like my parents."

It is the saving grace of the novel, but despite this I am simply not a fan of Adolf Hitler. Not for the reasons you most likely assume though.\n\nI've always been of the opinion that Adolf Hitler was more or less not a great person. And no, I know what you are thinking, I am not being unfair about this and holding his casual/hip use of meth. That was just the 30's, everyone was doing it. Your second guess is incorrect too, I am also not faulting him for starting a war.\n\nWar=Fighting. Fighting=Violence, Violence=Badass. If Poland didn't want to get invaded they shouldn't of had so much enticing farm land just sitting there waiting to get plowed by Germans. It was basically asking for it, if you ask me, but don't ask me that, Poland's Farmland is the one asking for it, so ask them, bozo.\n\nIt wasn't the tantrum he threw when Jesse Owens styled on everyone at the Olympics either. Petty, sure, but also Jesse Owens was a black man with confidence/talent born in the 1910's. In America. It's not like haters weren't something he was used to, it is just now it's a passive aggressive German with a casual/cool meth addiction. Tomato Tomato, as they say.\n\nSo after reading Mein Kampf (Translated into English means: \"Me Is Comfy\") I agree that 'Me Is Comfy' (Translated into German means: \"Mein Kampf) I agree it is rather dry. And after getting all the obvious reasons out of the way, I won't leave you stumped much longer.\n\nPersonally speaking, and this is just my opinion, but Mr. Hitler never seemed too fond of those of Jewish descent. I don't mean to generalize, but I'd be willing to say after a wild guess based off of his blunt vocal hatred of them, which he voiced constantly, and the fact that he did do a bit of a genocide.. I am of the opinion that he was racist. He also didn't like disabled people, queer people, and in general kinda brought a bad vibe when he was around.\n\nThat's why I don't like Adolf Hitler, and by extension couldn't get into Mein Comfy. However, I would be remised and just outright unfair to not acknowledge that Adolf's Banana Bread Recipe jammed in there while he was ranting about how jerking off to men with radiant blonde hair, deep blue eyes, and that are also jacked as Heck (Hell) totally isn't gay.\n\nHe is very straight and loves boobs A LOT, he states this every time after he in detail describes his obsession with Aryan Cocks for multiple pages (but if you read the text you would know this). This happens a lot. Like, a lot... idk man. What I do know is this Bananer Bread Bangs, Big Time.\n\nI assume that is why Mein Kampf is still taught in High School, but who knows. I think it should be banned due to the racism, however, prioritize banning Catcher in the Rye (literally ZERO RYE FIELDS IN THE BOOK, SALINGER IS A FUCKING LIAR), and Great Gatsby (If he is so great then why is he dead? That's cringe) first. Those are a far greater threat to the children."

It has also contain destroying capabilities of VMAT2 genes which possess divine power in our body.\n\nI can bet Vaxseen that it would create a war between public verses government. It would not be year of silence. It would be the year of huge violence which is unstoppable.\n\nNearly more than 200 political parties in our country which are purely controlled by pharma companies with 70% donation without any condition and 30% by other companies. Corporate is being totally controlled by organisation like WHO, WTO, UN etc. All these organisations are owned by few royal elite most powerful families who are ultimate of all.\n\nAny international event like world wars and this new illness were all pre-planned programme of elites. Now everything have been happening at international basis is to establish one world government.\n\nAkhilesh is doing great job by going against the vaxseen but he can not utter single on side effects of vaxseen openly because most of the political parties have been established in our country by the foreign funds of world elites. But he has used the right terms as orange vaxseen. World elites wanted severe minimise of human at our country upto 80 crores.\n\nHe want to play rebel but he give respect to elites by saying that when my government would come, he would provide vaxseen.\n\nAfter mass death through vaxseen, there would be rebel at every corner.The power of our government have been hijacked by world elites. From noteban to farmer bill are all their orders which has been following. Destroying every thing is the prime motto of our main minister.\n\nAccording to our religious father Shankracharya Shri Nischalananda said if the political parties would not come in support of people then many parties would close their shutter of politics. This is period where kaliyuga , the last period of according to sanatan religion would end in fees years. Like Raavan, Kansh, the villain of this period would come very soon from Isreal. All these drama have been happening for ending. Like Ram, Krishna , the hero of kaliyuga would be KALKI, already borned in orissa.\n\nNo politician can able to sleep, people will die with huge violence. The government want to kill to make one world government. People will kill to survive.Those who are real follower of God, will survive. Acid test for humanity .\n\nNo politician, no celebrities ,no corporate people will take a drop of vaxseen."

You have a bit of moral and societal responsibility to not engage in partition rhetoric instead try to bring people from an extreme to a moderate position. otherwise you are no different than the so called \"brainless apes\" you take seconds to dehumanize, and you are very much a part of the problem fueling division. Instead of putting up this performative bullshit, talking in jargons and quoting the hardest word in the thesaurus while typing long winded up essays only to have your cock stroked in your echo-chambers, use that energy to do something constructive for once. Stop malding over what some rightoid on chodi is saying, put your money where your mouth is and show us the right path and tell us where the trenches are.\n\nWe are open 24x7\n\n#"

I have a serviceable mental model of how Spring Boot works and how to make an app in it. What are the biggest differences between the two? Rails is certainly very quick to scaffold a CRUD app; what other QoL features do you guys love about Rails? \n\nIs there a guide for people who are taking this same path?

(doesn't present often)\n* doesn't \\_really\\_ care about anything yet makes mental lists about everything.\n* can drop emotional relationships just like that if they think it's not good to continue.\n* rarely shares about anything real that's in their head. when asked from strangers, answers are half-assed to keep the conversation normal and sound real, but yeah, not that much.\n* cares about what people in general think but it's weird as they live in semi-isolation (no outside activities except going to work) so there's not many people who they would need to care about.\n* has two close people who have been there from childhood. even if has tried, cannot let anyone else in.\n* with said two people, is more affectionate and bubbly than anywhere else\n* with strangers can adapt to the situation according to what has learned to be the best way to \"succeed\" but feels like a fish out of water (that surprisingly looks normal to others)\n* eye contact is forced yet trained to look natural. would prefer to not do it.\n* zen, zones out in conversations secretly (keeps nodding and stuff).\n* gives out insights and different points of views in small conversations, but they are often maybe too out of the box so perception is never really \"normal\" and so does this only sometimes.\n* honestly doesn't think their thoughts are in any way weird or uncommon, yet irl there seems to be so little people who do think the same.\n* outwardly accepting of everything, openminded maybe, but inwardly either neutral or negative towards most things. doesn't care about their opinion to share it too much.\n* writing & thinking style can outwardly change from \"feelery\" & polite to very robotic depending on what thinks is the most suitable way. would like to not care about it.\n* speaking style either slow and introspecting or quick and idea-wise incomprehensive (only towards those close two people). jams up different thoughts as they all just pop up in the head.\n* misses up words. a lot. anything can become anything when comfortable - calls the phone a fridge or the table a car. might be due to being almost fluent three languages, but so do their close ones and they don't seem to have this blurting out thing going on.\n* either super passionate (mentally, maybe not behaviorally) or no energy towards anything at all.\n* low idea of sexuality or gender roles, not by choice or some long social analyzing, just naturally doesn't care. likes that there are some structure to everything but doesn't care to follow them themselves.\n\nextra things (that have hindered typing):\n\n* female. hormones and stuff to go from feeler to thinker and back again and-- the loop continues.\n* highly functional autism is suspected due to father having asperger's and adhd. no adhd detected though. full life of masking history behind but can differentiate between them and real self now. just to take into consideration with some of the acquired traits.\n* northern european culture mixed with eastern asian culture from a young age - both very different and in mbti community are less common to base behaviours & thinking styles on.\n* illiterate and maybe a little bit dumb. not sure - at least not as anal about many things as people online seem to be, yet not as vague as those people would like.\n* suffered social anxiety and fears so past understanding of the system is flawed due to reading everything through that mindset instead of a clear head.\n* a decade of studying and i don't know anything at this point, lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nandd yeah. i would maybe go on for longer... but maybe that gives out a full picture?\n\nthis is, again, mainly for fun as i might never get to the answer, but it's always interesting to see how things i say are interpreted.\n\nthanks for reading!"

I'm wondering about other trans femme experiences in the airforce and other branches of the U.S. military. I've tried to get some general information online, but there isn't a lot of information. Please help me by sharing your experiences if you've been in the military or been in a similar position as I have. Thanks <3\n\nHello, my name is Alex and I am a 27 y/o trans femme. I've been on HRT for almost 2 years now ( it'll be 2 years on Jan 27th) I've had terrible luck with finding jobs since I graduated college almost 4 years ago. So I've been paying my bills by ubering. Yesterday my car died and I don't have the money to fix it or continue. I thought about selling it for the car's value, but my balance on the loan I owe is higher than the money I've paid towards financing the car. So I probably would end up owing the loan company money. \n\n(for context the car is the infamous ford fiesta) \n\nI don't have a lot of viable options at this time. one of them is hopefully getting another job soon, which may or may not happen. My friend has told me there might be an opening at their online job and if so, I'll take it if it comes. Another possibility is working as a 911 operator in my small town outside of Atlanta. I imagine that the job won't be as hectic as in the city, but who knows. My third and most probable option would be joining the military, the airforce specifically.\n\nYou may ask yourself, why the airforce? Well, I remember taking the ASVAB in high school and I scored pretty high on it then(I know I'll have to retake it). Also, the airforce seems to somewhat respect what job/role enlisted choose before enlisting(provided the requirements are met). I also have some distant relatives in the airforce and they always seemed to express how much they gained from their experience there.\n\nIf I join I was thinking of going into Engineering, weather/radar systems, electronics, or cyber systems depending on my score on the ASVAB. I am currently refreshing myself with practice tests to get a feel of what information might be on the test. \n\nHowever, they're not me, and more importantly, none of them are trans. If you have experience in the military in general your advice is welcomed. If you have experience in the airforce as a trans person your advice is also welcomed. If you are trans femme(i.e. trans woman, trans fem, etc.) and have been in the U.S. military, especially the Airforce please comment on your experiences if you have the mental bandwidth. Thanks in advance, much love <3"

My lack of empathy/disregard for other people's feelings/selfishness has led to several arguments between me and my loved ones. Thinking that empathy and love mean wishing the other person to be happy, I have reached the conclusion that everyone in my life would be so much happier if I just wasn't around.\n\nMy fiance would be happier with another lover, who is better at emotionally supporting him. I fail to see why he still loves me and I feel like I am undeserving of his love. He has a belief that a girl with my name (Nicole) would be his destined one. He has a classmate named Nicole, and when we first got together, he said that he thought the classmate Nicole would be \"the one\", but it turned out to be me... the thing is, my name is spelled as Nikol. So maybe I'm not his destined one after all, and he would be much happier with her. They share hobbies and I honestly have no idea why he's with me, I feel like there's nothing special about me or our connection, so why me and not someone else?\n\nIf I was gone, my mom would have no obligation to pay for my rent and food and everything. I am a stereotypical \"lives in mom's basement\" weeb and gamer, although I have prospects of making okay money with my art. If I was gone, she would adopt out my cat and feel free to pursue her dreams.\n\nI feel like I am not a good friend to any of my friends and they wouldn't miss me that much. I have no role in their lives, so they would get over it easily.\n\nEDIT: I've been trying to find a therapist to talk about this, but I don't have the money to do so, so I decided to at least get it out of my head and off my chest here on Reddit. I've had the second sobbing breakdown in less than a week thinking about this."

I don't really feel comfortable talking about my sex life with friends, and it's not exactly something my partner can help with, other than keep telling me \"you're beautiful and I love you\".\n\nI (21 afab nb) have a very small labia and almost a nonexistent clit. I feel incredibly insecure about it. It feels like I'm underdeveloped. It feels like everyone else who is insecure about their vagina/labia is afraid that it's big or uneven, and I'm just on the opposite side of the spectrum. With media/porn's love of petite and clean vaginas, you'd think I'm living the dream. \n\nI just really feel like I have underdeveloped sexual features. I have small breasts, my nipples are not sensitive, my clit is hidden under the hood and will not come out even when aroused, and my vaginal entrance is extremely sensitive to pain (I'm now using dilators to try and help that). The only real post-puberty feature I have are my large hips.\n\nIt's incredibly hard to feel pleasure from sex because my clit is basically the only sensitive part that I have, and, like the popular joke, it's extremely hard to find. I, as a nonbinary and previously masc-leaning person, have considered going on T just so that my clit would grow even a little bit. \n\nMeanwhile, it is also painful and impossible to have penetration. From my training with dilators so far, I have noticed that it only works at a very specific angle, and everything else will result in pain and be impossible to penetrate. (My partner who is into tank games jokes that I am a heavily armored tank that can only be penetrated at a 90-degree angle haha)\n\nI don't know why this is causing me so much distress to the point of wanting to cry every time I think hard about it. I'm certain I have some sex-related trauma from growing up in an extremely conservative country (think the Middle East) and I am slowly working through that. But I just can't help but feel like I am broken. Underdeveloped. That something is wrong with my body that prevents me from having a pleasurable and comfortable sex life."

I don't have the option to leave her with a family member, and she in general gets very lonely, and I know we would miss each other so much. I'm not sure if it would be better to find a loving home for her.\n\nMy flight will be at most 16 hours (if there's no delay), with a 2 hour layover, a 3 hour flight, another layover (possibly overnight, I haven't bought the tickets) and another 1-hour flight. None of the airlines accept cats in the main cabin. But I also feel like for such a long trip, a small cabin-sized carrier would be uncomfortable for her. \n\nSo how do I make sure she's eaten and used the bathroom on such a long flight? How will she react to being alone in such a scary environment (she doesn't take travel well)? Will she adapt well to the temperature change? We're traveling from the north to a tropical island. \n\nThank you in advance."

Cherie. I didn't like her character at all. She behaves as a selfish bitch. Why not to call doctors when her friend was dying because of overdosing, instead you call Frenchie and blame him for not being a good friend when he was on his mission? Or use Kimiko when she was angry about her brothers death, knowing that Frenchies feelings will also be hurt? Or frame Frenchie in front of Nina, when she robbed her and asked for his help?\n2. Starlights mom. I don't remember her name (and I don't want to), but she is an example of the most toxic narcissistic parent that will never have an excuse. I strongly hated when she tried to apologize to Starlight, and later shamed her for dating a wrong guy (who saved her ass a couple hours ago and, well, respect your daughters choice for once if you really love her). \n3. Maeve. I know that there are controversial opinions about her, but there are plenty of reasons not to like her. She is selfish, in fact, as she couldn't even tell her girlfriend the real reason why she is distanced from her (was it so difficult in fact?). She didn't seem (for me) to really care about people in the plane crush but her personal feelings about it. And throwing Novichok in the window in the end of S3 where could be citizens was not really out of character about her for this reason.\n4. A-Train. For me, he is the worst in the Seven after Homelander for many reasons. Firstly, he is the most selfish character in the whole show. When Deep is just pathetic and dumb, A-Train is cruel, egoistic, vile as*hole, who doesn't really seem to care about girlfriends murder or his brothers disability and is able to betray everyone just to get a pinch of praise. \n\nAnd what are your thoughts?

Found some differences between us, so I'm here. Favourite colours black, grey, beige. Love details. Gamer. Favourite genre - RPGs. In school read a lot, favourite books were philosophy and gothic novels. Favourite writers Poe, Lovecraft. Hate everything with romantic stuff, horrors and dramas, love thrillers. Don't like to waste my time on something I consider useless. Excellent student (gold medal, red diploma) etc. Disorganized and do something with some bursts of energy. Diagnosed anxiety-depressive disorder, with more anxiety. Mom is ENFJ, dad is idk him. Love cats. Love to talk about different stuff and am talkative with best friends and silent in companies. Snobby. Don't like people and avoid them in any way. Hate to meet new people, just want everyone to leave me alone. Love to accumulate facts in my head and discuss them. Love math and to explain things with some math equations or terminology. Have a strange sense of humour: do a lot of memes of my daily routine, colleagues find them funny, as far as I'm concerned. Best friend INTJ, we can discuss literally everything, and also we are both very sarcastic. She is interested in MBTI for 2 years and made me also interested in it.

Specifically, I'd like to work on movement since all of my figures tend to be quite stiff. I asked for some advice on learning methods on another forum and many people suggested going for fast sketches, either of actual people or stills from movies. While browsing here, however, some user mentioned that working on details is essential to understand and correct the mistakes you usually make. This resonated a lot with my past experiences in learning how to draw faces. \n\nSo my question here is: if I want to work on movement, should I concentrate on fast sketches or detailed ones? Yesterday I went back to more detailed sketching after a period of fast doodling and I feel like I learnt more in two hours yesterday than in two weeks of trying to capture movement with loose lines. Maybe I should work on both, but I'd love to hear some more opinions on this! "

My Nparents have always tried to control every aspect of my life. I have always done my best to fight them. They wanted me to study medicine, I didn't want to, and after months and months of screaming in the house I managed to choose my own path. Problem is, they kept telling me that I chose a stupid subject and that I would never get  a job. \n\nI have a lot of self-confidence issues in general, but this thing has made me very anxious about the labour market. They have been telling me for the past 8 years that I was useless and worthless and would never be able to provide for myself. Now I have graduated and I am looking for a job in the field I want to work in but I'm overly stressed about it, I'm afraid I won't find anything, I'm very self-conscious and dread rejection.\n\nLong story short, I had a job interview today. Nothing super exciting but it is in the line of work I would love to be in, and it's not a postgraduate programme, but a real job! I wasn't even expecting to ever get the possibility to be interviewed. I am LC with my Nparents but today she texted me just before the interview and I was afraid she might decide to call while I was in there, so I just told her that I had an interview. After that, obviously, she wanted to know every detail about the position and the job.\n\nGuess what. Her first reaction is \"Bleah. I hope you don't get the job\". \n\nI know I shouldn't be bothered by this. But seriously, after years and years of telling me I was worthless you cannot find it in yourself to be happy for me if I get an interview? She keeps telling me to apply to jobs I don't have the qualifications for, or sends me job openings that are near my parents' place because she wants me to go back (I live in a different country now). Also she suddenly decided I don't need a job, I can go back to studying or maybe I can \"go home\" and get my driving license. I'm sure she realizes that now that I live with my boyfriend in another country her leverage on me is almost gone and as soon as I get a job I won't need her anymore (my Nparents are still supporting me financially). She has spent years telling me I was a worthless leech of her money but then when I'm actually ready to start my life she suddenly doesn't want me to. \n\nSorry for the long rant, I guess I'm not even looking for advice or anything, just felt the need to rant. Thanks for reading. "

I've decided that it could be good for me to be a bit more vocal about my bisexuality. \n\nExcept I don't know how. I've always been quite honest about it if it popped up in conversations, so some of my friends know already - except that I never openly said \"I'm bi\" but went mostly for \"yea, I've also been with a girl\", actively trying to downplay the whole issue to a single experience. Now I realize that my friends seem to think that that's all what that was: straight girl tries girls and then goes back to normal and stable relationship with a man. I would very much like to clarify my position but, being already half-out, I don't know how to approach the subject. Going to them and telling \"hey, I'm bi\" seems, I don't know, redundant and attention-seeking. But I really need them to know that no, it was not a phase, and I don't know how. \n\nI find it really frustrating to be in this state where I'm not closeted but not out at the same time. Someone posted on this sub a very interesting article about bisexuality being a bit like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat and that's exactly how I feel now.\n\nAny advice? (I know you can't be in my head or my friends' either but who knows, maybe some of you had similar experiences) \n\nLots of love to you!"

They always get labeled as black or white, anything in between treated as a \"phase\", the usual bi-erasure stuff. On the one side I think the whole point of the series is to refuse labels, but then on the other I feel it would be important for the bi community that this series got some credit for the very good job it does at bi representation. \n\nAny thoughts on this? Maybe I'm just so desperate for representation myself that I get pissed at other people \"appropriating\" my culture? "

Play doesn't let the internal influence the external, Sleep doesn't let the external influence the internal. Energy then deals with... idk... the refinement of ideas in the realm they found them in.\n\nInformation is the kind of thing that seeks to unify the internal with the external \u2013 via learning and teaching, but doesn't spend so much time dealing with either on their own terms.

That is, whether the Lead-ness of a Need sets all its aspects into imbalance.\n\nBut then I remembered that (in the same way that Info-/Energy-Dominant is determined by the Last Animal) Double Observer/Decider is better determined by the Last Need.\n\nE.g. Consume Last is\n\n- Double Oi because Consume is Oe.\n- Double De because Consume is Di.\n- Double En because Consume is In. (Energy Dom)\n\nSimilarly, Oe Lead is\n\n- Double P because Oi is S.\n- Double C because Oi is B.\n- Double D because Oi is O.\n\nOpinions very welcome."
