My question is- would this be true, is there a specific order to the animals or can you group them in whichever order you think fits you best? Also, my friend who is an ENTP is saying he\u2019s a blast first, but that doesn\u2019t make sense if the theory says that blast firsts are always EJs or IJs, is this the case or can anyone be any of the animals first?"

I've always 'dismissed' it as a simple apology to Taylor L but it's so much more than that. While I think that Taylor's apology to Taylor L was sincere, I can also read Taylor's regret about John between the lines. A lot of songs in SN are intertwined, specifically the ones about Taylor L and John. Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that Taylor was never in love with Taylor L, just based on the lyrics alone: \n\"And if you never saved from boredom, I would've gone on as I was; I miss [...] how you held me in your arms that September night -> literally two days after Taylor wrote Enchanted for Adam Young after meeting up with him; You gave me roses and I left them there to die -> I wish the flowers were from you, cause I loved you from the very first day -> Dear John's secret message: I loved you from the very first day.\n\nBased on \"When your birthday passed and I didn't call\" we can safely assume that Back To December was written after February 11, 2010, Taylor Lautner's birthday. Taylor and John had already broken up based on a Lover Journal entry from February 13th. And I think that this was the period when Taylor started to reflect about what she had given up with Taylor L: -> \"I wrote Ours just before I turned 20, about a new relationship that people wouldn't approve of\" -> Taylor's birthday: December 13th -> I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind. She was so hurt that regrets breaking up with Taylor L even if she wasn't deeply in love with him, at least when they were dating (\"I realized I loved you in the fall\").\n\nOther lyrics that remind me of John and regret about him are:\n* I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't\n* Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine\n* And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind (Taylor Lautner is associated to summer, while John to winter)\n* I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright\n* I go back to December all the time, all the time\n\nSo yeah, 2009 to 2011 were difficult years for Taylor. Still cannot believe that she couldn't write anything after writing The Story Of Us for John and the next song she writes is All Too Well for that dickhead who missed her birthday.\n\nP.S. According to the Lover Journals, Never Grow Up was written before Taylor dated John (and before Taylor Lautner, too!)\nP.P.S. I realize I heavily sidetracked",

I think it could be interesting.\n\n**June 16, 2010**: [From a Lover Journal] *The Story Of Us* is the last song Taylor writes before having [a writer\u2019s block](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2012/10/17/taylor-swift-red-interview/1637307/) that will end 6 months later.\n\n* \"There\u2019s a kind of bad that gets so overpowering you can\u2019t even write about it. When you feel pain that is so far past dysfunctional, that leaves you with so many emotions that you can\u2019t filter them down to simple emotions to write about. That\u2019s when you know you really need to get out.\"\n\n**Late December 2010**: *All Too Well* is born during a Speak Now Tour rehearsal.\n\n* [Interview with Pop Dust](https://www.popdust.com/i-love-living-a-life-that-i-can-write-about-talking-with-taylor-swift--1889582428.html): The lyric I\u2019m most proud of on the album is from \u2018All Too Well\u2019: \u2018And you call me up again just to break me like a promise / so casually cruel in the name of being honest.\u2019 That was something I came up with while ranting during a soundcheck. I was just playing these chords over and over onstage and my band joined in and I went on a rant. Those were some of the lines I thought of. I was going through a really hard time then, and my band joined in playing, and one of the first things that I came up with, just, like, spat out, was \u2018And you call me up again just to break me like a promise, so casually cruel in the name of being honest.\u2019\n\n**February 2011**: *All Too Well* is reworked. This is probably the Ten Minute Version.\n\n**First week of March 2011**: *All Too Well* is edited thanks to Liz Rose.\n\n* [Liz Rose to Rolling Stone](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/liz-rose-songs-taylor-swift-little-big-town-20141024): When we wrote the song, I hadn\u2019t heard from her in awhile. She hadn\u2019t really been writing. I was in Nashville one day, slowly moving the last bits of junk out of my garage so I could move to Dallas. [\u2026] I was in my driveway and my phone rings, and it\u2019s Taylor saying, \u2018Man, I\u2019ve got this thing and I really need you to help me with it. Can you write today? What are you doing today?\u2019 [I later] drove over to Taylor\u2019s. It was the first song she wrote for that record, I think. She had a story and she wanted to say something specific. She had a lot of information. I just let her go. She already had a melody and she started singing some words, and I started writing things down, saying, \u2018Ok, let\u2019s use this, let\u2019s use that.\u2019 She mentioned a plaid shirt, and I wrote that down in a corner, and when we got to the end, I said, \u2018Let\u2019s put the plaid shirt in there.\u2019 That turned into one of the best lines. [\u2026] It was the most emotional, in-depth song we\u2019ve ever written.\n\n**March 19, 2011:** [While in Madrid](https://www.music-news.com/news/UK/41485/Read), Taylor writes *Better Man*.\n\n* [Taylor talking about it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/qv8su1/new_taylors_version_alexa_skill_for_111621/) Transcript: The song Better Man is one that I originally wrote for the Red album. I remember I was on tour, and I wrote it alone in a hotel room. And I remember standing in front of a mirror\u2014I think the first thing I thought of was, \u2018I wish it wasn\u2019t 4am, standing in a mirror, saying to myself, \u2018you know you had to do it.\u201c That was an actual visual from my life that ended up being the first thing I wrote, and then I expanded outward from there. And it was a song that I really thought belonged on the album and there were just too many songs I loved that I had written in that period of time, so some of them had to be left off. I think I chose All Too Well over Better Man. I think that was what happened. I was either going to put on All Too Well or Better Man, and then I left off Better Man.\n\n**May 22, 2011:** During a [brief interview](https://youtu.be/PZ_8h7Gu1G4?t=140) at the Billboard Music Awards, Taylor says she\u2019s \u201cbeen constantly writing lately.\u201d\n\n**Late May/early June 2011**: Taylor writes *Sad Beautiful Tragic* on her ukulele on her tour bus, reminiscing about a relationship that ended months ago.\n\n* [Billboard Interview](https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474565/taylor-swift-qa-the-risks-of-red-and-the-joys-of-being-22): \"\u2018Sad Beautiful Tragic\u2019 is really close to my heart. I remember it was after a show and I was on the bus thinking about this relationship that ended months and months before. The feeling wasn\u2019t sadness and anger or those things anymore. It was wistful loss. And so I just got my guitar and I hit on the fact that I was thinking in terms of rhyming; I rhymed magic with tragic, changed a few things and ended it with what a sad beautiful tragic love affair. I wanted to tell the story in terms of a cloudy recollection of what went wrong. It\u2019s kind of the murky gray, looking back on something you can\u2019t change or get back.\"\n\n* *Sad Beautiful Tragic* is a demo and it was recorded once.\n\n**Speculation:**\n\n* The date is not confirmed but the secrete message is \u201cWhile you were on a train\u201d and Jake Gyllenhaal [joined Mumford & Sons](https://href.li/?https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/photo-gallery/16169820/image/16169872/Pictures-Jake-Gyllenhaal-Chilling-Mumford-Sons-Winston-Marshall?utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=US:IT&utm_source=direct) in late April in their Railroad Revival Tour\u2026 on a train. Taylor wasn\u2019t on tour in April, she reprised it on the 27th of May.\n\n**June 11, 2011**: Taylor says, during a show in Detroit, that she had written [10 songs, all of them sad.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/10/you-belong-with-me)\n\n* In Detroit, Swift seemed somewhat melancholy. Once in a while, I had the feeling that she was on the verge of bursting into tears. She said that she had recently decided that life is \u201cabout achieving contentment... You\u2019re not always going to be ridiculously happy.\u201d She had written about ten songs so far for her next album. Asked to characterize them, she said, \u201cThey\u2019re sad? If I\u2019m being honest.\u201d The most recent one, she said, \u201cis about moving on.\u201d\n* I think that the songs written were: *All Too Well, I Almost Do, Sad Beautiful Tragic, The Moment I Knew, Better Man.*\n* \u201cI Almost Do' is a song I wrote about the conflict that you feel when you want to take someone back, and you want to give it another try, but you know you can\u2019t. And you can\u2019t because you know it\u2019s hurt you so deeply that you know that you couldn\u2019t bear to go through that again. So you\u2019re sitting there and wondering where they are and hope that they think about you and that you\u2019re almost picking up the phone call, but you just can\u2019t. I think I needed to write this song in order to not call that person actually. I think that writing the song was what I did instead of picking up the phone.\u201d\n\n**June 17, 2011:** \\[From a Lover Journal\\] Taylor mentions \u201cfeeling blissfully happy\u201d especially since she wrote \u201cthose 2 songs\u201d, which she will record after flying back to Nashville after the show in Pittsburgh, PA. One of them may be *State Of Grace*.\n\n* [On Good Morning America] \"I wrote this song about when you first fall in love with someone \u2014 the possibilities, kind of thinking about the different ways that it could go. It\u2019s a really big sound. To me, this sounds like the feeling of falling in love in an epic way.\"\n\n**June 24, 2011:** Taylor meets up with [Lori McKenna](https://href.li/?https://twitter.com/lorimckennama/status/973173983058251777?lang=en) at her house. They write *I Bet You Think About Me.*\n\n* \"\u2018I Bet You Think About Me\u2019 is a song I wrote with Lori McKenna, who is one of my favorite singer-songwriters ever. I\u2019d always wanted to work with her. And I wrote this with her at her house when I was playing Foxboro Stadium on the Speak Now Tour. We wanted this song to be like a comedic, tongue in cheek, funny, not caring what anyone thinks about you sort of break up song, because there are a lot of different types of heartbreak songs on Red. Some of them are very sincere, some of them are very stoic and heartbreaking and sad. We wanted this to be the moment where I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t care about anything.\u2019 And we wanted to make people laugh with it, and we wanted it to be sort of a drinking song, and I think that that\u2019s what it ended up being.\"\n\n**June 30, 2011:** [From MySpace] Lately, I've been writing a LOT. Like, all of a sudden, everything I've wanted to say, express, or just let out for the past several months has just recently become a song. I'm really excited about that. It's a freeing feeling when all of a sudden one day, you're able to verbalize exactly how you feel in a verse, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus pattern.\n\n**August 26, 2011**: [Kuk Harrell](https://href.li/?https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/justin-bieber-taylor-swift-write-228570/) tweets that Taylor and Justin Bieber wrote a song together, called *Cannon Balls*.\n\n**August 31, 2011:** *Cannon Balls* is reworked. Tom Strahle, one of Justin Bieber's collaborators, talked extensively about the song in [these lives](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/phvu0t/one_of_justin_bieber_collaborator_revealed_cannon/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).\n\n**September 8, 2011**: \\[From Lover Journal 1\\] Taylor writes *Red* on a plane on her way to Nashville. Taylor and Nathan Chapman record the demo in the evening, at the Pain in the Art Studio. A second demo exists. These demos are NOT produced with Dann Huff, unlike the album version.\n\n* [VH1\u2019s Storytellers] \"This relationship that I had that was, like, the worst thing ever and the best thing ever at the same time. I was writing this song and I was thinking about correlating the colors to the different feelings I went through. You have the great part of red, like the red emotions that are daring and bold and passion and love and affection. And then you have on the other side of the spectrum, jealousy and anger and frustration and \u2018you didn\u2019t call me back\u2019 and \u2018I need space.\"\n\n**September 9, 2011**: \\[From Lover Journal 1\\] She\u2019s in the studio to record again.\n\n**October 18, 2011**: \u201c[I have written 25 songs so far.](https://href.li/?https://web.archive.org/web/20111223052503/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/taylor-swift-album-wonderstruck-perfume-250807)\u201d\n\n* Some of these 25 songs include: *State Of Grace, Red, All Too Well, I Almost Do, Stay Stay Stay, Sad Beautiful Tragic, The Moment I Knew, Girl At Home, Better Man*. All of them are solo written and produced only by Chapman, which resembles the process in Speak Now. Others songs are *I Bet You Think About Me with Lori McKenna* and *Cannon Balls with Justin Bieber*, so 11 songs in total and 14 are missing. It's possible that Cannon Balls wasn't counted since it was supposed on Bieber's album.\n* \"The song \u2018Stay Stay Stay\u2019 is a song that I wrote based on what I\u2019ve seen of real relationships, where it\u2019s not perfect, there are moments where you\u2019re just so sick of that person, you get into a stupid fight. It\u2019s still worth it to stay in it. There\u2019s something about it that you can\u2019t live without. In the bridge it says, \u2018I\u2019d like to hang out with you for my whole life\u2019 and I think that\u2019s what probably the key to finding the one, you just want to hang out with them forever.\"\n\n**Speculation**:\n\n* According to a Reputation Secret Sessioner, *Girl At Home* is a demo.\n\n**Early December 2011**: Taylor writes *Begin Again*.\n\n* The song is supposedly for Will Anderson from Parachute. On December 8th, they were photographed together [in a caf\u00e9, on a Wednesday, eight months after Taylor had broken up with Jake for good.](https://www.eonline.com/news/279354/omg-did-taylor-swift-land-herself-a-new-man) Additionally, the white dress she wears in the single cover is the same she wore at [his birthday party on May 5, 2012](https://makemydaymisstay.tumblr.com/post/22742681798/taylor-swift-on-will-andersons-birthday-may).\n\n**December 13, 2011**: Taylor turns 22.

It immediately made me think of like how much fun they must have had that night. It was back in the late '40s. I ended up reading underneath that it was Ethel Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. And they were, like, 17. So I just kind of wrote that song from that place, not really knowing how they met or anything like that.\n\n* Description of the *Starlight Studio Demo*: \"3:37 minutes long. This demo is much rougher sounding than the released version. The verses are acoustic guitar-driven, there are less spacey sounds, and there are much louder background vocals as the song builds.\"\n\n**January 2012**: \u201cWith Red, \\[Scott Borchetta\\] [came to me in January](https://href.li/?https://web.archive.org/web/20121221175440/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2012/10/17/taylor-swift-red-interview/1637307/) and said, \u2018I think the album\u2019s finished.\u2019 This time, I said, 'No, it\u2019s not \u2013 I need to keep writing.\u2019 At that point, she went to Chapman and told him she wanted to work with other producers, too.\u201d\n\n* Red (Album Version), Begin Again and Starlight are co-produced by Dann Huff. While Red and Begin Again have the same credits, Starlight has others mixers, musicians and so on. My guess is that Dann Huff was called to work on Red because Borchetta didn't like the two demos [(Interview with Time)](https://time.com/3583129/power-of-taylor-swift-cover/), then he worked on Begin Again, likley on the same session as Red, and shortly after on Starlight. I bet that the guitar in the Starlight Demo was played by Chapman because in the Starlight credits you see \"Electric Guitar Solo - Conceived by Nathan Chapman, Played by Dann Huff\", which I think confirms Huff's involvement at a later date.\n* I think after this recording session Borchetta was satisfied and wanted to wrap up the album.\n\n**January 19, 2012:** Taylor [meets Rory Kennedy](https://href.li/?https://www.gettyimages.ae/detail/news-photo/filmmaker-rory-kennedy-and-singer-taylor-swift-attend-the-news-photo/137384361) (Conor\u2019s aunt), at the Sundance Film Festival, where a documentary about Ethel Kennedy premiered.\n\n* [Washington Post] \"And then her daughter Rory ended up coming to a show a couple weeks later and I told her about the song and she was like, 'you have to meet my mom, she would love to meet you.\u2019 So that was kind of what that song was about.\n\n**January 21, 2012**: Taylor meets Ethel Kennedy.\n\n* \"When asked how the odd-couple friendship came to be, Swift said her acquaintance with the daughter led to an introduction to the mother. \u201cI had read up on Robert F. Kennedy and his wife, and I asked Rory if it would ever be possible for me to meet her mother. She said, \u2018Here\u2019s her number.\u2019 Ethel was kind enough to have lunch and spend a few hours talking with me, and ever since then I\u2019ve been so inspired by how full of life she is and the way she tells her story.\u2019\u2019\n\n**February 2012**: \\[From a Lover Journal\\] Taylor writes *Holy Ground*.\n\n* [Taylor to Daily Motion (video interview)](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xuj5e4): \"The song \u2018Holy Ground\u2019 was a, a song that I wrote about the feeling I got after years had gone by and I finally appreciated a past relationship for what it was, rather than being bitter about what it didn\u2019t end up being. And I was sitting there thinking about it after I\u2019d just seen him and I just, I was just like, \u201cYou know what, that was good.\u201d It was, it was good, having that in my life, and I wrote the song and I immediately heard Jeff Bhasker\u2019s production. I hadn\u2019t ever worked with Jeff, but he has done some amazing work. I, I love what he\u2019s done on Fun\u2019s record, and I love his diversity. He\u2019s just so talented, and so I called him and I said \u201cI wrote this song. I really want you to work on it with me.\u201d And I played it for him and he was like, \u201cLet\u2019s go! This is great!\u201d And, and he did such an amazing job on it.\"\n\n**March 2, 2012**: \\[From a Lover Journal\\] Taylor writes *Nothin\u2019 New* and *The Lucky One*, both in Perth, Australia. They have similar themes and were allegedly inspired by Joni Mitchell and Kim Wilde.\n\n* The \u2018Lucky One\u2019 is a song I wrote while I was in Australia.  It kind of talks about some of my fears through telling the story of other people that I was inspired by.  More than their stories being told, I\u2019m pretty much singing about what I\u2019m scared of in that song, ending up kind of caught up in this whole thing and lonely and feeling misunderstood and feeling like when people think you\u2019re lucky that you\u2019re really not. It kind of expresses my greatest fear of having this not end up being fun anymore, having it end up being a scary place. Some people get there, some people end up there. It\u2019s a story song and it\u2019s something I\u2019m really proud of because it kind of goes to a place that I\u2019m terrified of. [...] There\u2019s the microscope that\u2019s always on you. The camera flashes, the fear that something you say will be taken the wrong way and you\u2019ll let your fans down. You\u2019re scared of a lot of things for a lot of the time, but the trade-off of being able to get on a big stage and sing your songs \u2014 it\u2019s worth it.\"\n\n**April 11, 2012**: Taylor has a writing session in LA at [Dan Wilson's house](https://taylor-on-your-dash.tumblr.com/post/668759126381379584/this-is-taylor-on-april-11-2012-this-is-dan). The first song they write is *Treacherous*.\n\n* [From Taste Of Country](https://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-red-interview/) \"I wrote \u2018Treacherous\u2019 with Dan Wilson, and we came up with a way to say, you know, \u2018This is dangerous and I realize that I might get hurt if I go through with this, if I move forward with you. But\u2026 but I want to.\u2019 You know? It\u2019s like that kind of conflicted feeling of it being a risk every time you fall in love \u2014 especially with certain types of people. [Laughs] That was a song that I\u2019m really proud of, because it\u2019s got this bridge that sounds like a second chorus. It\u2019s got all these big vocals, and it\u2019s kind of the intensity of that moment when you\u2019re deciding to let yourself fall in love with someone.\"\n* [From a Dan Wilson Interview](https://href.li/?http://www.avclub.com/article/dan-wilson-semisonic-adele-and-sincerity-taylor-sw-203435) \u201cWith Taylor, we had been kind of circling around, very much aware of each other\u2019s work for a while. We figured out these two days to work together and she came to my studio super excited and said, \u201cI had an idea in the car.\u201d And she sang me the first three or four lines of it and said, \u201cI want to call it \u2018Treacherous\u2019 and maybe the chorus can go like this.\u201d And we were writing the song in 10 minutes and she was just so full of excitement.\u201d\n* The drums are credited to Wilson in the *Treacherous Demo*, not to Aaron Sterling like in the final version.\n\n**April 12, 2012:** Taylor and Dan Wilson write *Come Back...

The [first song](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/qr5z8o/message_in_a_bottle_is_a_total_pop_banger/) they write is *Message In A Bottle*. While in the middle of recording Message In A Bottle, a friend of an ex walks in the studio asking if Taylor and his friend were getting back together: *We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together* was born.\n\n* [USAToday Interview] \"It\u2019s a definitive portrait of how I felt when I finally stopped caring what my ex thought of me. He made me feel like I wasn\u2019t as good or as relevant as these hipster bands he listened to\u2026So I made a song that I knew would absolutely drive him crazy when he heard it on the radio. Not only would it hopefully be played a lot, so that he\u2019d have to hear it, but it\u2019s the opposite of the kind of music that he was trying to make me feel inferior to. She also sarcastically explained the song as a \u201creally romantic song... Touching and sensitive...To my lovely ex boyfriend.\u201d\n\n**Speculation:**\n\n* It is not confirmed but the friend of the ex seems to be Adam Levine from Maroon 5, a very old friend of Jake.

She didn\u2019t like that but I forced it upon her!\"\n\n**May 28, 2012**: Taylor and Ed arrive in Santa Monica, CA. They start recording *Everything Has Changed* and *Run* at Ruby Red Productions with Butch Walker and Jake Sinclair.\n\n**May 29, 2012**: Gary Lightbody joins Taylor in the studio [thanks to Ed](https://href.li/?https://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/snow_patrol_-_gary_lightbody_on_breaking_writers_block_beating_alcoholism_a/). The two of them plus Jacknife Lee write and record The Last Time in less than 9 hours, produced by Lee in his studio in Topanga, CA. The album version is the very first attempt. Gary will also provide backing vocals for *Everything Has Changed*.\n\n* [Taylor to NPR](https://choice.npr.org/index.html?origin=https://www.npr.org/2012/11/03/164186569/taylor-swift-my-confidence-is-easy-to-shake): The idea was based on this experience I had with someone who was kind of this unreliable guy. You never know when he\u2019s going to leave, you never know when he\u2019s going to come back, but he always does come back. My visual for this song is, there\u2019s a guy on his knees sitting on the ground outside of a door. And on the other side of the door is his girlfriend, who he keeps on leaving \u2014 and he keeps coming back to her, but then he leaves again. He\u2019s saying, \u2018This is the last time I\u2019m going to do this to you.\u2019 And she\u2019s saying, \u2018This is the last time I\u2019m asking you this: Don\u2019t do this again.\u2019 And she\u2019s wondering whether to let him in, and he just wants her to give him another chance, but she doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to break her heart again. It\u2019s a really fragile emotion you\u2019re dealing with when you want to love someone, but you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s smart to.\n\n* [Gary Lightbody to Rolling Stone](https://href.li/?https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/where-has-snow-patrol-been-hear-frontman-gary-lightbody-tell-all-628508/): It was so fast. She works really fast. She\u2019s extraordinary. We actually did that song, wrote it and recorded it in a day. And that was the version of it on the record, which is very rare. Normally you write and record something with somebody and then down the line they\u2019ll record it, if you\u2019re lucky. With her, the whole thing was done in nine hours. I hope we can do it again sometime!\n\n**June 1, 2012:** \\[From a Lover Journal\\] After the Walmart Shareholders Concert held in Arkansas, Taylor returns to LA and while on the plane she writes *22*, which she brings to a writing session with Max Martin and Shellback.\n\n* [Interview with Ryan Seacrest] I wrote that about my friends, like finally I\u2019ve got this amazing group of girlfriends and we tell each other everything, we\u2019re together all the time. And I think that was kind of the marker of me being 22, like having all these friends and there\u2019s all these question marks in your life, but the one thing that you have is that you have each other.\n\n**June 2, 2012:** \\[From a Lover Journal\\] Taylor brings the chorus of *I Knew You Were Trouble* to Max Martin e Shellback. Both *22* and *I Knew You Were Trouble* are recorded during this week.\n\n* [Interview with MTV](http://www.mtv.com/news/1698897/taylor-swift-knew-you-were-trouble-bad-boys/): Taylor said that she brought the melody from piano to Max Martin and Shellback, who worked with her to \u201cinfuse a little bit of dubstep\u201d and \u201cmake it sound as chaotic as that emotion felt.\u201d She regarded it as one of the most adventurous songs from Red.\n\n**Early June 2012:** Jacknife Lee [talks](https://palegingerbabies.com/post/174178532598/we-met-through-garys-friendship-with-ed-sheeran) about some bombastic songs written with Harry Styles, requested by the label.\n\n* The date is not confirmed but it's the only week where Harry was free (1D were on tour).\n\n**July 4, 2012**: Taylor performs *Starlight* for Ethel Kennedy.\n\n**Somewhere during the writing process**: *Babe* with Pat Monahan from Train (recorded, 2012), The Very First Night (2012), Unknown Song with [Ryan Adams](https://href.li/?https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/09/21/ryan-adams-taylor-swift-1989-cover-album/72522660/), *Unknown Song with T-Pain* (I can\u2019t find the source); *Unknown Song written in New Zealand* (mid March 2012, mentioned by Taylor herself on Amazon Music).\n\n**Other Songs**: *Both Of Us, Safe & Sound, Eyes Open*, they were all written and recorded in 2011. *Ronan* was written in October 2011. None of them were meant for Red.\n\n**End of the writing process:** \u201cThe singer also revealed that she wrote [\"30 to 35?\u201d](https://href.li/?https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/08/taylor-swift-reveals-new-album-red-drops-new-single-we-are-never-getting-back-together-abc-exclusive/) songs for the album and but whiddled it down to 16 tracks.\u201c\n\nLast edited: December 30, 2021.

Some dates might be wrong, I was not in the fandom when Fearless was released, I joined shortly after Fearless Platinum dropped. If you saw the rollout of the release, I'd love to hear your story!\n\n**Early 2005:** Taylor has a writing session with the Warren Brothers. Possibily they write *That's When*.\n\n* [[BMI Article from May 2005]](https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20050512Taylor_Swift_Songwriter_Taylor_Swift_Signs_Publishing_Deal_With_) \u201cShe has written songs with a list of renowned writers including Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, and the Warren Brothers.\u201d\n\n* [Alexa Skill for Taylor's Version] \u201cThat's When is a song that I wrote with the Warren Brothers and it was really fun writing with them because they're just hilarious people in general and I remember it was a classic Nashville songwriting session: you sit around a room, you go to a publishing office, you sit around in a room, everybody's got guitars and we just kind of came up with this song about space and independence and what happens when two people love each other but one of them just needs to take a breather and think about it and what would happen if rather than saying \"No, if you're not sure, then leave and I don't want to talk to you ever again\", what would happen if the partner was like \"Do what you need to do, I'm here and I'm sure that I want to be with you, so if you need to take some space then do it\", and we're just kind of playing around with that idea and we came up with this song.\u201d\n\n* It's also possible that *That's When* was written later (but before September 2005) and they wrote *Long Time Going* and *Welcome Distraction* first.\n\n**Late 2005:** Taylor writes *Don't You* with Tommy Lee James and *You All Over Me* with Scooter Carusoe. Likely *Thirteen Blocks* and *Pretty Words* come out from the writing session with Carusoe. Sony/ATV has never reclaimed property on them like they did with other songs (like *That's When*), so they were likley written after Taylor signed with Big Machine that September.\n\n* [Alexa Skill for Taylor's Version] \u201cThe song *You All Over Me* is one that I wrote with a writer who goes by the name Scooter Carusoe, his name is Travis Hill. This was one of the songs that I remember us painstakingly going over the lyrics and trying to come up with all these different symbolic imagery references to how it could feel after you have your heart broken, just to feel like you've been ruined by the whole thing and I think that's one of the hardest things about heartbreak, this feeling like it's damaged you and now you carry that damage with you.\u201d\n\n* The orginal 2005 recording of *You All Over Me* leaked in 2017.\n\n* [Alexa Skill for Taylor's Version] \u201c*Don't You* is a song that I wrote with Tommy Lee James, who's a fantastic writer. We wrote it about the idea of seeing someone that you used to have a thing for and seeing them out in public for the first time after you've heard that they've moved on and that you know your life is your life is kind of in shambles and they have moved on and they're really happy and it's almost like even them being nice to you hurts you because you're in such a state of pain and you haven't moved on yet, so that was a really fun song to write because that's just a well spring of emotion to draw from.\u201d\n\n* There are three demos of *Don't You*. Taylor only sings in a piano worktape, while other people sing in the other two. The IC owns these three demos, which they have bought from Music Row.\n\n**Somewhere in 2005:** Taylor releases a digital EP called \u201cMajorly Indie Demos\u201d. The tracklisting is incomplete and unclear but according to [SwiftFacts](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f64565b78d9cecedb45c0682eb628bfe/tumblr_n1izxk4c4g1rf0lalo1_500.png) on Tumblr, the demos of *SuperStar* and *We Were Happy* were there.\n\n* There are two demos each for *SuperStar* and *We Were Happy*, all four of them have leaked.\n\n**September 2006:** Taylor writes *Come In With The Rain*.\n\n* Come In With the Rain (acoustic) (4 min 03 sec / Acoustic)- Simply Taylor and her acoustic guitar in this early demo recording. Passionate guitar playing during the breaks between vocal parts when Taylor stops singing.\n\n* She'll later release an early mix of the song on MySpace also in September.\n\n**October 12, 2006:** [From a Lover Journal] Taylor doodles *Come In With The Rain* on her diary.\n\n**December 1, 2006:** [[Interview with CMT]](https://web.archive.org/web/20211112004035/http://www.cmt.com/news/1546980/when-she-thinks-tim-mcgraw-taylor-swift-savors-payoff/) Taylor talks about the Debut rejects that will later become some of the Fearless Vault Songs in 2021.\n\n* \u201cI've been very selfish about my songs. I had this dream of this project [Debut Album] coming out for so many years now that I just stockpiled. I'm so happy that I did because now we have a second album full of songs and a third album full of songs, and I don't have to lift a finger.\u201d\n\n**December 2006:** [From a Lover Journal] Taylor writes *White Horse*.\n\n* White Horse (3 min 36 sec / Studio) - A perfect acoustic studio version. Taylor sounds so young here, it makes us think this song was written prior to the first album. Lots of fake versions are in circulation.\n\n**December 28, 2006:** Performance at the Wildhorse Saloon in Nashville. Unknown setlist except for *Nashville* and [*Our Song.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz9A7l4KJaY&ab_channel=swiftea) Sam Armstrong was there and will comment in 2018 that Taylor performed a song about him there. It's unclear whether it was *White Horse* or *Nashville* (which is not about him, by the way).\n\n**Early 2007:** Taylor writes *The Other Side Of The Door*.\n\n* Description of *The Other Side of the Door Studio Demo* from the Inner Circle (in circulation but not leaked), which I think it's pretty accurate: \u201c4 minutes and 01 seconds: Starts with a catchy drum loop similar to the studio version of \"Permanent Marker\" and has less instrumentation. Very country with electric guitars coming in sooner.\u201d She sounds SO young in the demo, it's basically the same baby voice she has in the Christmas songs.\n\n**April 2007**: Taylor writes *You're Not Sorry*, possibily about Sam Armstrong. \n\n* [[Interview from October 2008]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz0Qrk0jjyI&ab_channel=CarameLaLa) \u201cI wrote it about maybe a year and half ago about this guy that kept apologizing and kept doing the same thing over and over again and after a while you just have stand up to that person and say, \u2018You\u2019re not sorry. At all... bye.\u2019\u201d\n* \u201cI wrote a few more songs [other than Should've Said No] on this upcoming record about him just because, you know, I wasn\u2019t done being mad about it. I know he's on the edge of his seat waiting.\n* \u201cIt is about this guy who turned out to not be who I thought I was. He came across as Prince Charming. Well, it turned out Prince Charming had a lot of secrets that he didn\u2019t tell me about. And one by one, I would figure them out. I would find out who he really was. I wrote this when I was at the breaking point of, \u2018You know what? Don\u2019t even think that you can keep on hurting me.\u2019 It was to a point where I had to walk away.\u201d\n\n**Gossip Speculation:**\n* The other songs for Sam are: *White Horse, You're Not Sorry, Come In With The Rain* and *The Other Side Of The Door*.\n\n**May 30, 2007:** [First performance of *Sparks Fly* in Oroville, CA.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4TAkirOTkk&ab_channel=andsparklydresses). Steve from the Inner Circle/Dark Blue Tennessee.com filmed it and posted it online.\n\n**Somewhere in June 2007 (not confirmed):** [From the Inner Circle] \u201cOn the Bus Solo Acoustic- Fearless (K-Bull Utah). MQ / Fearless (KMPS Seattle). MQ / Fearless (98.5 Denver). MQ. Three solo acoustic versions of Fearless played by Taylor in different cities during the middle of her first album tour. Radio contest winners were treated to these special performances on Taylor's tour bus. Some sites have mislabeled these live performances as demos of the song.\u201d\n\n* I was not able to find the months in which Taylor performed it but she was in Colorado on March 3rd and June 22nd, in Washington on March 22nd, and in Utah on June 21st. Not sure when it was though.\n\n**July 10, 2007:** [From MySpace] \u201cSo lately, I\u2019ve been in the studio on my days off recording a CHRISTMAS album! Haha. Not kidding. It\u2019s a Target exclusive thing, and I\u2019m really excited about it! There are two songs on it that I wrote. More on it later!\u201d\n\n* According to its copyright file, Christmases When You Were Mine was written in 2007, but it's totally possible that it was written around Christmas '06. In my opinion, since Nathan Chapman is credited as writer, it was likely written in the studio just for the EP.\n\n* *Christmas Must Be Something More* was written in 2003. The Acoustic Demo from 2003 has never leaked and its existence only surfaced in 2018 thanks to Bob Orrall.\n\n**July 19, 2007:** Taylor and Brad Paisley stop at the [Jamboree In The Hills](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/d62gyk/jamboree_festival_2007/) in Morristown, Ohio, where she sings [*Permanent Marker*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRbJShNcGGI&ab_channel=sara), and [*Fearless*](https://youtu.be/JMbTFu7YwAc), along other songs from Debut.\n\n**July 2007:** Taylor has written more or less 75 songs, including *Fearless*.\n \n* [[Unrated Magazine Interview]](https://web.archive.org/web/20110929103301/http://www.unratedmagazine.com/Document.cfm?Page=Articles%2Findex.cfm&Article_ID=495) \u201cI've got, like, 75 written, and we just have to whittle it down to whatever number of songs we want to put on the album, and start recording. I wrote this song that I'm really excited about called \"Fearless.\" It's about the best first date that I haven't been on yet. I just try and put myself in the position of \"this is really happening,' and what would happen on the coolest first date. So I haven't ever written a song about, you know, that feeling before. I've written songs, but I haven't recorded them or put them on an album, and so I think that would be a cool.\u201d\n\n* \u201cShe conceived the song while touring as opening act to promote her eponymous debut album: \"This is a song about the fearlessness of falling in love. No matter how many break up songs you write, no matter how many times you get hurt, you will always fall in love again. When I wrote \u201cFearless,\u201d I wasn\u2019t dating anyone. I wasn\u2019t even in the beginning stages of dating anybody. I really was all by myself out on tour and I got this idea for a song about the best first date. I think sometimes when you\u2019re writing love songs, you don\u2019t write them about what you\u2019re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had. So, this song is about the best first date I haven't had yet.\u201d\n\n* [[Hillary Lindsay to MusicRow.com]](https://musicrow.com/2015/10/the-writers-room-hillary-lindsey/) \u201cI had a writing date with Taylor, and she came to my home. She came in like a fireball. She was young, but she knew exactly what she wanted. She had been working on the song with Liz, but wanted to finish it with me.\u201d\n \n**August 2007:** Taylor writes *The Best Day* while on tour with Brad Paisley. \n\n* \u201cI wrote this song on the road and didn\u2019t tell my mom about it. I decided that I was going to keep it a secret and give it to her as a surprise for Christmas. I wrote it in the summer and then recorded it secretly with the band in the studio. After it was done, I synched the song up to all these home videos of her, and my family. She didn\u2019t even realize it was me singing until halfway through the song! She didn\u2019t have any idea that I could possibly write and record a song without her knowing about it. When she finally got it, she just started bawling her eyes out.\u201d\n\n**September 22, 2007:** \u201cI'm just counting down to December, when we start recording the next album. There's so much that I'm excited about\u201d.\n\n**August/September 2007 (not confirmed):** Tell Me Why and Acting Like A Boy, both co-written with Liz Rose, are registered together in her Music Publishing catalogue (Sony/ATV). Acting Like A Boy is the 66th song and Tell Me Why the 67th. Shortly after, a song called *Too Beautiful*, solo written, is copyrighted.\n\n* The singer told The Associated Press that this was inspired by her frustration at a boy that she liked acting up. She explained: \"I walked into Liz's house, and I said, 'I can't believe what's going on right now, I've gotta tell you about this.' I told her all about it. She goes, 'If you could say everything you were thinking to him right now, what would you start with?'\" Swift began venting: \"I would say to him, 'I'm sick and tired of your attitude, I feel like I don't even know you' ... and I just started rambling, and she was writing down everything that I was saying, and so, we turned it into a song.\"\n\n* \u201cI\u2019d been talking to a guy I\u2019ve never \u201cofficially\u201d dated. Sometimes it\u2019s the hardest thing when you have all these dreams of dating them, and you\u2019re getting close, but it doesn\u2019t work out. He would say things that would make me go, \u201cDid you just say that?\u201d It bothered me so much because he would say one thing and do another, do one thing and say another. Because he didn\u2019t know what he wanted, he would just play all these mind games. So I went over to write with Liz and was just ranting and raving about how this guy is such a flake and such a jerk sometimes, and so cool other times. I was like, \u201cLiz, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with this guy!\u201d So I just started playing the beginning, \u201cI took a chance, I took a shot. And you might think I\u2019m bulletproof, but I\u2019m not.\u201d\u201d\n\n* Description of the *Tell Me Why Acoustic Demo*: 3 minutes and 7 seconds long. An extremely rare worktape demo from the Fearless album sessions. With studio production stripped away, we are left with Taylor singing along to an acoustic guitar using vocals that are softer and carry more emotional weight. The lyrics are different in some places, which makes for fascinating comparisons.\n\n* Description of *Acting Like A Boy* (worktape): Taylor starts this demo in a unique way by stating the song title. The boy Taylor has been dating has been sending her mixed signals. He has been playing a little game, acting like he doesn't care, and picking fights with her. Taylor is not going to put up with this forever. She is going to slip through his hands soon and he won't find her anymore. This song has a very pretty chorus melody.\n\n**October 10, 2007:** [From the Inner Circle] \u201cFirst performance of Fifteen at the All For the Hall New York. Quality unknown. We do not currently have a copy of this and are not sure if it was recorded. Tickets cost $1,000 each to attend and Taylor was a surprise guest.\u201d\n\n* \u201cI wrote this around the story line of my best friend from high school, Abigail. I started everything with the line \u201cAbigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind\u201d and wrote everything else from that point, almost backwards. I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school because I felt in my freshman year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far.\u201d\n\n**October 14, 2007:** *Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection* is released in a limited edition through Target. It will be later reissued in 2009 with a slightly different cover.\n\n**November 7, 2007:** After months of putting it off, Taylor finishes Change after winning the CMA Horizon award. This will be the last time in which her fiddler Emily Poe would perfom with Taylor.\n\n* \u201cThat\u2019s when I finished it, because I knew I couldn\u2019t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion of all the people who worked so hard for me.\u201d\n\n* \u201cAt one point, I began to understand that it would be harder for me on a smaller record label to get to the places and accomplish the things that artists were accomplishing on bigger record labels. I realized that I wouldn\u2019t get favors pulled for me because there weren\u2019t any other artists on the label to pull favors from. It was going to be an uphill climb and all that I had to encourage me was the hope that someday things would change. That things would be different. After so many times of just saying that to myself over and over, I finally wrote it down in a song.\u201d\n\n**November 10, 2007:** Taylor meets up with Colbie Caillat and they write *Breathe*, for her former fiddle player, Emily Poe.\n\n* \u201cShe was doing a show in Nashville and I just happened to be in town, so we got together and wrote a killer song. It\u2019s really cool, and I can\u2019t wait for you to hear it. She\u2019s gonna record back up vocals on it for my new album. (They\u2019ll be really loud back up vocals, because she has an incredibly awesome voice and I want it to be turned wayyyy up).\u201d\n\n* [Alexa Skill for Taylor's Version] \u201cBreathe is a song about having to let go of someone in your life who you care about and you don't want to hurt but you've outgrown the friendship or the relationship and I wrote this one I wrote the idea for it and Colbie Caillat was in town playing a show and I brought her this idea and she really liked it and we wrote it together, we sat there and wrote the song right before her show, I mean it was the afternoon she was about to play that night. She's singing backup vocals on it that are just so haunting and I'm so lucky because she agreed to do the same backup vocals on my version of Breathe, so it absolutely would not have been the same without her.\u201d\n\n* \u201cIt\u2019s a song about having to say goodbye to somebody, but it never blames anybody. Sometimes that\u2019s the most difficult part. When it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault. I was a huge fan of Colbie\u2019s record. When it came out, I fell in love with the way that she makes music. I contacted her management right away and I asked if I could write with her and, sure enough, Colbie had a date coming up in Nashville where she was going to be playing a show and she had the day off. I think she sounds beautiful on it. I\u2019m so excited to have her voice on my album.\u201d\n\n**December 5, 2007:** [From MySpace] \u201cSpeaking of my next album, today was my first day in the studio \u201cpre-planning\u201d for recording it!! My producer, Nathan, and I basically spent all day listening to songs and picking which ones to record first.\u201d\n\n* \u201cWhen Taylor sat down in December 2007 to start planning her sophomore album, she knew she had a tough act to follow \u2014 her self-titled debut had just been certified double platinum. \u201cPressure is one of my favorite things in the world,\u201d Taylor told the Tennessean. \u201cWhen I heard before my second album, \u2018Is she going to experience a sophomore slump?\u2019 it made me more motivated to make sure that didn\u2019t happen. \u2018Is she going to keep this fan base?\u2019 \u2018Is this thing going to run off the tracks?\u2019 Those things motivate me. My gut instinct has worked so far, and I\u2019m not going to mess with that.\u201d\u201d\n\n**December 10, 2007:** Taylor is in the studio to record [*Change*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnr1fay4eBs&ab_channel=TaylorMusic) and [Breathe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDnuAcZaQDU). *Taylor Swift* goes double platinum. *Our Song* reaches No. 1. It's her first song to do so.\n\n**December 13, 2007:** Taylor turns 18. Footage from her birthday party will be later turned in the *Beautiful Eyes* music video.\n\n* [From MySpace] \u201cI had an amazing time at my party. I wore a hot pink dress. Pictures soon! The party was a blast.. My favorite thing about it was this photo booth. All of us were taking pictures in there the whole night. We had tarot card readers and palm readers and all kinds of fun stuff to do. I\u2019ve never really had a big birthday party before, so it was amazing to get that chance! My record label surprised me with this HUGE pink truck!! They\u2019re so sweet to me, and I\u2019ve always wanted a truck.\u201d\n\n* Around this time, an alternate version of *Christmases When You Were Mine* is released thorough [Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/article/2007/12/18/first-listen-taylor-swift/).\n\n**December 23, 2007:** [From MySpace] \u201cWe\u2019ve got six songs recorded already, and they sound amazing. I\u2019ve been in the studio with Nathan (my producer. Same guy who produced my first record! But this time we\u2019re co-producing) all month and it\u2019s been so much fun.\u201d\n\n**December 27, 2007:** [The Mirror tracklisting](https://taylor.boards.net/thread/3063/taylors-room) is released:\n\n1. Permanent Marker \n2. Tell Me Why \n3. I'd Lie \n4. Fearless \n5. Dark Blue Tennessee \n6. Sparks Fly \n7. The One Thing. \n\nLyrics to *I'm Looking Out For You* are also photographed. This song is speculated to be about Gracie Johnson, a friend of Taylor's who was battling cancer.\n\n* \u201cBye Bye Baby [previously known as The One Thing] is a song that I wrote with Liz Rose and it was just one of those ones that it would always get stuck in my head, just the idea that you're facing disappointment when it comes to somebody that you really cared about, and kind of that grand letdown that happens when you're growing up and you're learning to trust people and trying to learn about love and everything and kind of realizing that you have to let go.\u201d\n\n**Somewhere in 2007:** Taylor writes *The Way I Loved You* with John Rich.\n\n* \u201cI got this idea for a song about being in a relationship with a nice guy who is punctual and opens up the door for you and brings you flowers... but you feel nothing. The whole time you\u2019re with him, you\u2019re thinking about the guy who was complicated and messy and frustrating. So I brought that idea, the title and where I thought the song should go to John. He was able to relate to it because he is that complicated, frustrating messy guy in his relationships. We came at the song from different angles. It was just so cool to get in a room and write with him because he really is an incredible writer.\u201d\n\n* John Rich is a Republican and [spoke against Taylor in 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L61mLwdq6L4&ab_channel=Tennessean) after Marsha Blackburn won, so this is probably all we'll ever know about their writing session.\n\n**January 28, 2008:** Matt Jenkins [opens for Taylor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTgjsWHVyMA&ab_channel=mattjenkinsmusic) at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center. They write a song together called *This One's Different*. It was probably intended for Jenkins' debut album (which was never released) but I'll inlcude it anyway.\n\n* [Description of the song from the Inner Circle] The singer reflects back on how there can be really bad days and nights where it seems like everything goes wrong. But things can change for the better in a single moment when we meet the perfect person. The story in this song culminates in a romantic proposal and wedding. This song is unique because Taylor only sings background vocals and the story is told from the boy's perspective.\n\n* [Video of Taylor and Matt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovUoEPORgv4&ab_channel=mattjenkinsmusic) explaining how she contacted him.\n\n**February 28, 2008:** Love and Theft open Taylor's concert in Spartanburg, SC. This is likely the period when Taylor and Stephen Barker Liles met and Taylor wrote Hey Stephen.\n\n* \u201cWe were recording at John and Martina McBride\u2019s studio [NdR: Blackbird Studios in Nashville] and he was like, \u2018My kids are dying to meet you. Do you think that you could say hi to them?\u2019 I said, \u2018Sure, have them come and hang out while we\u2019re recording.\u2019 So his daughters and their friends from school \u2013 there were about ten of them there \u2013 they all came into the studio when we were recording \u201cHey Stephen\u201d and they loved it. They were singing along with it by the end of it.\" The children ended up snapping their fingers on the song.\u201d\n\n**March 2008:** According to ProAudio Review Magazine, *Love Story* was recorded in March.\n\n* [From *Everyday is a Fairytale* by Liv Spencer] \u201cTaylor wrote this song lying on her bedroom floor in a mere 20 minutes and recorded a rough cut of the track in 15 minutes of studio time the next day.\u201d\n\n* [[Nathan Chapman to ProAudio]](https://web.archive.org/web/20101219201559/http://proaudioreview.com/article/21158) \u201cThe vocal was a tracking vocal \u2014 that's the vocal she cut live with the band,\" Chapman reveals. \"The band was just acoustic guitar, bass and drums; everything else was overdubbed.\u201d\n\n* Nathan is likely talking about these two demos: **Love Story (4 min 8 sec / Acoustic in a Studio)** Taylor went into the studio to record this demo shortly after writing it and you can hear Nathan (the producer) speaking during the recording; **Love Story Justin Niebank Master Mix (3 min 58 sec / Studio)** - As the music starts playing, Taylor clears her throat in preparation for singing. This album demo is more like a raw unmixed studio version. Sometimes Taylor's vocal is simply one take with no enhancements. At other times, harmonies are mixed in loudly or there are multiple Taylor vocals all singing together.\n\n* [[Taylor on Rolling Stone, January 25, 2010]](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylors-time-catching-up-with-taylor-swift-101783/) \u201cLove Story wasn\u2019t technically the last one, but it was very, very last minute.\u201d \n\n* \u201cThis is a song I wrote when I was dating a guy who wasn't exactly the popular choice. His situation was a little complicated, but I didn't care. I started this song with the line \"This love is difficult, but it's real.\" When I wrote the ending to this song, I felt like it was the ending every girl wants to go with her love story. It\u2019s the ending that I want. You want a guy who doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks, what anyone says. He just says, \u201cMarry me, Juliet, I love you, and that\u2019s all I really know.\u201d It\u2019s sort of told in a character kind of thing, where it\u2019s Romeo and Juliet, and it\u2019s not me saying that I\u2019m getting married or anything...but I think it\u2019s fun to write about it.\u201d\n\n**March 2008:** Just days after writing *Love Story*, Taylor has a writing session with Craig Wiseman. She brings *Love Story* with her, asking if he wanted to finish it with her, but he refused. They end up writing another unknown song.\n\n**March 28, 2008:** [[Rollling Stone Interview]](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/the-billboard-qa-taylor-swift-1046063/) \u201cI\u2019ve recorded six songs, including one that I wrote with Colbie Caillat, that she\u2019s going to throw some harmonies on, which I can\u2019t even wait to hear. And I\u2019m going in to record six more this week and then we have another session scheduled for summertime. We\u2019re really trying to just cut a bunch of stuff and put whatever is best on the album.\u201d\n\n**Early June 2008:** Taylor records *Crazier* and *White Horse*.\n\n* \u201cI actually wasn\u2019t going to put this song on the album. I was going to wait for the third album because I really felt like we had the \u201csadness\u201d represented on this record. Then my agency out in LA set up a meeting with executive producers Betsy Beers and Shonda Rhimes at Grey\u2019s Anatomy because that\u2019s my favorite show. It would just be a dream come true to have a song on it. So, I played them \u201cWhite Horse.\u201d It was just me and my guitar and they freaked out. They loved it. They said, \u201cWe\u2019ll get back to you as soon as possible.\u201d For a while, we didn\u2019t know if we were going to put it on the record because if it wasn\u2019t going to be on the show, then we weren\u2019t going to put it on the album. Then they called and said they were very interested in the song. We recorded it right away, sent it off to them, and they put it in!\u201d\n\n* \u201cTo me, White Horse is about what, in my opinion, is the most heart-breaking part of a break-up \u2013 that moment when you realize that all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears. Everything after that moment is moving on.. But that initial moment of \"Wow, it's over\" is what I wrote White Horse about.\u201d\n\n* [Billboard Interview, March 2008] There are songs that I wrote when I was 13 that I think are perfect to bring out now. I didn\u2019t get a chance to put \u2019em on the record the first time around. There\u2019s so much stuff that I\u2019m gonna to pull from the back drawer and then there\u2019s some stuff that I will write today and cut tomorrow.\n\n**Speculation:**\n\n* I'm pretty confident that the songs written at 13 which she considered to release were *Crazier* and *R-E-V-E-N-G-E*.\n\n* I'm not entirely sure it was June, but Crazier, White Horse and Beautiful Eyes were mastered together, so I'm gonna assume it was a period between her cameo in Hannah Montana and the release of the Beautiful Eyes EP. Grey's Anatomy was in post-production in that period, so that checks out.\n\n**June 9, 2008:** Taylor shoots her cameo in Hannah Montana.\n\n**June 29, 2008:** First live perfomance of [*Untouchable*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5_xt0yBEY&ab_channel=E.M.F.Productions) from the *Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008*.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** *Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008* is the album which was released without Taylor's approval in April 2020. Before the \"official\" Big Machine release, these songs were on the Target YouTube channel. YouTube channel EAS Music Official waited until Taylor regained possessions of Fearless before uploading a 4K remastered version of [*Love Story*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvqU4aJ3QHM&ab_channel=EASMusicOfficial) from this live. Both videos are ethical-sourced.\n\n**July 15, 2008:** *Beautiful Eyes* is released.\n\n* [From MySpace] \u201cI\u2019m only letting my record company make a small amount of these - the last thing I want any of you to think is that we are putting out too many releases. I\u2019m not going to be doing a bunch of promotion for it, because I don\u2019t want there to be confusion about whether it\u2019s the second album or not.\u201d\n\n* Beautiful Eyes was written by April 20, 2004 and recorded on August 9, 2004 and it was produced by Orrall. The song released is actually the exact same demo, not even remixed, just mastered. [Source: Bob Orrall's Instagram]\n\n* I Heart? was written in early 2004 and the demo recorded in June 2004. The released version, available for download if you bought her Debut album the first week at Best Buy, was recorded on November 3, 2005 (instrumentals) and on November 4, 2005 (vocals). Both versions are produced by Orrall.\n\n**FAQ: [What's the difference between mixing and mastering?](https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/what-is-mastering.html#02)**\n\n**August 5 and 6, 2008:** Shooting of the *Love Story* music video at the Cumberland University and Castle Gwynn in Arrington, Tennessee.\n\n**August 8, 2008:** *Change* is released.\n\n**August 15, 2008:** Week of the Jonas Brothers 3D Movie shooting where Taylor performs Should've Said No; Should've Said No reaches No. 1; Fearless is announced for November.\n\n**August 30, 2008:** [From MySpace] \u201cSo now is the time for planning. In 73 days, November 11th will be here and so will the release date of my new album. And so right now I\u2019m in the middle of writing my \u2018thank you\u2019 section and thinking about track listing order (wondering \u201cWhat song should go first..? Or last? How do you get the perfect flow of an album? What IS the \"flow\u201d of an album? Hmmm..\u201c). And I\u2019m also thinking about the secret codes to put into the lyrics. [...] This next record is on my mind 24/7, all the time. It never stops. I\u2019m always either listening to a new mix of a song or scanning through pictures to make sure we\u2019ve chosen the right ones, or wondering which songs you guys are going to like the best. I\u2019m just so obsessed with it right now, all the planning. And sometimes I just have to sit back and remind myself that 73 days is not going to be here any sooner if I obsess. It\u2019s still going to be 73 days away.\u201d\n\n**Somewhere between July and August 2008:** Taylor writes *Jump Then Fall* and *Today Was A Fairytale*.\n\n**Somewhere in 2008:** \u201cI came into the writing session with Liz Rose and said: \u201cI\u2019ve got this idea. I had overheard a friend of mine talking to his girlfriend and he was completely on the defensive saying, \u201cNo, baby...I had to get off the phone really quickly...I tried to call you right back...Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She was just yelling at him! I felt so bad for him at that moment. So I came up with the first line \u201cYou\u2019re on the phone with your girlfriend, she\u2019s upset, going off about something that you said,\u201d and I ran that into the story line that I\u2019m in love with him and he should be with me instead of her. It just became this whole picture. It was really fun for us to write the line, \u201cShe wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts.\u201d\u201d\n\n* You Belong With Me (3 min 7 sec / Acoustic)- Provides an incredible window into the songwriting process which went into this future hit song. Taylor clears her voice and then unleashes her acoustic guitar as she sings along with great feeling. There are some unique lyrics on this demo including an entirely different bridge. Simply stunning.\n\n**September 12, 2008:** The lead single *Love Story* is released. \n\n* [From MySpace] \u201cA lot of people have been asking me what inspired this song.. I think the line that sums up what that song is about is \u201cThis love is difficult, but it\u2019s real.\u201d It just means that sometimes you have to fight for love, but sometimes it\u2019s worth fighting for. Like with Romeo and Juliet. Except without the death. :) To me, the song isn\u2019t really about living in a castle and having met your true love at a royal ball. It\u2019s simpler than that. It\u2019s about love being worth it. The hard times, the things that keep you apart, the times when you question it.. I would really like to think that the right love is worth the energy we put into it. So that\u2019s what this song is about. Love and Romeo, and how we fight for those things that we can\u2019t be without. In 1789 or in 2008. Whether you\u2019re 16 or 60.\u201d\n\n* Taylor will call the guy who inspired Love Story \u201ca creep\u201d in a [2011 interview.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPMxkD4W_v4&ab_channel=TaylorSwiftSerbia)\n\n**September 18, 2008:** The Jonas Brothers are filming their [music video Lovebug](https://www.justjared.com/2008/09/18/jonas-brothers-love-bug-music-video/). Joe meets Camilla Belle there.\n\n**September 22, 2008:** [From MySpace] [...] And I recorded a new song [Forever & Always] the other day for Fearless. I think it\u2019s fun to put yourself under crazy pressure to finish a song by a certain deadline. That\u2019s what I did with this last song. And that makes 13 songs on the new album. 13\u2026.. I think that\u2019s a good number of songs to end up with\u2026.<3\n\n* \u201cForever & Always is about when I was in a relationship with someone and I was just watching him slowly slip away. I didn't know why, because I wasn't doing anything different. I didn't do anything wrong. He was just fading. It\u2019s about the confusion and frustration of wondering why? What changed? When did it change? What did I do wrong? In this case, the guy I wrote it about ended up breaking up with me for another girl. Guess I know why he was fading.\u201d\n\n**September 26, 2008:** *White Horse* is premeried on Grey's Anatomy.\n\n**September 30, 2008:** [From MySpace] \u201cSo this week, we\u2019re in \u201cfinal approval mode\u201d for the album. You know, all the emails that say in the subject lines \u201cFearless album booklet: FINAL APPROVAL\u201d or \u201cCD design: FINAL APPROVAL\u201d. So I\u2019m doing a lot of approving. And then they send it to the magical CD maker people and they make all the CDs just in time for November 11. Actually, it\u2019s called the distribution branch, but I prefer \u201cthe magical CD maker people\u201d.\u201d\n\n**Somewhere during the last two weeks of September:** *Drama Queen*, co-written with Martin Johnson is written and recorded. It will be mastered along the rest of the Fearless songs and another re-recording of *R-E-V-E-N-G-E* (not the one leaked). Since the song was mastered, it's considered an outtake and not a demo.\n\n* Fun fact: Along with *I'd Lie*, *Drama Queen* and *R-E-V-E-N-G-E* are the only three unreleased songs to have been mastered.\n\n**IMPORTANT PERSONAL NOTE:** I know that a lot of people think that Drama Queen is exclusively a Speak Now cut, but this is not my opinion, but what the master engineer (Hank Williams) and Big Machine officially declared. Feel free to not believe them though. It's totally possible it was considered for Fearless Platinum or for Speak Now (and I believe it was) but cut in favour of Better Than Revenge, but it doesn't change the fact that it's also a Fearless cut. If you really have proof that Big Machine falsified documents, call them out, don't waste time coming after me, I just copy-past stuff. They're already considered liars anyway.\n\n**October 14, 2008:** Through *Countdown to Fearless*, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store, *Fearless* is released as a promotional single.\n\n**October 28, 2008:** *You're Not Sorry* is released as a promotional single through ITunes.\n\n**November 4, 2008:** *You Belong With Me* is released as a promotional single through ITunes.\n\n**November 11, 2008:** *Fearless* is finally released.\n\n**March 19, 2009 (not confirmed):** [From MySpace] \u201cI've been in the studio all day (I know, I know.. We JUST put out a new album. I think I have a problem, I cannot stop writing songs.)\u201d. The song is possibly *Mr. Perfectly Fine*.\n\n* [Alexa Skill for Taylor's Version] \u201cMr Perfectly Fine was definitely an early indicator of me sort of creeping towards a pop sensibility. I've always listened to every type of music and even though Fearless is a country album, there were always these pop melodies creeping in. But I really love this song and, I love the bridge, I think the lyrics are just wonderfully scathing and full of the teen angst that you would hope to hear on an album that I wrote when I was 17 or 18 or you know on that cusp.\u201d\n\n**April 23, 2009:** The Fearless Tour starts in Evansville, Indiana.\n\n**October 26, 2009:** *Fearless Platinum Edition* is released.\n\n\nThank you for reading this very long post.

If you're already eating plant based but going to start warfarin then just don't change your intake of leafy greens or other vitamin K sources too much.\n\nIt's also important to note that the newer oral blood thinners like apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban don't work the same way as warfarin so you don't need to keep an eye on your vitamin K intake.",

I was a teenager at the time so my emotions probably weren't helped by the time of my life I was in but I don't blame my parents - they were doing the best they could having two kids who needed significant support. \n\nAt the same time though I don't see the point of brushing it off just because the sibling would have had it just as bad and quite probably worse. Again, if there are people actually trying to frame it as a competition then my point doesn't stand but I think it can help a lot of people who've dealt with feelings like this.",

However, this morning some friends who were also invited got a text telling them they had been at a COVID exposure site, to get tested ASAP and to isolate until they return a negative result. About half of them are following this advice and so are not going because they haven't got their results yet, but some of them have decided to go anyway without bothering to get tested and the host has said he's ok with this.\n\nA little while ago in a group chat someone asked if I was going and I told them the truth - that I no longer felt comfortable because I knew there would be people there who had been exposed but were not isolating and hence did not know if they were positive or not. Thankfully a lot of my friends were understanding as they all know that I have health issues but one particular friend went off saying that I was being \"ridiculous\" and that I was \"letting COVID ruin my life.\" I didn't give in, but I'm sure this isn't an uncommon experience unfortunately :("

Figured I\u2019d share my story so fare. \n\nThis all started at the beginning of May, I\u2019m convinced it was triggered by my best friends mum passing (I\u2019ve known her since I was 5; I\u2019m 28 now, 27 when this began). My feet started going numb five days after and then a few days later, I was running the checkouts at work and it went up my legs. Felt like someone was blowing up a balloon around my pelvis. My doctor signed me off for 2 weeks (later turned into a month) because my white cell count was high, that makes sense now. During that time, it settled down in my legs and started moving around my body, half my face was numb. \n\nThe entire month off, I had double vision and when I went back to work, my eye started wandering and getting worse throughout the shift and again, I didn\u2019t freak out. I actually had fun with it, ngl. It was fun freaking out my colleagues. My mum was amused because I would freak out over anything when I wasn\u2019t feeling well as a child.\n\nFour days after that, I\u2019d had my first Covid-19 jab and the next day I was sent home with a headache (if that was a side effect of the jab, I didn\u2019t notice after that first flare) and I went to sleep. A few hours after I woke up, I realised I could actually see what I was typing. The jab fixed my eye! Immune system must have noticed something new and went to fixing everything.\n\nI mentioned MS from that very first appointment. I haven\u2019t really had a period of adjustment or anything because I just knew it was MS. I was just reading about it once and came across something called Lhermitte\u2019s Sign, which I had and didn\u2019t even look it up and that basically confirmed it for me. Lupus was also on the table since my mum has it but my paternal half brother has MS so I won a lottery of autoimmune conditions in my family \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nWhat prompted my covering GP to refer me to neurology was a visit I made years ago that I don\u2019t even remember doing about a numb spot on my thigh and I\u2019m so glad I did. Shortened my diagnosis from potential years to 6 months. I\u2019ve been telling people since, matter how small or insignificant you think it is, tell your doctor!\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you so much for reading \ud83d\ude0a just wanted to share my story"

I was worried when I missed a couple of calls but he wanted to talk and get in contact because our side of the family is just really bad at that. I always knew about my two cousins (his brother F) and my half siblings but they were always comfortably there in the background, living their lives. I don\u2019t want to bother them but I\u2019m happy if they reach out and I\u2019m very glad my cousin did. \n\nOverall it was a really good conversation and I\u2019m glad to have had it. We talked about a possible reunion and joked a lot. He was really shocked though that I wasn\u2019t told about his brother\u2019s death last year. It made the news, it wasn\u2019t pretty.\n\nI didn\u2019t know F, but it\u2019s still made me sad I think because now I\u2019ll never know him. In my mind, they were always there, living their life but that\u2019s changed now. It\u2019s been on my mind ever since but also the excitement of being in contact with my cousin again."

Then, I started to really like it when exceptions from the teaser and FMR were put aside.\n\nWhat I love the most about this comeback was that while the title track is very hype and red. The B-side were smooth, velvety and very garage/ground sound. I love how the sounds are so different, yet they delicately fit and suit one another.\n\nBirthday sounds like an NCT or Aespa song yet with Red Velvet style and sound. The b-sides I can't explain other that they sound Red Velvet. FMR Mini Album sounded mature and classy (as the concept was. C:) while Birthday mini sounded mature yet street and hip hop and garage.\n\nI was excepting something like f(x) Pink Tape or Red Velvet Ice Cream Cake. Yet it was something completely else, yet still beautiful all the same. My only complaint is that I wish there were more songs. I can't help but wonder how they would sound if the concept had at least 2 more songs or being made into a full album.\n\nIn conclusion: this album officially sealed the deal for me as a Wendy simp. She didn't have to go that hard, yet she did, and she slayed."

My side profile looks awful on it, my chin and nose look huge and asymmetrical, my hairline is terrible because back then I had my hair dyed in dark brown but my blonde roots were showing so I literally look like I\u2019m balding\u2026 My face looks so masculine on that picture, I wanted to die from embarrassment that she posted that picture without telling me. I texted her in private and I had to open up about this insecurity of mine that I barely talk to anybody about and thank god she deleted it\u2026 but it\u2019s still stuck in my mind and it plays a lot with my confidence.

J\u2019ai eu quelques jobs \u00e9tudiantes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant et lorsque je me cherche un travail, je finis par me trouver un emploi assez rapidement (en m\u00eame temps, avec la p\u00e9nurie de main d\u2019\u0153uvre, ce n\u2019est pas bien compliqu\u00e9). Lorsque je donne mon CV, ce n\u2019est pas long que je re\u00e7ois un coup de fil et qu\u2019on me demande en entrevue. Sinon, on me dit d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but qu\u2019ils ne cherchent pas d\u2019employ\u00e9s mais qu\u2019il consid\u00e8re tout de m\u00eame le CV que je leur donne, donc au moins je sais \u00e0 quoi m\u2019attendre et je ne perds pas mon temps.\n\nCeci \u00e9tant dit, j\u2019ai d\u2019autres amis qui sont blancs et qui vivent la m\u00eame r\u00e9alit\u00e9 que moi lorsqu\u2019ils se cherchent un travail. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 est-ce que \u00e7a diff\u00e8re, c\u2019est mes amis de d\u2019autres ethnies lorsqu\u2019ils se cherchent un travail, mais qui sont dans la m\u00eame situation que moi (aux \u00e9tudes).\n\nJ\u2019ai un ami d\u2019origine marocaine, avec un nom marocain assez classique, qui a un CV tr\u00e8s propre, qui a plein d\u2019heures \u00e0 donner puisqu\u2019il a peu de cours au c\u00e9gep et qui a un permis de conduire, qui a fait le PEI au secondaire, etc. Pourtant, il a envoy\u00e9 tellement de CV dans sa ville et les environs qu\u2019il ne pourrait m\u00eame pas les compter, et il n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucun retour d\u2019appel. M\u00eame pas une entrevue. Personne n\u2019a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 sa candidature. Cela fait depuis l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier qu\u2019il cherche un emploi.\n\nUne autre amie, d\u2019origine hispanique, vit le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me. Depuis les 3-4 derniers mois, sans blague, elle a envoy\u00e9 presque 100 CV aux environs d\u2019o\u00f9 elle vit. Elle a pu d\u00e9crocher seulement deux entrevues dont une qui a fini en refus sans aucune raison cit\u00e9e par l\u2019employeur et l\u2019autre qui s\u2019av\u00e9rait \u00eatre une place tr\u00e8s louche (ils l\u2019aurait fait travailler gratuitement). Sinon, c\u2019est un refus imm\u00e9diat de son CV en ligne ou simplement jamais de r\u00e9ponse, m\u00eame si elle se pr\u00e9sente physiquement \u00e0 l\u2019endroit souhait\u00e9.\n\nBref, est-ce que c\u2019est vraiment une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 chez les qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois non blancs? Est-ce que c\u2019est aussi difficile de se trouver un emploi pour vous? Rendue o\u00f9 j\u2019en suis, je ne crois plus \u00e0 la co\u00efncidence. Les exemples que j\u2019ai donn\u00e9 sont deux parmi tant d\u2019autres. J\u2019aimerais conna\u00eetre votre exp\u00e9rience."

I see how 99% of the body positivity movement is geared towards women, whereas it's a fact that men have body insecurity issues on the same level as women, if not more. Women are blunt and brutal about how tall they want their men to be; but when men want to decide whether they want to date fat or dark skinned women or not, women get hurt. There are abundant men who have no issues going for fat women, but how many women are willing to date or marry men shorter than them? A miniscule minority. We have heard about men having a thing for fat, plumpy, or obese women. But have you ever seen a woman saying \"I have a thing for men who're shorter than me\"? Nope! \n\nWomen are obsessed about men's height, but have the audacity to ask \"why are men so obsessed about boobs?\" Tumhara preference preference, humaara preference mysoginy? Hypocrisy ki bhi seema hoti hai.\n\nCall me an incel and a mysoginist, but in reality, you are a chauvinist. Because anyone who cannot take criticism and acknowledge the wrongs of their own gender, shows clear signs of chauvinism. And all my life I've learnt that most women abhore criticisms against their gender. Men and women are the two sides of the same rusted coin. If you think that only men are sexist? No, my friends, women are as sexist, self-entitled, and egotistical as men are.",

And f*** I fell hard for them. I\u2018ve never been in love with anyone before. And I was perceiving mixed signals. And it turned out, they weren\u2018t mixed at all. When I confessed my feelings to them I even reached the point where I was thinking: \u201eyou know what? The worst thing that can happen is that they don\u2018t reciprocate my romantic feelings. But that\u2018s perfectly fine. At least we can still stay friends - I\u2018ll somehow get over it after some time.\u201c\n\nGuess what happened\u2026.. they perceived my confession as a giant betrayal and after having avoided me like the flu in the aftermath for a few weeks they just threw the whole friendship away, when I wanted to have an in-person-conversation about this situation. They ended it like it\u2018s nothing. Like they had already mentally ended it in the same second as I confessed to them. I can\u2018t put into words how much this hurt.\n\nThey blocked me on wa and unfollowed my socials. And I, like the sobbing mess I was, promised them that I would never cut them off, even if they decided to cut me off. I wanted to be loyal. I wanted to make the best out of it. So I didn\u2018t unfollow them (and they didn\u2018t delete me from their list) and I didn\u2018t block them. Man, I even still liked their posts. My inner talk was: \u201eI\u2018ll show you that I\u2018ve never betrayed you by never backing off\u201c. IG in the end I\u2019ve only hurt myself with this mindset.\n\nHowever, two months ago, I realized that they had unblocked me on wa. And after this, a few weeks ago, I\u2018ve received a follower request from them. They immediately watched my story when I accepted it. And they did not reach out.\n\nWell, I don\u2018t intend reaching out to them neither. But them not reaching out to me makes me feel like I\u2019m slowly going crazy. We always like similar stuff on insta, so their name is in my feed all the time.\n\nI belive that they\u2018ve moved on from our friendship months ago. They probably weren\u2018t thinking one thing while pressing the \u201efollow\u201c button in my profile. It hurts so much. \n\nI don\u2018t want to waste another year waiting for them to come back. But I also don\u2018t want to unfollow them. But following them hurts. But so does unfollowing. No matter what I think about doing - if feels wrong. And I\u2018m still hoping. And I\u2018m still remembering. They\u2018re all the fxing time on my mind. I just don\u2019t get it. Am I a creep? Stupid? Weak? What\u2018s wrong with me?"

He would e.g. say smth among the lines: \u201cA client of mine, who is also shy and somewhat like you, told me nothing about their childhood in the first few sessions. So after a while I told him what I thought what his childhood was like. And he stated that everything was correct\u201d or he would e.g. tell me that he had a client who stated that they had BPD even though they clearly hadn\u2019t & that he couldn\u2019t understand why some people nowadays thought they actually wanted to have BPD. Etc.\n\nWe would also sometimes talk about superficial things like books or authors or movies but these conversations stay superficial until one of us changes the topic.\n\nI feel like most of the things he tells me are at least somewhat connected to either the things we discuss in therapy or to me as a person - but since it\u2019s somehow become more usual and he sometimes uses quite a bit of time to tell me these things it often feels a bit\u2026 awkward? I mean it\u2019s not really that I\u2019m not curious about these things and they sometimes make me laugh too but uh.. I remember that I wanted to say something in our last session but (surely unintentionally) got \u201covertalked\u201d by him. Not sure how to phrase it - he\u2019s probably trying to make me feel more relaxed? On the one hand I\u2019m glad he\u2019s being so casual but at the same time I fear(?) that it might get TOO casual..? idk. (Even though I\u2019m already more than a year in therapy)\n\nWhat do you think about this? Do your therapists tell stories or anecdotes?"

I know someone managed to find out that Phoenix was born on Oct. 11, but looking at Larry's age/birth year makes sense for him to be a winter baby. Since Larry was born in 1993, and is younger than Phoenix and Miles, I don't think he would've skipped a grade (because he's notorious for being very stupid.)\n\nThe only logical explanation is that he was born early in 1993 and just got rounded up a school year before the grade cutoff. So, Larry is most likely a January kid and shares a birth month with me. I don't know what to do with this information.\n\nEdit: Another strong piece of evidence that shows he's probably a January kid is that between The First Turnabout (August) and Turnabout Goodbyes, (End of December,) Larry is still listed as being 23 and still hasn't hit 24 yet. Lining this up with his birth year, it seems that Larry is 100% born in January of 1993."

But I noticed that, despite yall's great knowledge and logical theories on this topic, many of y'all did not notice something about all of this. let me explain.\n\nMany people prefer to say that the person who erected the guidstones has a depopulation plan, right? Most of us assumed that that person, whoever they are, is a part of the elites or something. BUT what if he (the person who erected the guidstones) was someone who was trynna help the rest of the population in the future? And what I mean of \"the rest of the population\" is that maybe in the future, and maybe in the near future we never know, a global catastrophe will happen and will cause the population to be decreased to LESS THAN 500M. So, obviously now that person was speaking to the rest of us who will still be alive after the catastrophe. AND THAT'S WHY it was engraved that people should be aware of the population and reproduce wisely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe it's not a depopulation plan, but a guide for the rest who'll stay alive. I don't mean to cause a panic at all. It's just a thoery of mine, I don't know if someone thought the same the thing, but just wanted to share."

I've only ever used blacking stuff on steel for coloring. I was wondering if theres a way to get vibrant colors to stay on without something like paint. Only other stuff I can find is patina but I'm not sure if its what exactly I'm looking for. The current color I'm trying to achieve is like a yellowish orange but its pretty bright."

I wasn't even on it that long, but my mom said to hurry up. I left the washroom, phone hidden in a pocket. No way of her finding out. And yet, she told me that I shouldn't be on my phone in the washroom. I lied and denied it, but she said yes you were. I know everything. It might be because she has ways of accessing my phone activity, but there's more.\n\nThis morning, I turned on the shower and waited for it to heat up. Door locked again. My mom told me to get in the shower already. *How does she know??*\n\nAnd then there are the small signs. First, I sense a little change in her voice. It's not very noticeable, but it sounds very psychopathic and controlling and makes me feel scared. Second, she's suddenly stopped \"coincidentally\" needing to grab something from the washroom when I'm in there, or trying to shower with me. She makes comments on my body saying how I'm curvy or my breasts are big, and my dad touches me weird.\n\nHow do I know what to look for? I'm waiting for her to leave the house so I can search the washroom for a camera. I'll take any photos of it that I can. I plan on calling CPS as this is my last straw and not the only abuse I've experienced from she and my dad. I'm just waiting for my dad to come back from Egypt so that I can get rid of them both.  I'm kind of shocked. I'm scared. Not of her, but of my future. What's going to happen when I do call CPS? What if they leave me with my parents and then my parents know about it and get even worse? What am I going to do once I get separated from my parents, and where's my older brother gonna go?"

I can't fucking take this anymore. I just need to dump all of this somewhere.\n\nThis summer, my mom tried to shower with me. She told me that I have to go shower with her. I told her I'm uncomfortable with that. She said no you have to I'm your mom. I said no I don't want to, I'm perfectly capable of showering on my own. She started yelling and arguing for a long time until finally she let me go. On one condition: I'd have to leave the door unlocked. I resisted, but she threatened to take away my devices and said she'd check every few minutes to see if it's locked, and that she had a key to unlock it anyway. It's not the first time that happened, it's just that she never got that bad until that time.\n\nPrior to that event, she'd constantly make comments about my body ever since I was like 9, saying that my chest is getting bigger, my hips are curvy etc... And my dad keeps on touching me weirdly on my back and shoulders too, even after I've made it clear that I'm uncomfortable with that. I can't even stand next to him anymore without feeling unsafe.\n\nWhen I was 10 or 11, I was in a Discord server, pretending to be 14. A guy in his 20s started saying things like \"I love you, I'll come to Canada just to marry you\" and being extremely overprotective and flirty and sexual towards me. I made it clear that I wasn't into him, but didn't block him because most of the others were either unfriendly or harassing me for my religion and sending me videos of (TW: extreme gore) rats being squished until their insides burst out of their asses and mouths. (end of TW) It fucking traumatized me. And the only person who stood by my side was a fucking pedophile.\n\nWhen I was 9, I was groomed by guys online into being their girlfriend because I was fucking stupid. They'd flirt with me, say sexual stuff etc... They didn't reveal their age until I revealed mine, and suspiciously, it'd always be a 1 year age gap at most. I don't know how I fell for that. I remember a guy (still online) asking me how my vagina smelled, when I was 12 (he was like 19) and me not thinking much of it.\n\nWayyy back to when I was like 4. My brother and parents would always tickle me and go on and on until I'd start crying and screaming at them to stop. Almost every single day. And my brother would blackmail me into doing anything he wants me to do by telling me that he'll tickle me if I don't. This continued until I was like 9 or 10.\n\nThe worst part is the invalidation. One person says that different cultures have different tendencies. The other says my parents loved me. Another says it's not as bad as they thought, and that other people have been through much worse. Fuck this shit. Why does it even exist? How do people so terrible even exist? What happened to humans being the smartest animal?"

Because I've denied myself support for so long. Because, in the end, I'm the only one who understands me and will ever truly pity me and support me and know how it feels.\n\nHoly shit.

I have a dysfunctional family, borderline abusive. \n\nI met this wonderful girl online, we started as friends but things quickly escalated for me. I started seeing her more than a friend after talking to her and knowing her for almost 7-8 months. I thought I'd never tell her because it might ruin the friendship. But I felt horrible pain when she started talking about the guy she met on a dating app. I felt my stomach churning, every night.   \nOne day I decided to be honest and told her. She told me that she can't deal with it (she has had guys who crept up to her place) however I told her I don't want her to reciprocate that and that I was fine with this friendship as it has been going. However she told me she'll have to block me. She did. \n\nThe first day I felt numb, couldn't feel anything. The next day I cried the whole night. It got so bad that I had to check in with a psychiatrist who put me on anti depressants. After taking them for 2 months I felt I couldn't deal with the numbness so I stoppped. It was fine for a month but now the memories are flooding in everyday and causing unbearable pain.   \nI can't tell that to my parents because to them it means that I am weak.  I have never had a parental figure in my life. Please give me something so I can believe again."

No favourites, I like almost everything (Slight bias towards punk, alternative, orchestral music and J-rock) \n\nAnime? Demon Slayer, My hero Academia, Tokyo Ghoul, Hunter x hunter. \\*have only watched 5-7 anime. \n\nCharacters? Harry Potter, Sirius, Forge and Gred ( :P), Ken Kaneki, Zenitsu, Tanjiro, Nezuko, Giyu, Todoroki, Midoriya, Gon, Killua, Arima (Tokyo Ghoul), Akira, Yomo Renji, Ayato, Hinami, Newt (Maze runner)  \n\n\nNovels? Harry Potter, Ready Player One, Dark Matter. \\*have read only 15 novels.   \n\n\nHills? No favourites here cuz I only climbed the ones near my local area and they're not famous. But the view is nice tho :) \n\nMy life's theme song- Unravel, Katharsis. \n\nPersonality- TLDR; INTP 9w1 (by behaviour) but INFP at heart.   \n\n\nLong answer- I like to think logical. I can spend days just thinking about random ideas that pop up in my head. The speed and frequency of the ideas is so fast its overwhelming most of the times. (not boasting) I'm kind and \\*VERY\\* caring when I open up to people.  \nI am a big idealist, and a non-conformist. I have a strong moral compass, which I'll follow to my death.   \nI am a big introvert with sprinkles of extrovert energy over me.   \n\n\nWho are you? Hopefully you're human (aliens are cool tho :) ). You're nice and considerate.  You want to be friends with me, possibly long term. You don't ghost people.  You'll put effort into texting, let's not either of us be the sole carrier of the conversation. You like to text first sometimes.   \n\n\nThank you senpai for reading such a long ass post."

That being said, a $50 dollar cake made by a small business is most likely gonna be smaller and will feed less people due to the better quality ingredients being more expensive and more difficult to get.",

I\u2019ve also tried fluconazole. \nAfter many studies, my urogynecologist wants to treat me with amitriptyline (an antidepressant). She says the symptoms are caused by having contracted the pelvic floor. She also wants to send me to kinesiology sessions.\nI read that doctors usually use this antidepressant to treat IC but I don't understand how the constant uti would solve.

Encontrei ontem um apartamento de fuder, bem localizado, espa\u00e7oso, com o quarto separado da cozinha (t\u00e3o comum pelas bandas de c\u00e1), pre\u00e7o divulgado no post exatamente no que eu tinha estipulado no meu or\u00e7amento, simplesmente perfeito. Eu estava planejando me mudar em dezembro apenas, pra juntar dinheiro pra cau\u00e7\u00e3o sem me estressar, mas por esse apartamento eu fiquei louca e j\u00e1 mandei mensagem.\n\nConversei com o locador, que ent\u00e3o me disse que o pre\u00e7o Y do apartamento s\u00f3 seria pra um aluguel de 2 meses porque logo depois ele iria reformar e iria aumentar pra um pouco al\u00e9m do meu or\u00e7amento, mas com as contas mensais inclusas (e nisso ficou ainda melhor porque s\u00f3 iria me mudar daqui a quatro meses, quando a reforma acabasse). Falei pra ele que tudo bem, que estava interessada mesmo assim e gostaria de ver o apartamento hoje (segunda-feira) durante o meu intervalo do trabalho. Super sol\u00edcito, ele disse que a sobrinha iria me encontrar, e assim nos despedimos.\n\nHoje, faltando uma hora e meia pra me encontrar com a sobrinha dele, ele me manda mensagem dizendo que j\u00e1 tinha alugado o apartamento pra outra pessoa. E a\u00ed quando comentei que era uma pena pois fiquei muito interessada no apartamento, ele disse que o pre\u00e7o iria aumentar depois da reforma (sendo que ele j\u00e1 tinha falado isso antes???). Perguntei quanto aumentaria, e a\u00ed o valor X que ele tinha me dado agora seria o dobro depois da reforma, sendo que ontem eu especificamente perguntei qual seria o valor depois da reforma e com as contas mensais inclusas, o que ele confirmou e deu continuidade no agendamento pra o encontro que seria hoje.\n\nEu sinto que ele largou um migu\u00e9 pra mim, me fez perder tempo e ainda me deixou sonhar com esse apartamento (o que mais d\u00f3i, porque eu s\u00f3 fa\u00e7o sonhar em morar sozinha esses \u00faltimos tempos). Agora voltei pra o apartamento que divido com mais tr\u00eas meninas, trabalhei das 8h at\u00e9 19h da noite e a pia t\u00e1 cheia de prato. \u00d3bvio que n\u00e3o vou lavar, pois acredito que cada cachorro deva lamber sua caceta, mas eu j\u00e1 fiquei t\u00e3o triste com esse imbecil filho de uma puta desse locador e ser recepcionada com prato sujo na pia? Com uma das meninas com quem divido apartamento mais uma vez fazendo festinha no quarto dela e empesteando a casa com cheiro de cigarro?\n\nEu quero ir pessoalmente tocar fogo naquele apartamento e dar uma raz\u00e3o pra esse desgra\u00e7ado desse locador reformar aquela merda. Vou jogar uma praga t\u00e3o grande que vai dar problema nos canos, alagar a casa toda, vazar bosta por todo o apartamento dele, ele vai perder o piso de madeira dele e chorar que nem uma cabrita desmamada. Nunca que ele vai tirar o cheiro de merda que ir\u00e1 permear aquele apartamento. \u00c9 com isso que eu vou sonhar agora.\n\nPronto, chega de desabafo por hoje. Obrigada por virem ao meu Ted Talk."

Desde fevereiro n\u00e3o tem um dia em que alguma parte do meu corpo n\u00e3o esteja doendo. Eu tenho uma toler\u00e2ncia alta pra dor, mas t\u00e1 foda.\n\nAcabei de tomar um relaxante muscular forte que me derruba e me faz dormir por 10h, 12h seguidas, e que n\u00e3o tomo com frequ\u00eancia porque ele me deixa muito morgada. Hoje decidi tomar porque a dor no pesco\u00e7o tava chatinha e porque lembrei que n\u00e3o tenho urg\u00eancia de estudar (apesar de dever) e que poderei acordar tarde amanh\u00e3. E a\u00ed eu lembrei que eu ando t\u00e3o triste e t\u00e3o cansada que seria t\u00e3o bom se eu tomasse todo o estoque de musculare que tenho, e nisso eu precisei me conter e tomar um s\u00f3. N\u00e3o sei se 23 p\u00edlulas seriam capazes de me matar, mas certeza que me colocariam em um hospital.\n\nEu n\u00e3o sei o que eu quero desabafar. Pensamentos suic\u00eddas s\u00e3o uma constante, o cansa\u00e7o e a depress\u00e3o sempre est\u00e3o aqui, e eu s\u00f3 queria descansar. Dormir e n\u00e3o acordar mais. N\u00e3o vejo raz\u00e3o em diploma e trabalho e viver. Eu n\u00e3o consigo mais confiar totalmente nas pessoas porque sinto que em algum momento elas ir\u00e3o enfiar uma faca nas minhas costas e me deixarem sozinha de novo. Eu t\u00f4 vivendo um dia de cada vez, tentando me distrair, mas nada funciona. \u00c9 como se eu subitamente perdesse o meu paladar e comer n\u00e3o fizesse mais sentido, nada tem gosto, nada d\u00e1 prazer. \u00c9 mais ou menos assim que t\u00f4 encarando minha vida.\n\nComendo porque \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio. Acordando porque sou obrigada.\n\nEu s\u00f3 t\u00f4 cansada. Eu s\u00f3 queria morrer logo. Suic\u00eddio infelizmente t\u00e1 fora de quest\u00e3o pra mim por motivos pessoais, mas a cada dia fica mais dif\u00edcil. S\u00f3 queria sofrer um ataque card\u00edaco logo, ao inv\u00e9s de esperar mais quarenta anos pra isso."

A\u00ed perto do dia 25 eu come\u00e7o a ver os sinais; perda de apetite, falta de aten\u00e7\u00e3o, descuido com a sa\u00fade e bem estar. Essa semana eu n\u00e3o tive aulas, ent\u00e3o basicamente n\u00e3o sa\u00ed do meu quarto. Passar dias comendo somente uma refei\u00e7\u00e3o por dia me fez perder peso e voltei a pesar menos de 50kg. Minha anemia provavelmente voltou, porque n\u00e3o tenho \u00e2nimo para absolutamente nada e poderia passar um dia inteiro dormindo tranquilamente.\n\nHoje eu sa\u00ed de casa s\u00f3 pra comprar cigarro (eu fumo raramente), e quando estava sentada no parapeito da janela enquanto fumava, considerei me jogar. Suic\u00eddio n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma op\u00e7\u00e3o pra mim, mas em momentos de crise \u00e9 algo que me traz paz. Pensar em me jogar da janela ou cortar minha garganta me deixa mais tranquila, porque sei que n\u00e3o vou fazer isso, mas gosto de imaginar de qualquer jeito. No in\u00edcio do m\u00eas eu tive uma crise t\u00e3o forte que precisei sentar no ch\u00e3o frio do banheiro, me imaginar cortando a garganta e vendo meus amigos encontrando meu corpo pra conseguir me acalmar. E eu fico mais calma e sob controle, eventualmente - mas outubro \u00e9 um m\u00eas fodido demais.\n\nE hoje o pensamento t\u00e1 me tentando. \u00c9 como se fosse uma picada de mosquito que eu sei que n\u00e3o deveria co\u00e7ar, mas que a qualquer momento, quando ningu\u00e9m estiver olhando, eu vou acabar sucumbindo. Sei que o efeito do dia piora a situa\u00e7\u00e3o, mas todos os dias eu acordo sentindo como se estivesse me afogando no meu pr\u00f3prio fracasso. Eu s\u00f3 queria que algu\u00e9m me matasse, pra eu morrer sem a culpa de ter tirado minha pr\u00f3pria vida.\n\nA resposta \u00e9 terapia, eu sei. Eu t\u00f4 na fila pra ser atendida em um programa volunt\u00e1rio de psicoterapia, e esperando um psic\u00f3logo entrar em contato comigo. Depois de me foder financeiramente por conta da pandemia, s\u00f3 agora que t\u00f4 me recuperando a passos lentos e n\u00e3o tenho como pagar consulta privada. At\u00e9 l\u00e1, seguro as pontas do jeito que d\u00e1.\n\n\u00c9 esse meu desabafo. Prov\u00e1vel que eu edite mais tarde.  De qualquer jeito, se voc\u00ea chegou at\u00e9 aqui, obrigada por ter lido."

I explained that I currently don\u00b4t have the money or the time and he said \"Well, if you would still live here that wouldn\u00b4t be a problem\" and I said that my mental health would rapidly decline if I stayed here around him and that I\u00b4m doing much better living with my boyfriend. \n\nHe went into guilt tripping me and victimizing himself and I said \" I told you COUNTLESS of times that you\u00b4re behaviour is unhealthy. What\u00b4s more important though is that you as a father should be GLAD that your kid decided to become independant and do their own thing. You cannot guilt-trip me for anything and it is wrong that you even attempt to do so.\" \n\nHe left to the kitchen and didn\u00b4t say another word. He used to blow up when I was a child, probably because I would be easily intimidated whenever he yelled and that made him feel superior or sum. Now  he doesn\u00b4t scare me in the slightest and I stated the text above in a very calm manner so he had time to let everything sink in. \n\nWill it change something about his behaviour? Nope.\n\nBut I plan to do it again if he dares giving me sh\\*t next time I visit my mother.\n\nI read so many encounters of victims who don\u00b4t have the opportunity to talk to their nparents like that so I hope this could cheer you up a bit."

Ich kann auch Medien auf Deutsch konsumieren ohne viele Probleme.\n\nAber wenn es um Fachsprache geht, da fehlt es mir noch. In der Schule zum Beispiel muss ich viele Beurteilungen, Arbeiten und solche Sachen schreiben, ich kann es mithilfe eines W\u00f6rtebuchs machen und am Ende ist das Ergebnis gar nicht so schlimm, aber wenn man meine Arbeiten zu den von meinen Mitsch\u00fclern vergleicht, dann sind meine ziemlich mangelnd, ich kann nicht so viele Fachbegriffe benutzen, ich kann sie besser verstehen aber wenn ich selbst an sie denken muss dann ist das schwererer, und deswegen kann ich auch nicht so fancy schreiben oder viel machen.\n\nIch wei\u00df, dass ich mich nicht zu Muttersprachlern vergleichen sollte, besonders weil ich auch ja nicht seit so lange Deutsch lerne, aber ich will mich sowieso verbessern. \n\nAlso wollte ich fragen, habt ihr vielleicht Tipps, die mir helfen k\u00f6nnten? \n\nDanke f\u00fcr eure Mithilfe!"

                "body": "Hey guys, I'm only starting T in a couple weeks so this probably won't be a problem for at least a few months but it's playing on my mind a lot.\n\n\nI work in a small hardware store where most of our customers are the same tradesmen coming in every week or every other day. I just started here a couple weeks ago. As I'm pre-T I'm almost totally non passing though I am going by my chosen name (which is gender neutral). I can't bind in work either cause I work long shifts with a lot of physical exertion. Though I've ordered trans tape so that might solve this problem. \n\n\nI'm nervous about starting T and how I'll manage things if I start getting read more as a guy. I'm being introduced to all these regulars as \"the new girl\" and I worry how they'll see me/treat me as changes become more obvious. I only work with one other coworker on a daily basis at the moment and he seems pretty chill so I think coming out to him would be fine but it feels a bit too intimate as of right now as I've only just met the guy. I also wouldn't expect him to gender me correctly when I'm being read as a girl by all of our customers, but I worry about him \"correcting\" customers if they start reading me as male down the line.\n\n\nI also worry a bit about upper management as I won't see them often but I'm pretty sure HR can help me with that. My main worry is my coworker and the regulars. Has anyone else here transitioned while in a public facing job like this? How did you handle it?\n\n\nThanks guys"

As for them not being difficult to come by: I normally don't hunt coyotes so maybe I just haven't looked for them enough to accurately access their rarity, but I've actually noticed that almost all coyote packs I run into have individuals in poor or good states, very rarely perfect. But unlike some other species, coyotes are numerous and widespread.\n\nI agree as it pertains the badgers and skunks (I once spent hours trying to attain a perfect badger carcass, and still it still didn't happen).\n\nMore than anything though, I found this as annoying because the game itself didn't compensate me for the sacrifice in any way, despite it obviously stating that money will be paid upon the delivery of a bounty at the designated location and within the given time. This is the first time this particular bug has occurred for me, but it puts into question the worth of doing player bounties in the future. And together with the general abundance of recurring bugs in the game (which have often been there for years, people have pointed them out but they have still not been resolved for whatever reason), it can sometimes be an extremely frustrating experience because the various mechanisms of the system within which I'm operating are unpredictable.",

This hasn't been any large amount of text so far, but it concerns and annoys me because it opens up the possibility of progress generally being deleted without my knowledge.\n\nIt seems as though this issue resolved itself this time, but how may one minimize the likelihood of it happening again?"

The catch here is that PE and forward PE approach infinity as EPS and projected EPS get close to 0. An extremely high or extremely negative PE or forward PE can indicate low earnings, or slight losses, rather than the expectation of future growth. A company with a share price of $100 and an earnings per share of .01 would have a PE of 10000. Doesn't make it a good growth prospect, it just means they had a lackluster quarter earnings-wise. In the case of EV car company, which had a PE in the thousands as you mentioned, it was a bit of both. Stock got pumped through the roof, and earnings were low because the company is still finding is financial footing.\n\nPE is the go-to valuation metric for companies that constantly make money because it cuts straight through FUD, perception, baseless hype, sales numbers, everything. It's all about distilling a company's ability to make money and expressing it with relation to how much the shares cost, since a company that makes a lot of money but has a low share price (which would be low PE), is a good value investment. High PE generally signals that a stock is too expensive for the price. But for companies that are shifting gears, which GME certainly is, PE should be ignored until the company begins consistently making money again since it can give wildly misleading signals.",

The first quest to get the crown was really fun, but after that things started to go to shit. \n\nWe take Whiterun very messily (my follower Lydia wouldn\u2019t stop beating up my general) and I inform Ulfric. However, to my surprise, it was for nothing apparently. Whiterun still shows up in the war maps as being \u201cImperial\u201d and I can\u2019t teleport to it anymore (although just now I randomly unlocked the power to teleport back to Whiterun, but everything is the same. Balgruuf is still the jarl and neither he nor any other character makes any reference to the battle).\n\nNext, Falkreath. After some effort trying to get Galmar to assign me a quest (he was still pissed off with Lydia idk); we go to Fort Neugrad, liberate the prisoners and take the fort. Then, the game asks me to go inform Ralof, which is nowhere to be seen. Where was he, you might ask? He was standing menacingly in front of Whiterun like he had Alzheimer\u2019s and didn\u2019t remember WE JUST TOOK THE CITY and he refused to talk with me. \n\nI scout the Internet for solutions, and I read that Ralof appears on the main questline and after that it lets you complete the mission, so I let it be. Eventually, I get bored of the main questline so I use the console to complete the mission and now somehow Falkreath is suddenly blue!\n\nNext stop what\u2019s The Reach. The first quest was simple enough and it didn\u2019t break so cool. Next, I was supposed to meet up with some allies to do an assault on a caravan. Can you guess who was the commander? Yes, Ralof. Where was he this time? East of Rorikstead. What was he doing there? Apparently, beating up a random group of imperials was more important than the actual mission. Our Alexander the Great managed to single-handedly get the whole squad killed and I had to rescue his ass. After assaulting the caravan alone, I return to Galmar for my next quest in the liberation of Skyrim\u2026and he just gives me gold and proceeds to ignore me. \n\nI\u2019ve tried everything, even console, to either get or complete the next quest, but it just couldn\u2019t be done, so I decided to just leave it be. Skyrim is now on an endless civil war thanks to the greatest military genius of the era and a guy who doesn\u2019t like my assistant. \n\nIn all seriousness though, I understand that, being the game so big, that it\u2019s normal for bugs to appear here and there and *maybe* prevent you from doing a minor side quest; but the civil war? It\u2019s almost the largest side quest there is, why hasn\u2019t it been patched???"

You may have energy issues (do note that my Thoma is c4, so that helps), but Raiden-Bennett should be enough to recharge Thoma. If you don\u2019t have Raiden you can also try Fischl or an anemo character to get the VV buff, ig. \n\nAnyways have fun!"

When I try and use a pitch tracker I try to go for around 240-220hz as it seems to be a fairly comfortable height for me, but as I try and talk in it I can see the pitch at times jumping into even 120hz and I don't know if that is normal or if its something I should be trying to fix before moving on.  \n\n\nI try to follow Z's advice on the voice foundation and I don't have a problem maintaining the pitch, but the moment I try to actually speak with it I am all over the place. And basically, I don't know whether thats something i should stop to fix or if I can continue with it.\n\nI wanted to share an audio file as well, but sadly reddit doesnt support m4a that my phone records in.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nlz66ldf0ex91.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7d04079f3834523b5adea1f26ca1b091583be9ea"

In both of those cases i tried my best to cling onto the relationship only creating more mess as i went.\n\nNow with my current partner its by far not a bad relationship. Might be the first i would call healthy. However, lately i have been thinking more and more about breaking up with them. I get annoyed at some things they say, dont care about a lot of things they care about despite really trying to. And like i know that 99% this will be in most relationships. I know we cant share everything, but at the same time i just dont know how to get past these things.\n\nIts nice when we are together and just cuddle, cook, play some videogames and watch movies. But i just doubt we can make this far. I really want to try and make it through, but my experience tells me it will just make things really bad over time"

As I was finishing up and getting into the master's studies I somehow realised that this is really not something I want to continue doing (biological chemistry) and I decided to switch to medschool. \n\nI studied quite a lot for the entry exams, I already had quite a good background with my previous studies so I felt like I should be able to do it really easily. I did well on the written part and then during the interview they gave me just about 2 points below passing. I don't know what in particular did they not like about me, but right now I am just praying that some of the people who passed decide to go somewhere else and free up some space for me. \n\nThe thing is, I am already quite old, I would already be 29 when finishing medschool. I really don't want to go back to my old uni cause once I realised that this is not what I want to do with my life I hate the mere idea of studying anything in there. I have a block inside my mind that I don't know how to get past. I just feel like studying my past uni wasted my \"good student years\" and now I am trapped. \n\nI hate the idea of finishing uni when I am 30, I hate the idea of going back to my old uni, my mother is basically pushing me into constantly studying cause if I stop studying and work instead I will just never study again (in which she is admittedly right) and at the collision of these three things I just feel like the only sane solution is just killing myself... just hoping not to exist anymore and just have peace. \n\nThere is still a chance i get accepted on my preferred uni in the second draft but its kinda the only thing that is keeping me with at least some energy. Over the last few years I lost most of the motivation to do stuff that I had... I feel like nothing really matters. I got excited over possibly studying medicine and maybe finding some purpose but that seems to be going to hell and I just don't want to bother living anymore. I had severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts ever since I turned 18 and I honestly just don't see the point of trying anymore. The only reason I haven't done anything to myself yet is that it would make my family feel bad but that just doesn't seem to cut it for me anymore. Cause I dont want to feel like shit most of the time only because of that. \n\nI just wish i could get somehow motivated to do things again whether it is my old uni or somehow get accepted to medschool and enjoy it there or maybe just start a damn store somewhere and just live peacefully... but I honestly dont think i can at this point. \n\nI tried working on my mental health for about a year now and as much as I really \"hoped\" that this all just anxiety the way I just feel lost, powerless and without any motivation kinda makes me realise I am depressed. I feel like any road from the place where I am right now sucks except for ending it..."

ER and XR meds do not work for me, and IR is so much better since they only last a few hours\u2014way easier to control your sleep schedule. \n\nIf he wants to stay w/ ER meds, Obviously consult with your doctor on any dosing decisions or changes, but maybe he could just do what he did at first when he tapered up from 30 eventually to 60 and things worked out fine. I think things could be wonky for awhile, but if he just sticks it out, it could even out. Ask your doc, but maybe staying at 10 for a bit then doing 20, then going to 30 might be better than hitting him with the 30 after he\u2019s been at such a low dose. Ask doc too if they\u2019d be willing to give him a short term dose of sleep medication just so the poor guy can normal out.",

Since narcolepsy prevents adequate stage 3 deep sleep which is the stage that makes you feel rested/refreshed (and also where body repair, detoxification, and immune system strengthening occurs), I\u2019m always running on empty. So if the insomnia (yes, it sounds ironic, but it\u2019s a narcolepsy symptom) is really bad or I\u2019ve been waking up every 3 minutes one night, Adderall is just going to add more wear and tear on my vulnerable system by amping up my central nervous system, which is already stressed due to sleep deprivation. \n\nWith POTS, the CNS is like a gas pedal always being pushed with the car stuck in neutral. The body is always so worn down from being in sympathetic nerve system overdrive (that also interrupts sleep), that adding Adderall, a CNS stimulant, will just wear it down more. If I\u2019m in a bad POTS flare, I have to skip Adderall.",

I Googled more sample questions and was having a lot of fun solving them (they're not the ACTUAL questions obviously but supposed to be similar to what you would see), but I am convinced that they just included the easiest ones to make people feel better. Here are sample questions contributed to cbsnews.com by Dr. Abbie F.

They want to appear 'good' by association and leech off all the surplus happiness. Healthy people are also known for taking responsibility for their own actions and will therefore be more ready to question their own ability to communicate or understand the others persons emotions, rather than have a strong reaction to toxic bullshit, which could end the relationship. ***These things characterise strong people - not weak.***",

Gonna say, I love it.\n\nSo i've been working on my config (I started off of Endeavour's and went to make things my own way), and have got to the point where I like it a lot, but I want things on startup to work themselves out automatically.\n\n(In this post I'll use < > to contain elements that variables. These characters ought to be ignored in actually running the commands)\n\nThe solution I went for is having all the selected apps autostart with\n\n`exec --no-startup-id <app-name>`\n\nand to have said apps fixed to their respective workspaces with\n\n`assign [class=\"<app-name>\"] $ws<1-10>`\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has worked for every program and script I've set up, except for spotify, which I can get to startup, but not to go to workspace 6, which is where it's supposed to go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI found the correct class name to be \"Spotify\" with\n\n`xprop | grep WM_CLASS | awk '{ print $4 }'`\n\nwhich promted to click on the window, and gave me \"Spotify\" as an output.\n\nAt this point, I wrote the following lines (in the config they're apart from each other, because one part opens it and the other fixes it to the window. These lines are with the lines that do the same tasks so the positioning shouldn't have any weird side effects that it doesn't have there)\n\n`assign [class=\"Spotify\"] $ws6`\n\n`exec --no-startup-id sleep 2 && env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/spotify-adblock.so spotify %U`\n\n(the \"env LD...\" script is the launch script for Spotify)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpon startup, the thing will launch, but it will not be fixed to workspace 6.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help will be appreciated, and I will provide any other info you might need.\n\nhere's a my config file if need be (sry but I can't enter my github atm, so here's a link to drive, if you want the github you'll have to tell me and wait a little bit): [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C4ZXP8FGpMVqM7xow\\_GOXLbHeYVDNvNA?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C4ZXP8FGpMVqM7xow_GOXLbHeYVDNvNA?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance"

Their power certainly makes them qualify as top players, yet they're unaffected when \\*they\\* miss en passant for they lack a PIPI to drop the brick on. \n\nThey show lines where en passant is NOT the best move to children, who will one day go to a tournament hall, strong with their engine preparation and be in immense pain when they find out that en passant in actually forced. \n\nThis is a disgrace to chess, a disservice to the next chess generation and indeed, a flaw in the engine-DLC that Gary Chess released in the early 2000s. I sincerely hope for the sake of chess as a whole that this gets fixed and that the engines receive appropriate punishments for introducing flat out harmful ideas into the chess world."

Since I was a child I've always had those detailed imaginary worlds where I'd escape from real world, and I spent a lot of time improving them and adding more storylines and details.\n\nI started thinking about making them \"real\" (turning into a book) when I started highschool. I've been watching writing videos, reading more books (funny thing is that I hated books before highschool), and interacting with other writers on the internet since then. \n\nMost of the themes in my books are my real life struggles and experiences. I dissected myself and put those pieces into different characters and situations, but it's really camouflaged and you can't tell right away that that's something personal. It's a religious fantasy, since fantasy is my favorite genre, and I've always loved angels and demons. I'd say it's quite different to today's popular interpretations of celestial beings, mostly because I disliked everything I saw in media and wanted to change it. I'm not religious myself, but I love stories that come from religion. I kinda wanted to smush all religions together. \ud83d\ude05",

                "body": "Hello :)\n\nLittle info: I'm 19, live with my parents (mostly father because my mother works abroad and comes home from time to time), and I haven't yet been diagnosed with autism/asperger's (I have many reasons to believe I'm not neurotypical, and I'm really trying to find a good doctor to get diagnosed).\n\nNow, the story. My parents have been complaining how I treat them very badly, though I'm not seeing any errors in my behavior. I get nervous, like everyone does, and I have minor breakdowns when I usually say something a bit insensitive, but other than that I don't think I'm acting too bad.\n\nI'm very independent and I almost never need someone else's help, advice, or support. I don't care about people's opinions of me, or care to change any part of myself so that someone else would feel more comfortable. I've never been affectionate, and as the time progresses I'm becoming even less caring. I don't like hugs, physical contact, don't speak about my feelings, and I also don't experience any emotional connections or bonds with people. \n\nI think that me doing housework (cleaning, laundry, taking care of plants/dog), doing what they ask of me to do, minding my own business, studying hard for university is good enough behavior and it proves I'm a good kid. But apparently, that's not enough? \n\nI know I'm not a bad person, but perhaps I don't act like that. I don't have that great relationship with my father because in the past he's said some really hurtful things to me. He has anger issues and when he'd get angry he'd insult every possible thing about me and everything that I have ever done in my life. So, I started withdrawing even more. I want to protect myself. \n\nMy family seems to dislike the fact that I'm unaffectionate, but I don't want to change that. Affection makes me feel like I'm pretending to be something that I'm not. Talking about my feelings makes me feel naked, and I don't want the world to see me like that. I'm not really looking for a solution here, I just want to talk to people who will understand me and not judge me.\n\nThe worst of all is that I don't even feel bad because of my seemingly wrong behavior, I just wish they would stop criticizing me for something I can't change. I've tried talking to them more about my feelings in the past, but it made me really uncomfortable. I want my diagnosis so that they would understand that I don't \"hate\" them, I'm just a bit different when it comes to human relationships. On the other hand, a part of me knows my father wouldn't accept that I'm neurodivergent because he believes autism doesn't really exist and that if you have no cognitive development issues, you can just \"change yourself\". God, this is a nightmare. I love them, but sometimes I just want to crawl under my bed and stay isolated forever."

Before that, I just want to tell you how your kind comments helped me feel valid and I'm genuinely grateful for all of you. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/vaginismus/comments/10o5z70/im_being_forced_to_see_a_gynecologist_but_i_think/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nIt was today. I was generally very anxious, as you can see in my previous post, but I decided to try and give the doctor a chance.\nWhen I entered the room, she told me that we'll talk and then I'll get undressed, and I said I don't think I'll be undressing, to which she replied: \"Then you can just leave because we have nothing to talk about then.\"\n\nI tried to explain my situation, that I'm scared, that I'm panicking, and she said that everyone does and that I shouldn't be treated different because of it. \"All girls do this, there's a procedure, and you are no different than them.\" I was visibly upset, my voice was cracking and I was about to cry. I told her I'm very scared and that she can't expect every girl to be calm about it and that we all deserve different treatment, but it didn't matter.\n\nThen, she went about how I can't keep studying at uni if I don't do it, how 60% of women in my country die because they never visited a gynecologist, and how I as someone educated shouldn't have prejudices. She told me several times that I can't do anything if I don't visit a gyno, and I couldn't even speak anymore because I knew I'd start crying. And I am right now. \n\nI wanted help. I wanted to try and tell her my issues, but every time I protested she interrupted me. I'm a generally anxious person and I need a bit more time to think about things before saying and to process what has been said to me, and I tried making up my words and describe my issue, but she just said: \"You're probably going to say something that completely makes no sense.\" I wanted to give her a chance, but I guess I shouldn't have even tried. \n\nI have been crying for half an hour, my head hurts and my eyes burn. Nobody deserves to be treated like this and we all deserve treatment suited for us, that's that the doctors are for. I never wanted this, I just wanted to study at my university."

The only thing that's ever been down there were my own fingers, but that's only possible when I'm ovulating or just before my period begins. Any other time I'd try to put them down it would start to hurt and like I hit a wall. I was also never able to put a tampon in, and every time I tried I'd have a panick attack, be on verge of tears, and it would really hurt me. I tried relaxing, but it doesn't work. A wall. \n\nNone of my friends understand how I feel. They've been to that gynecologist and said it's fine (one is a virgin, the other one isn't), it doesn't hurt, I should just suck it up, I'm being dramatic. Their not understanding hurts me more than this entire situation, especially since they know a lot about my issues. \n\nThis is making me really anxious, and I'm 100% sure that when I get there and become aware of what's happening I'm going to start panicking and crying. I know myself. I don't deserve to experience that. My plan is to just tell the doctor I can't do it and explain my situation, but I'm afraid I'll start crying and they'll send me to a psychiatrist. I've never been assaulted in any way or experienced anything non consensual. I'm afraid I'm going to be misunderstood again. \n\nThis doesn't cause me much troubles in daily life. I'm demi-aroace, so I might never have sex and I'm okay with it. But this appointment is killing me. I can tell the doctor everything she needs to know, I can do an ultrasound or whatever they can come up with, but I can't get undressed and spread my legs. I'm sorry about this mini rant, I just needed to tell this to someone who's going to understand me, I'm literally crying right now. I'm spending more time worrying about this stupid appointment than my exams, which are far more important. \n\nI guess I just want someone to tell me it's okay to be this way, that I'm not being dramatic. I didn't choose this. I don't know what to do."

Not in a sibling type of way, where you get into fights and make amends in whatever weird way you act with them. This was all downs, no ups. He was never there for me. He never showed any signs of care towards me. I never felt loved or wanted in his presence.\nWhen I was little, he would constantly bully me, hit me, be rough with me and call me names. I've never heard him say my real name, only ugly nicknames. He used to call me spoiled brat whenever I did anything. He told me my opinions in this family will never matter and that I only have the right to ask for food. He called me fat so, so many times. He called me a fat swine. He used to hit me in the stomach. I was less than 10 years old. And I wasn't even fat, just a little chubby. He would make fun of the foods I ate that weren't vegetables and fruits (I really, really loved pasta). He gave an eating disorder and body dysmorphia. He gave me a fucking eating disorder. Since I was 7-8 years old I've been worrying about what I eat, how I look, if I should lose weight, if I looked good enough maybe I wouldn't be constantly bullied by someone who's supposed to be my brother. I always tried finding new sports so I could lose weight. I shouldn't have thought about that. I WAS LESS THAN 10 YEARS OLD. \n\nMy relationship with food was destroyed before I even knew what it all meant. For almost ten years every time I ate something \"unhealthy\" I felt guilty, especially in his presence. Only recently, less than two years ago, I've started going to the gym and thanks to my personal trainer I've started developing a healthy relationship with food. Only then it really hit what actually happened to me.\n\nMy mother has always been desperate and she wanted us to get along, but we just couldn't. She didn't do much to stop him from doing what he did. Her words meant nothing to him. My father never really said anything about it either. \n\nEventually, the brother stopped saying those things, but the damage was already done and he hasn't changed as a person at all. He has always had anger issues and threw temper tantrums every time he played video games (and he's been playing them since 2000s). He would throw things across his room, bang on the table, cuss, yell, and that was the image of him I grew up with. He didn't care what time of the day it was or if the rest of us were sleeping, he had to \"let it out\". I never felt safe with him because I felt like he could kill someone if he wanted to. I avoided talking to him, terrified he would yell at me or throw something at me. I was still less than 10 years old. I still flinch when someone raises their voice, even if it's not intended towards me. I still sometimes have nightmares about him hurting me, and I always wake up of the verge of screaming. \n\nWe're grown up now, and my family expects me to love him like nothing ever happened. Like he's not a monster that he is. I can't, I refuse to. My mother always begs me to forgive him and stop holding a grudge, but I can't and I won't. She says he's sorry, and sometimes I feel like he could be when he tries to talk to me, but then everything that has happened flashes inside my head I remember that he doesn't deserve shit from me. He never apologized. He never admitted he was wrong, ever. He always thinks he's right and that everyone has wronged him, so he's always expecting an apology. My mom keeps saying that I'm becoming worse than he was, but all I'm really doing is not talking to him. How is that worse than mentally screwing up a child so hard they've still not healed almost ten years later?\n\n\"He's a good person, he just doesn't know how to behave towards people.\"\n\"You need to give him a second chance.\"\n\"Stop holding grudges.\"\n\nNo. This is my decision, and no amount of begging is going to change my mind. I can't and I won't love my abuser. I'm not going to care about someone who's never shown love towards anything other than himself. I'm not going to care about a selfish prick of a narcissist who never admits their wrongdoings and is always the victim.\n\n\"He was a child, too.\"\n\nHe was seven years older. You could've educated him. You could've stopped this, but you didn't. He was older than I was. But you also never helped ME feel better. No family member stepped up, and you all KNEW. And now, all of you are surprised when I say I don't want to treat him like a brother, because he isn't one?\n\nI'm not perfect, I was also a dumb child like everyone was, but I didn't deserve that. I didn't deserve to have my first sibling relationship be hatred and abuse. NOBODY deserves to be abused. I'm never going to treat him like a family member, never. Even if he's the only one left alive, I'm going to find someone else. I'm going to choose my brother, and that will never be him."

I loved you, and I still do, for almost four years, but it took me three years to finally admit that to both myself and you. I thought that if I pretended I didn't love you it will go away eventually. I tried occupying my mind with other people, convincing myself I'm over you. I thought I didn't care. I thought that I learned to hate you, so I could say it was all a lie. \n\nThe worst thing is - it worked. I tricked everyone around me, including myself, that I never loved you. I loved someone else, someone who appeared to matter more. If I had to choose between you two, I would've chosen them - because they matter more, right? Well, no. \n\nYou see, people sometimes run away from their feelings because they feel too real. In order to escape what my heart really wanted, in order to deal with my unrequited love, I found an obsession and called it *true love*. They never mattered more than you, I just got addicted to them because the pain they caused me didn't really get to my heart, but my broken ego. I couldn't bare to watch you love someone else, so I did the same thing over and over again.\n\nNone of this means I've never loved you, it just means I was too broken to admit that to myself. And if you asked someone about me, they would've told you I don't love you enough to hold onto you despite it all. They would've told you that if I wanted to, I would've stepped forward. And if I told people about you, they would've told me the same thing. No. Life isn't always black and white, and there are no rules, especially in love. \n\nThe truth is, the love I have for you has brought me back to myself. When my soul finally decided to love you, regardless of what my ego thought, that's when I finally got back home. Some loves you can't rationally explain. Only when I admitted to myself how I feel, that I have no reason to run away from you anymore, only then I started to heal. \n\nYou were the one who I felt the safest with, even if we didn't really speak to each other. Every word you said, every look you sent my way was like an anchor to my broken mind, and suddenly everything was peaceful again. You never meant to hurt me, and you never did, at least not intentionally. Because you've been hurt too, and you didn't want to repeat the same thing over again. When I got the guts to tell you, I learned that while I was on a path of healing - you weren't. You were still scared of getting hurt again. And I can't say I didn't unintentionally hurt you too.\n\nNow, I don't know if I'm going insane, or if I'm delusional, but every moment I spent with you I felt like I was the most myself. I wasn't overthinking like I always do, I wasn't scared of things I couldn't control. I was *relaxed*, *light hearted*, *free*, some of the things I never am. And you caused that just with your presence, and I don't want to lose you.\n\nI know absolutely nothing about this world. I don't know if we have souls, if there's something more to humans than just flesh and bones. But if I could explain what I'm feeling without the fear of being judged by this broken world, I would say that my soul was in love with yours. That would be the only explanation. Nothing that I ever felt could've been explained differently. Maybe you really were the right person in the wrong time. We were both broken, and we both needed to heal, but we never intended to hurt one another.\n\nIf I could ask God, Universe or any higher power that might exist, I would've asked them to bring us back together once again, when we are in much better place, and give us a second chance. Because I've always loved you, from the very first moment I saw your eyes, I felt I have known you all my life. Everything you said was in sync with my mind, everything you did would've made me smile, in one way or another. I saw different versions of you through these years, and I loved and accepted each one equally, aware of all their flaws. Even when I thought I ran away from you, you'd find your way back to me in my dreams. You always have. \n\nOne thing I regret is never trully saying *everything* I felt. I never actually told you I loved you, but I did. All this time you were the only one I loved with all my heart. I have always loved you, and it's always been just you."

Mislim da je bitno napomenuti da imam 18 godina i da i dalje idem u srednju \u0161kolu. Volela bih da znam kakva su va\u0161a iskustva sa vakcinacijom, prvenstveno mladih osoba poput mene, ali sve je dobrodo\u0161lo.\n\nDa li mo\u017ee da se zaka\u017ee za ta\u010dan termin koji nam odgovara (npr. 11. septembar 16.00), ili se termin predla\u017ee tamo gde se odlu\u010di za vakcinaciju? Kako generalno zakazivanje ide? Da li treba prvo da odem kod obi\u010dnog doktora da se dogovorim oko toga, ili mogu direktno da zaka\u017eem? Nemam nikakvu hroni\u010dnu bolest niti sam ikada imala alergijsku reakciju na lek, jedini problem su sezonske alergije ali to mislim da nije presudno. \n\nDa li je bolje oti\u0107i ba\u0161 u dom zdravlja ili je promenada jednako \"dobra\" (zbog okru\u017eenja i profesionalnosti)? I sad ono najbitnije, koliko su vakcine efikasne i koja je najefikasnija? Da li ste nakon vakcinacije imali koronu i ako da, koliko je \"te\u017eak\" slu\u010daj bio? Da li morate u izolaciju ako ste bili u kontaktu sa pozitivnom osobom (pa \u010dak iako vam je u istoj ku\u0107i)? Kakve nuspojave ste imali, da li su brzo nestale?\n\nZnam da je ve\u0107 svima dosta ove teme, ali nema mnogo vakcinisanih u mojoj okolini i nemam kome da se obratim, a lak\u0161e je kada \u010duje\u0161 iskustva drugih ljudi. Moji roditelji nisu zainteresovani za vakcinu (majka je neutralna, a otac \u017eestok protivnik) tako da ne mogu ba\u0161 da se oslonim na njih. Od po\u010detka korone sam jako anksiozna (dezinfikovanje svake stvari koju sam dodirnula dok sam bila van, ode\u0107u sam prala nakon jednog no\u0161enja, ako idem negde gde je \"kriti\u010dno\" uvek ra\u010dunam kolike su \u0161anse da se zarazim i kada bi se simptomi pojavili, pa onda gledam da to ne uti\u010de na neki bitan doga\u0111aj itd), i stvarno ve\u0107 \u017eelim da se re\u0161im toga. Potrebna mi je podr\u0161ka, hvala unapred za odgovore. :)"

                "body": "Hello! I'm not even sure if this is the right subreddit, but I really have no idea who to talk to about this, so I'm hoping someone here would be able to help me.\n\nFor three years I have been having this strong intuition towards one person. I'm generally pretty intuitive and my intuition has influenced most important decisions of my life and whenever I listened to it, I made the right decision. However, intuition towards people is something I can't explain or understand.\n\nI've met this person three years ago, and the exact moment I saw their face I had a mild panick attack like I already met them. I didn't, I never even saw them, but the feeling stayed. They felt so familiar, but I eventually brushed it off because it could be anything.\n\nEvery time I'd get physically close to them, my heart and gut would go insane like a warning siren. Eventually I fell in love with them, but not like anything else before. My feelings towards them were so real, mature, calm and peaceful. I never experienced something like that. Due to me being in love with them, I have hard time figuring out if this is really just intuition.\n\nI took this really hard. I couldn't bare that I'm experiencing something this real, so I decided to do everything to stop myself from falling hard. I forbid myself to think of them, tried liking someone else, created a false reality, everything I could possibly think of because I was so scared of my feelings. This wasn't normal for me. I didn't idealize them, I saw them as they are. Most importantly, I saw *myself* with them as I am. I didn't feel the need to change anything on me in order to be \"worthy\" of them, which is something I struggled with my entire life. I pushed my feelings aside and hurt myself so much in the process. My fear caused me so much pain.\n\nWith this person I never had close relationship. We just knew each other and were in the same place. I tried to stop liking them in all ways possible, but there was no way I could do that. Few months ago, I finally admitted my feelings for them to myself. More like, my heart literally exploded after hiding my feelings for so long. The thought of them always brought me peace, everything in my head seemed so real and possible, even my dreams. Every time I thought I got over them, I had to have a dream about them. It's like my brain didn't want me to get over them.\n\nSince I let myself be in love, my brain tried pushing me towards them. I didn't want to do anything because, well, they knew I liked them (not from me though) and there were some misconceptions between us in the past, so I told myself it's over. However, my brain decided to assault me (anxiety attacks, butterflies, restlessness) until I did something. In the end did this project together, it was the best out of all of them, nothing spectacular. \n\nAfter that successful project, my brain said \"see? they don't hate you, go ahead and tell them how you feel.\" I NEVER CONFESS MY FEELINGS FOR ANYONE, AT LEAST NOT DIRECTLY AND NOT IN THEIR FACE, WHY WOULD MY BRAIN PUSH ME INTO DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT??? Sorry, sorry, I'm just so confused. I was restless until I told them how I feel. I literally couldn't do or think about anything else, so of course I had to do something.\n\nThis ended how you'd expect it to end: they don't like me back, of course. I knew that. But my brain apparently didn't. One more reason why I agreed to confess is that I tried everything to get over them except that, so maybe now I'll finally be free of them. I'm not. It's even worse. They said they're not ready for a relationship, which I respect because I'm also not ready, but my brain doesn't recognize that things are over. This intuition towards them is still there, like it's not over.\n\nWhen I was talking to them, I felt so safe and at peace. I almost accidentally spilled my entire life trauma because I felt like they would genuinely understand me. I wasn't ashamed of anything because everything felt so real and normal. I don't overshare with people I'm usually in love with because I know they wouldn't accept me (I have a shit taste), but this time it felt different. I keep repeating myself over how real everything was because it's genuinely strange and scary. I spent my entire childhood and life in my imaginary worlds and in my head, I'm basically detached from reality. Having something so real is a big deal. \n\nI analyze people I'm in love with in depth. I know their intentions, minds, how would they behave, I know their vibes. I've never felt something like this towards anyone, no matter how close we were. Of course they also drive me insane, angry, mad. I'm aware of their flaws, they're not romanticized in my head like everyone else. But even those flaws seem so real and understandable. I have no idea how to explain everything I'm feeling or WHY. \n\nWhy does my gut feeling keep pushing me towards them even though everything is over? Why can't I get over them no matter how hard I try? Why won't everything just stop???"

Before I started this weight loss journey, I used to weigh around 170lbs, and that was in September 2020. \n\nNow, I tried to do this as healthy as possible. I've been going to the gym ever since then three to four times a week (two of those would be one hour with personal trainer, and one-two one hour cardio). My diet was mostly just cutting out all sweets and junk food, white bread, all drinks that aren't water/tea (without sugar) etc. Basically, all \"unhealthy\" foods. I only ate sweet stuff for holidays or when I really felt the need for sugar.\n\nI'm happy with what I managed to accomplish. I've been \"overweight\" for most of my life and this was truly life changing for me, I feel so much more comfortable in my skin, and I also love that I learned how to control my bad eating habits.\n\n*However*, as the title says, in the past maybe month or two I'm ALWAYS hungry. NOTHING makes me full, like I'd literally eat meals twice as big as I used to and I'd be hungry after an hour like I haven't eaten in days. Few ways ago we had a large pizza for lunch. We've been buying the same pizza since forever, and in the past I could barely eat three slices and be full the rest of the day. This time, I ate three slices and felt like I could go more (but didn't). In less than an hour I was STARVING. I even baked pancakes a couple of times and ate at least ten of them, I was still hungry. It's like there's a black hole in my stomach. \n\nSince January I've started drinking more water to avoid overeating but now I feel like I'm drinking more because I'm hungry. Last time I checked, after that pizza I had on Friday and some sweets I ate day before, I weighed LESS than I did before I ate all that (and I didn't exercise in this period). I'm genuinely confused about everything.\n\nI've talked with my personal trainer about this, of course, and he said that I'm in constant caloric deficit and that I should eat more than I do. I'm not sure what to eat more. I'm terrified that if I eat more I'll gain all that weight again and I don't want that to happen. Does anyone have any advice? Could I easily gain weight again?"

                "body": "Hello everyone, I\u2019m 14 years old, got this condition when I was 13. But now, the day has finally come, the day I can feel free again. The day where my life can become like anyone else\u2019s again. Here we are, the end of this unpredicted challenge, a challenge I never thought I would encounter, let alone get through. Here we are, the gates of freedom, let me begin.\n\n**The Start, September 4th 2020**\n\nMy family was going on a road trip that would last roughly 8 hours. I realized that I could definitely listen to almost every Beatles song in chronological order on the way there with headphones. All though that was a fairly enjoyable experience, it costed... I came back and any sound I heard was unbearable. I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone, I couldn\u2019t go anywhere without covering my ears. The worst part is that I didn\u2019t know what it was, or what I were in for.\n\nI go to the local doctor. He checks my ears and finds 2 ruptures. With the 2 ruptures he tells me I have perforated eardrums, and that they should be better and all good again within a few weeks. In the meantime, if sounds bothered me I could use earplugs. So I did, I would wear them almost everywhere. My situation did not improve nor did it decline. After a few weeks it didn\u2019t go away. So I went to the ENT. Going to this one specifically I believe was a huge mistake. She said I might have TMJ. Which can be permanent for some people. Going home and looking up the symptoms, it seemed manageable. Ironically enough I had a dentist appointment that week. Who checked and confirmed that I most likely would not have it. Especially for my age. We went back to the ENT a few weeks later and she still doubted the dentist. Saying I still most likely had it. I was now edging almost 2 months into this condition, completely oblivious to what it was. My ENT scheduled a audiologist to do a hearing test, which came back perfectly normal. This only lead my ENT to no longer take my condition seriously.\n\n**Realization, November 1st 2020**\n\nI decided that doctors would no longer be a help, I would have to resort to the good old fashion internet. Googling my symptoms, I was assure I had hyperacusis. The first time I would enter this subreddit. Here may have been my biggest mistake yet. Unhealthy browsing patterns and addiction to reading terrifying experiences with hyperacusis. I have made some old posts here but have deleted them. I remember one person telling me that it will most likely take a good 5-7 years to improve. Stupid me forgetting the number one rule online; *not to trust random strangers with medical advice that have no medical degree.* I would do everything people on this subreddit would tell me too. I got myself a pair of industrial earmuffs, I would wear them everywhere. If a sound only slightly irritated me I would immediately go into hiding. All while crying about this condition and getting into terrible unhealthy habits. I hated my life, this was also around the same time a very close female friend of mine who I like romantically started distancing herself and completely ignoring my issue. But that drama is not relevant. For the rest of November. I would continue the same pattern, Isolate - read Reddit - cry -unhealthy food - other activities I will not say - cry again - sleep - repeat. My work quality was downgrading. I started to feel stress and anxiety on an every day basis. I hated where life was going and I saw no way out.\n\n**Action, December 15th 2020**\n\nFriends gave me plenty advice, telling me to stop reading about hyperacusis and to move with my life and hope for the best. I kept ignoring this until one day I decided to finally take the initiative to try listening. I wouldn\u2019t close my ears in agony if I heard a small minor sound, I wouldn\u2019t wear earplugs everywhere. And most importantly I would stop reading articles everywhere about this condition. I also during this time would attempt listening to music on considerably low levels and gradually increasing the volume to \u201cget used to it.\u201d I read that this may work for SOME people. So I tried it out. After maybe 2 weeks I started seeing a good amount of improvement. Life started to get better. It was nowhere near back to normal, but I could do basic activities again. Talking to people became only a minor irritation. \n\nThen the new year came, I found myself incredibly lucky to scroll past a comment by a user by the name of u/Enoch11234. He mentioned how staying calm, and trying to manage stress would help you majorly to combat hyperacusis. I would see people reply to him aggressively. Telling him that they took his advice and it only made them worse. People saying how exposing themselves to noise would worsen their condition. But they didn\u2019t read his comments enough. They didn\u2019t take into account the key word. **Stress.** I came to a realization that this condition, all though not based off of, but can be seriously affected by stressing over it. All the crying done, all the complaining and story reading. It only made me more pessimistic and made me feel even more upset about hyperacusis. For some reason which I do not fully understand, remaining calm and managing stress will help. All though it helps a little less for some people. There is absolutely nothing wrong with trying it out. It won\u2019t worsen your condition in anyway managing stress. So what\u2019s the issue with his method?\n\nAnother thing I did was noise exposure but constantly reminding myself that a good part of this condition was within my head. No, of course I would not blast my ears with noises and tell myself this, no, of course I wouldn\u2019t purposefully attempt to fully feel better by playing music from headphones at 100%. Instead, I would go for walks, watch cars whoosh buy, watch TV at a moderate volume and try to completely forget about the condition. And after maybe a month. I could see drastic improvement. The finish line became clear.  With small amounts of CBT, (no meme intended ;).) Stressing over this became easier to manage. I took a break from the subreddit. I didn\u2019t have to wear earplugs anymore. All or mostly from some psychological working. Many people here said that it\u2019s not in your head, and it\u2019s 100% a physical condition. But I think it should be understood that little research has been done on hyperacusis and everyone\u2019s case has shown to very. Managing stress does not and will never negatively affect you. So it\u2019s worth the try at least.\n\n**Aftermath, January 30th 2021**\n\nI completely forgot about hyperacusis for a good 2 months. Only to remember parts of it in March. There was mild pain but I simply dismissed it. I stopped letting hyperacusis dominate my life. I got back to what I was supposed too. It majorly helped to sidetrack it. Simply feeling unaware of what was even going on. If anything, September and October were much better months then November, only because I didn\u2019t overthink this stupid condition. Life around this time felt normal. And in late febuary the finish line was clear.\n\n**The End of the Line, April 5th 2021** \n\nI have felt no pain whatsoever from sound since April 5th recorded! I have decided to write this for everyone who thinks there won\u2019t be an end. I can assure you that there is and I am sitting here waiting for you all right now! Don\u2019t you ever give up, your life is not over, don\u2019t ever believe for a second it is. Going through this condition at such a young age is terrifying. But I can tell you that after all of it I feel like myself again. People move on from this condition and get back to their life\u2019s just like me aswell. You simply need to keep going, there is no stop. Stop blaming yourself, you will get here. I have wrote all this just to tell you. You will get better!\n\nThank you all for reading this, if you have any question or concern, feel free to comment or DM me! I\u2019ll write an update 3 months later aswell!"

I started to go slower but I didn\u2019t know why. Eventually we were deep into the city. (Masks of course.) and then bam, my tire breaks. So great... now I\u2019m in the middle of a loud busy city with a flat tire and no earplugs either. So what do I do? I start walking back and talk to my friend. The noises around me hurt a little. Loud trucks and fast cars. An idiot even went as far and blasted their music with their windows down. It hurt. But after 2 hours of listening to loud annoying traffic, the pain went down. I came home and I actually felt really good however. I listened to headphones to see if I could handle them and to my surprise I could and stopped after about an hour. I could watch TV. Use cutlery properly and could even handle both my huge dogs barking. \n\nToday I don\u2019t feel as good as I did yesterday. But this makes me think. If we distract ourselves from the noises. We could get closer to being better. I\u2019ve applied this for the past month and have only seen major improvement with minor setbacks that would only last a few hours. I\u2019ve also tried to avoid silence as much as possible and still have at least a quiet source of sound in the background. I\u2019ve calmed myself down around sounds and it\u2019s safe to say that my life is seriously heading it\u2019s way back to being normal.\n\nWell that\u2019s my story, I\u2019m not fully recovered yet. But that\u2019s what helped me. Feel free to ask questions :)"

I kept thinking how they lacked craftiness, the zeal, or raison d\u2019etere to gain upward social mobility.\n\nBut today was a slap in my face proving that I am just the same if not worse.

As a woman you shouldn\u2019t need a man but want one, which means you should be capable of taking care of yourself financially, emotionally, mentally and physically. A great relationship is where two individuals who are independent come together and take care of each other. Your ex wants to isolate you so that you just depend on him, this is a crazy risk to take because you don\u2019t know the future. \n\nIn today\u2019s competitive and fast paced economy even a year worth of break can set your career years behind, what happens if he refuses to take care of you in the future and you have to start from zero. It\u2019s a wonderful thing to trust somebody that much but it is also foolish and can backfire.\n\nAlso, a good partner is not someone who asks you to change your core values or undermine your success. A good husband /boyfriend would be cheering for you everytime you win in life. He would be there for you talking it out when you feel nervous for an interview, he would be the first one to dance with joy when you get promoted. You get just one life and you should live it on your own terms. If someone has different values they can find someone with similar values as them. \n\nTrust me when I say this you are extremely young right now, your life has just begun. Don\u2019t waste it behind a guy who doesn\u2019t see you as an individual and doesn\u2019t respect you right to freedom. Find someone who celebrates your wins as you will celebrate his. And I agree with everyone here you are lucky he didn\u2019t dupe you into marrying you, it would have been even worse breaking up a marriage. Move forward with your head held high, go achieve amazing things, a real loving partner wouldn\u2019t try to fit you in a box of his choice but would let you soar. Please do not take this man back, he has a long long long way to go before he can truly mature and become an empathetic individual.",

Since money isn\u2019t an issue for you, research and attend some of the courses that are designed towards self improvement but in a group setting. \n\nYou could take up woodwork, pottery, dance, something that requires you to be amongst people. \n\nAnd not wise just someone who has gone around the sun a lot more.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t think our education system is great because it promotes mugging up rather than free and innovative thinking so don\u2019t go a conventional route. Think of some crazy skillsets like creating ceramic pots or blowing glass. You have a beautiful beautiful opportunity that many crave for, the privilege you have many would kill to have those so they could follow simple joys. I am not saying that your struggles or your feelings are not valid, but right now your perspective makes it seem like a negative thing, some introspection may help you shift your perspective and you could find a peaceful, non toxic hustle yet fulfilling life. \n\nI would also suggest volunteering if possible, help the lesser privileged by giving your time at an orphanage, old age home etc, you could teach kids, help them find their true potential and happiness.\n\nAlso I tip my hat to the Monty Python reference!!!",

But I can make the station programs interesting, raise issues of the city, begin a dialogue about something hyper-local. \n\nWe will give due credit to whoever's content idea we use. \n\nP.S. Our station is looking for an RJ who is a fun story teller and loves social media as well. Since my frequency is in Hindi it's important for them to be fluent in Hindi. \n\nExcited to explore Hyderabad as this is my first time living there. \n\nPeace."

Having a lot of allies or Having a powerful military?\n\nSo hopefully the moderators will allow me to post this. \n\nI wanted to fill you in so the compare and contrast would be more understandable. But when Donald Trump was in office he offered a style of US diplomacy. I\u2019m sure you guys remember him saying everywhere even to our closest Allies in Europe even in North America \u201cit\u2019s going to be America first.\u201d With things like threatening to pull out of Alliances like NATO demanding \u201cNations pay their fair share.\u201d This direction also included in my opinion an overinflated Military Budget I believe it\u2019s at $730 billion this also meant that he only cared about protecting American interest overseas rather than the interest of our Allies. Do you believe this is effective diplomacy compared to the original Status Quo? \n\nHere I\u2019ll give an example of continuing the Status Quo would look like.\nSo as you know China has had an extremely Rapid Rise over the last couple of years President Xi has stated that his ambitions for China go beyond becoming the leading Economy in the world but also expanding China's military to be on par with the United States if you will. \nSo my idea comes from the same \u201ccontainment field\u201d that NATO had against the Soviet Union and even Russia today. Japan, South Korea, and America (maybe even India) can lead an effort in the Pacific to form a \u201ccontainment field\u201d around China to deter China from becoming expansionist as it\u2019s shown with Hong Kong and now looking at Taiwan. Also working with nations to stifle China from influencing nations to become dependent I guess you could say for example the situation in Australia even though they\u2019re great Allies thy are still stuck between siding with America militarily and China economically, America should especially begin trying to begin to influence certain African Nations in my opinion too just as China has.\n\nNow, of course, there\u2019s a lot more going on around the World than just China but I wanted to get your guy's opinion and which is the best course of action for a future time. \n\nHaving a lot of allies and creating new ones in the Pacific or Having a powerful military? \n\nEdit: I've been debating with myself about it for a while and I still think there's no clear-cut answer Diplomacy is such a situational thing anyway."

I will try to explain it like this: There are categories of countries based on income. Say that it is considered that middle-income countries are those with an annual GDP per capita between $1000 and $12500. Anything above that is considered a high-income nation. Now, this is perfectly fine for most people to remember and accept. However, my brain will just refuse to categorize countries based on this. I can't put a country with an annual GDP of $1000 in the same category as a country that has a GDP of $12000, while at the same time putting that country with a GDP of $12000 in a *different* category than a country with a GDP of $12600. This is the most basic example I could think of, so it may not be completely accurate. Any other people who struggle with this? And any tips on remembering and categorizing things like these?"

Tu me disais que c'\u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement de ta faute si tu n'as pas su t'ouvrir et ruiner la relation. Je ne peux pas te laisser dire \u00e7a.\n\nJ'en suis tout autant responsable. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 trop attach\u00e9\u00b7e \u00e0 toi. Je ne pouvais pas te l\u00e2cher, tu \u00e9tais toute ma stabilit\u00e9 \u00e9motionnelle. Et je suis rest\u00e9 sur ma zone de confort tout du long. Il y avait clairement des signes, et je les ai ignor\u00e9, par d\u00e9ni, je suppose.\n\nPeut-\u00eatre que je suis cyclothymique, mais j'ai avant tout une carence affective, et je me suis rem\u00e9mor\u00e9 des signes de \u00e7a depuis l'\u00e2ge de 6 ans. Ca va \u00eatre chaud \u00e0 gu\u00e9rir, dans ce cas, mais tout peut se gu\u00e9rir, ou se r\u00e9apprendre surtout. Je peux changer.\n\nJe t'avais dis \"Fais comme tu le sens\", et tu m'as r\u00e9pondu \"Si je fais comme je le sens, j'arr\u00eaterais de te parler\", et je ne savais pas quoi r\u00e9pondre. Je me suis dit que tu blaguais. Parce que je ne voulais pas y croire.\n\nJ'ai ignor\u00e9 les messages de tes animash, \u00e9vitant d'essayer d'aborder le sujet, j'avais peur de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\n\nJusqu'au jour o\u00f9 tu m'as parl\u00e9 de Gui et que tu allais faire un choix. J'\u00e9tais confiant. Puis le lendemain, j'ai connect\u00e9 les points, et j'ai explos\u00e9 en sanglot.\n\nJe suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9\u00b7e, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de ta souffrance. J'aurais aim\u00e9 t'apporter l'aide n\u00e9cessaire.\n\nJe ne pensais pas que ma carence affective pouvait causer des dommages ! Je me suis dit \"C'est juste un besoin de c\u00e2lin\", sauf que c'est \u00e7a qui te for\u00e7ait \u00e0 voyager jusqu'\u00e0 moi.\n\nJe suis content d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 tes c\u00f4t\u00e9s, mais j'aurais aussi aim\u00e9 t'apporter l'aide et le soutien dont tu avais besoin.\n\nCe qui est fait est fait. \u00c0 l'avenir, j'aimerais pouvoir \u00eatre ton support d'une mani\u00e8re non brusque, non oppressante, non d\u00e9pendante.\n\nJe t'aime \u00e9norm\u00e9ment.\n\nMOUARF !"

I have online friends, tho.\n\nSo, I'm actually in therapy. Nothing special, I talk about my life and the psy tells me that I should stop having bad thoughts by having fun. I told him that maybe I should use some CBT, and he didn't know what that was.\n\nI live somehow far from the nearest big city (I still can go by train on weekends), so I struggle to find another therapist. I have a bad internet connection. So it'd be hard having a follow-up.\n\nI've heard of EMDR and I wondered if that'd be somehow useful for what I have. I heard it was mostly for traumatic events, and don't know if that would work for my emotional deprivation. Or should I still search for a CBT therapist?\n\nThanks"

                "body": "I meant to put i made a 2% BHA exfoliant not toner, but I can't edit the title TT\n\nHey y'all!\n\nFor the longest time I've seen and heard from people struggling with dissolving salicylic acid and keeping it dissolved. So I did a bunch of research and even helped someone fix a there formula and they gave me feedback saying the SA had not recrystalized so far (YAY!) [This should be it](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/ibfy8b/need_help_simple_questions_basic_beginners_help/g20l949?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3). If I linked the wrong thread just tell me. I also shared this somewhere don't remember where.\n\n\nAnyway, I came here to share my thought process and see if anyone had any extra ideas so that others could benefit. I didn't really know how to start with this because while I got the idea from Paula's choice I didn't really make te formula from that... but I'll start with Paula's choice.\n\n\nPaula's choice 2% BHA Exfoliant:\nWater (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n\nPaula's choice Regular Strength Anti-Redness Exfoliating Solution With 2% Salicylic Acid Ingredient list:\nWater (Aqua), Dipropylene Glycol (hydration), Pentylene Glycol (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Glycerin (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Panthenol (hydration), PEG/PPG-17/6 Copolymer (texture-enhancing), Methyl Gluceth-20 (hydration), Glycereth-26 (texture-enhancing), Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane (hydration), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer), Sodium Metabisulfite (stabilizer).\n\nAs you can see I linked two ingredient lists for 2 bha products but formula is more based on the first one. I linked the second one as a reference due to the fact that it used way more glycols and that plays into my dupe?\n\n\nAnyway: the Paula's choice 2% BHA exfoliant ingredient overview:\n\nWater: water\n\nMethylpropanediol: humectant, solvent, helps with absorption of Salicylic acid. \n(I have no earthly idea where to get this ingredient, so I'm not including it at all)\n\nButylene Glycol: humectant, solvent\n(I used Propylene glycol instead of this)\n\nSalicylic Acid: the reason were here\n(This is going to be dissolved in the propylene glycol)\n\nPolysorbate 20: helps stabilize the Salicylic acid and keep it from recrystalizing\n(Gonna use this anywhere from 2 to 5%)\n\nCamellia Oleifera Leaf Extract: Green tea extract\n(Not necessary, but nice. You could use the powdered at 0.5% or the liquid at like 1 to 2%)\n\nSodium Hydroxide: ph adjuster\n(I would use this at the end to adjust the ph)\n\nTetrasodium EDTA: stabilizer, chelating agent\n(You could leave or keep this in. The Paula'schoice BHA doesn't have a preservativebecause of the high amount of humectant/glycols in their formula I believe)\n\nNow you are starting to see why this isn't exactly a dupe.\n\n\nNow let's start explaining. Making cosmetics says that SA is 3 to 6% soluble in Propylene glycol. That means you need to make a salicylic acid solution in Propylene glycol at 6%. This 6% SA solution in Propylene glycol (were just gonna say PG cuz I'm tired of typing this out) needs to be used at 33% of the total formulation to get 2% salicylic acid in our formula. Does this make sense?\n\nNow here is the formula that's not really a dupe that I posted in the thread link I shared earlier.\n\n2% Salicylic acid\n\n31% propylene glycol\n(Or 33% of a 6% salicylic acid solution)\n\n1% Sodium citrate\n\n5% Polysorbate 20 (you might have to lower this depending) (you could also replace this with poly 80, peg 40 hydrogenated castor oil)\n\nAnd then use water to 100 (or 61% in this case)\n\n\nThe sodium citrate is used to help make sure the SA doesn't recrystalize and could also function as a ph adjuster. The polysorbate was used at 5% cuz I was terrified it would recrystalize, you could lower this, but definitely use at least 2%). I did not mention a preservative in the formula i gave her because I forgot. I would put one in because I don't trust my formulation skills or sanitation. Replace some of the water with a preservative of your choice. \n\nThe original person a made this formula for said it had a greasy feel. This is definitely due to the high amount of PG and may be partly due to the polysorbate 20. But it didn't recrystalize so that's a win??? The skin feel can definitely be improved upon though lol.\n\n\nNow here is a version I've been trying to work on that is slightly more like a dupe (if you squint): I have yet to try this.\n\n2% Salicylic acid\n\n31% propylene glycol\n(Or 33% of a 6% salicylic acid solution)\n\n1% Sodium citrate\n\n3% Polysorbate 20 (I lowered this)\n\n0.5% powdered green tea extract (or 1 to 2% liquid)\n\n0.2% Tetrasodium EDTA \n\nAnd then use water to 100 (or 62.3% in this case)\n\n\nA really important tip is to make sure the Exfoliant is above 3 in ph. The Paula's choice one has a ph between 3.2 and 3.8. If the ph of it is too low the SA will recrystalize. Please remember this. In fact I remember reading somewhere at ph lower than 3.5 you often get SA precipitating out of the solution...\n\nNow can adjustments be made? Absolutely \ud83d\udcaf. Please play with this. I really want to olimprove the skin feel of this product. Now that I've found that it doesn't recrystalize with this, I plan on trying to slowly lower the amount of propylene glycol to see how low I can take it before the formula starts hating me \ud83d\ude06. \n\n(And I want to make a gel out of it. Like a thicker serum type with more good skin feeling ingredients. Maybe use something like sepigel 305 so I can add silicones and get a gel cream. Can it even handle acids... Hmm)\n\n[Here is a link to a chemists corner thread](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/comment/20464#Comment_20464) that helped me a lot.\n\nYou could add other humectants too. This could be very helpful with hydration and helpful in keeping SA solibulized. I wanna see if I can add glycerin and socium lactate. Allantoin, other extracts, and etc!!! THE WORLD IS YOUR OYSTER ( absolutely wrongnuse of this quote...)\n\nYou can buy pre solubulized SA from making Cosmetics if you don't wanna go through all this trouble ( I'm currently stuck with 100g of SA so...) you could say flip it all and use alcohol. Or you could use octyldodecanol (i think that's what it's called) also sold at making cosmetics. Better than PG worse than alcohol. \n\nFeel free to share, give advice, but please point back to his thread so we can get some knowledge \ud83d\ude09. I will be posting an updated formula with more goodness added and a better skin feel... in the near future.... honestly I remember....\n\nNext on my list? Urea. It shall be conquered. I will make a basic formula out of you that I can share. I will. Once you come in the mail \ud83d\ude00"

What's the issue with using Ultra Pasteurized milk?\n\nTo understand why I'm asking this let's go back to my little freak out when I first started making milk kefir.\n\nI was about a week into making kefir milk and I was wondering why my milk kefir would not thicken up at all. By that time I had realized my kefir grains probably needed time to adjust. But then I read an article that said something like \"switching from types of milk will require adjustment time... blah blah... \n\n... Never use ultra pasteurized milk. It's essentially dead and it will ruin your grains.\"\n\nNow, I wanted to be careful. So I pulled out my gallon of milk and who would have thought? Organic whole milk *ultra pasteurized*. \n\nCue the *major* freak out session\n\nI was there wondering if I'd majorly ruined my grains and messed up big time. After calming down I decided to let things be. What was I gonna do? My mom always buys organic whole milk. It's near impossible to find organic whole milk that wasn't ultra pasteurized. I'd already been using it on my grains for a week. \n\nLet's just see how things go.\n\nHow are things going now? *Great!*\nI'm about four to five weeks in, my kefir is coming out thick and strong after leaving it a little ove 24 hours and my grains have quintupled in size. More than that actually. I don't know what I'm gonna do in a few weeks. And that's with the awful bipolar weather that keeps going from hot to cold.\n\nSo what's the issue with ultra pasteurized?\n\nI've read several article and blogs running ultra pasteurized through the grinder. They say it's dead, it has absolutely no bacteria so it's bad, the milk is cooked. And yet...\n\nDon't kefir grains feed off of the fat in the milk? So isn't having whole fat milk more important than it being ultra pasteurized?\n\nI'm not saying don't use other types of milk. Raw milk, in my opinion, is still the best choice. Avoid ultra pasteurized if you can.  And some people say ultra pasteurized didn't work for them (assuming they gave the kefir grains at least a two week adjustment time) and some people said the kefir tasted different. \n\nWhich I understand. Different types of milk will produce different types of kefir.\n\n*But why all the hate?*\n\nIs it something somewhat else said and people just repeated it? Do they have something against organic milk cuz it only ever comes out ultra pasteurized? Are the health benefits not enough? Why does it having little to no bacteria suck when kefir grains are literally putting good  bacteria back in anyway? Or am I looking at this all wrong?"

And a life without feeling wanted and loved as well as the ability to love is a meaningless one. Hence why after that period, if the date never occurs, I will end my life on August 1st 2023.\"\n\nAnd during the set time, I said that I will work on myself as much as one can.\n\n- I started to go to the gym to lose weight;\n- I went to my doctor because my depression worsened at the end of September and I asked for medical help;\n- I changed therapists and started to see progress too;\n- I have tried to cook on my own which is actually enjoyable and satisfying;\n- I accepted every opportunity to go out with other people;\n- I got an appointment at a psychiatrist at the request of my therapist;\n- I even started to think of ways that I could break the pact myself using some obscure technicality because I didn't want to go with it.\n\nI was actually feeling better before February.\n\nBut now, I only wish I had killed myself long before, as I see that no matter what I'm going to do for myself, it'll never replace the feelings of happiness that only love can bring me.\n\nAnd after yet another rejection from a girl who has shown genuine interest in me since the start of February, I have no more hope that life could bless me with a miracle of having that one simple date.\n\nAnd I'm not talking about a blind date or anything similar. I want the person to agree to meet me knowing full well who I am. I want them to accept me.\n\nStill, the rejections just keep piling up, so I am spiraling back to square one and am ready to give up on life and just wait those agonizing 5 months and a half to finally pull the trigger and be free from it his suffering.\n\nBut if by some miracle, that date actually comes true, I said that I will never again consider suicide as an option. EVER.\n\n...we all know that I am going to die in August, so can we just speed up the clock and get this over with already?"

                "body": "Hi! So. The situation is that on occasions (not always), I would shampoo and condition my hair, go to sleep with my hair wet & splayed on a pillow, and I would wake up with the mid-lengths all clumped together (like it was waxy and greasy). The roots and ends are fine and don't have this issue. \n\nAt first, I thought I hadn't been washing my conditioner out completely. So I started being very thorough each time I rinsed my conditioner out. That didn't work. Then I switched up my shampoo & conditioner. Still didn't work. I let my hair air dry naturally, still didn't work (it would feel like it never dried, before I realised it actually WAS dry, but the mid lengths only felt wet cause it was clumped together, and waxy). Then I did some r/haircarescience research, and discovered \"hard water\". Don't think this is the case as my room mate (who has her own bathroom) has never experienced this. The funny thing is, this only started happening to me a year ago when I moved into this apartment, and I had NEVER experienced it before.\n\nIt's now gotten to the point where I would wake up (after washing my hair) and it would feel like I left product in it in the mid-lengths, and I would go rinse out my hair again (which only helps marginally), but then that makes me super late for work.\n\nI'm not too well versed with haircare, and my products do have sulfates in them (they always have though), and I only wash my hair once or twice a week. I don't use any other products outside of dry shampoo every now and then. My hair isn't coarse or thick, but very long, but I have a lot of it on my hair (a trip to the hairdresser for a dye is a 5 hour mission!)\n\nPlease help me, haircare wizards! I'm tired of waking up with dirty greasy hair! :'("

I forgot about having been there on acid until i got there again on dxm. \n\nThere was a lot of weirdness before I got there... Some skeleton had to remind me to let the music be my driver (i think at that point i was listening to funeral by arcade fire which is the same album i was listening to the last time I went to this place even though I never listen to that normally) then we rode this little space ship/car thing to our destination.\n\nIt was like a word that was just a little city... Not much besides buildings and people, the buildings were almost like a video game missing texture, all the same color but different sizes. The other people there were all people from earth who were currently trying and all just hanging out enjoying themselves on their own. I then became the skeleton that had helped me get there (or maybe we merged) and i was flying on a skateboard between the buildings, wondering why I'd forgotten about that place. \n\nIt wasn't a round planet, when i came to the edge it would be a 90 degree angle and I'd just go over the side and there'd be more of the same thing.  I/the skeleton had a long tidy of green and pink hair from the top of the head that streamed behind while flying. I alternated between seeing things from the skeleton and viewing it from the outside."

                "body": "Hello there, medical student here (FMPC), as you might\u2019ve (or not) seen recently, many events have been unfolding over the past few weeks, and the current state is not really hopeful, with common misunderstandings and click-motivated media, it has become so easy to distract the public opinion from our principal cause, which is that \u201cthe quality of medical education in Morocco is in grave danger\u201d, judging by a multitude of factors:\n\n1. Medical departments are overcrowded, with 60 to even 80 students in one department, which obviously puts the quality of medical education in danger, \u201cProfessor \n/Beds to Student\u201d ratios are heavily unbalanced, and it\u2019s impossible to learn anything in such a crowded space, especially with the medical field being one that values practice over theory. Some cities still don\u2019t possess their own teaching hospitals (CHU) -which was promised years ago- and have to rely on CHPs with minimal resources.\n\nFaced by all these issues, the government still finds it in its best interest to increase the total headcount year after year, without taking into account any of these issues, as much as we\u2019d love to battle the shortage of healthcare professionals in this country (something that is caused by brain drain more than anything due to the mediocre state of our healthcare), our infrastructure cannot even take the current numbers of medical students in hospitals or amphitheaters, let alone an increase of any kind.\n\n2. It\u2019s extremely unclear what the third-cycle consists (or will consist) of, with a reduction of the duration of medical training from 7 years to 6 years rationalized by a will to \u201caddress the shortage of healthcare professionals in Morocco\u201d, a reduction that was sudden and lacking details, it\u2019s simply irrational to come up with such decisions that will totally influence the quality of our education on the fly with no clear plan, leaving medical students with a foggy future raising so many concerns.\n\n3. Alongside our major issues, there is also a financial one, when you reach the third year of medical studies, you start learning in a teaching hospital by day while also doing night shifts, and you get an allowance of 630DHS, which results in 21DHS per day, something that is clearly not enough for a regular student, especially ones from different cities or even far areas in the same city (something so prevalent in a large city like Casablanca), however, the bigger problem lies in the fact that most students don\u2019t even get their payments in time, and even when they get them, it\u2019s usually divided or overdue, something that negatively impacts the socioeconomic condition of the regular medical student, which in turn affects their quality of education.\n\n\nKeep in mind that all of the sit-ins and assemblies that took place over the last few weeks have happened after a constant request for discussion from the CNEMEP -medical, dental and pharmacy students\u2019 national commission- towards both Higher Education and Health Ministries for years with no concrete results.\n\nI tried to gather all the big ideas into this post, I hope it was clear enough, I can also provide more context and info through other links if needed, and I\u2019d be happy to know your thoughts.\n\nThank you for reading."

One of the things I think the games could do better, for example, is to show the physical effects of too much lyrium use. Exposure to raw lyrium is supposed to kill a mage, but our characters can walk through the Bastion of the Pure with all those raw lyrium veins and never even express concern.\n\nThe scenes where Eleven's friends watch her and can tell she's fighting telepathically because her body is shaking and nose is bleeding remind me of my Warden going into the Fade to fight Connor's demon. It would be cool to see your friends/LI express more concern about that. And I now picture my Inquisitor after the Trespassser battle with Saarebas bleeding from her eyes with her hair singed off. Maybe I'm being dramatic but it would be cool to see just how difficult high level spell casting, especially against another mage, really is. Maybe even see the effect mages are having on the spirits of the Fade they're drawing on during the battle."

I think blackgaze don't have the same amount of aggression and track length that post-bm has, and the vocals sometimes are annoying(in general vocals are a hit or miss for me).\n\nTbh I'm not sure what I'm looking for; maybe a more agressive, instrumental blackgaze influenced by Ride-Nowhere instead of MBV?

Someone to grow with and go through life with. The idea that I might end up spending my life without such a person is starting to scare me.\n\nI simply can\u2019t seem to find anyone I am interested in to that point and few come close, and when they do, they are never that interested in me. I yearn for such a deep love yet I\u2019m the first one to not have even felt it yet.\n\nPlease tell me, when and how did you people in happy long term relationships meet your partners? I have seen so many of my friends finding love without searching for it and it lasting pretty long with little issues. How long did it take for yours to become a relationship? Is there always hope?"

There were talks about sexism and gender roles. Then, really suddenly, everyone is hounding her to get married. \n\n>!Paulina is a noble lady who has been abused by her family; She is captured during war and joins the enemy kingdom. That emperor, who has several wives with whom he loves and sleeps with, falls in love with her. Sometime later, folks start hounding her to get married, and she considers one dude, but it turns out he wants to use her for her money and title. !<\n\n>!Anyways, the writer falls on our favorite trope of sleeping with someone while drunk. She gets pregnant and runs away to have the baby. The emperor finds her, and she goes off on him. She does not love him, she doesn't want to marry him, she doesn't even want the baby. She just wants to maintain her titles. She talks about how sexist marriage is and that it's not fair that she has to lose everything she worked hard for. She doesn't want to be the empress (he has 2 \\~ 4 consorts atm). !<\n\n>!But of course he wears her down, and she agrees to marry him. She never loved this man, but apparently, if you're a woman, you need a man!!!!! !<",

I almost didn't reply, but i figured fuck it let's see. I just said Hi. \n\nThen we talked, talked some more, we talked again. Suddenly we were talking all the time, & we decided to Skype. From Skyping, we decided to meet in person.  \n\nWe hung out, called ourselves friends but we were more than that. We tend to over think things, but truth is the matter was we were in love and a little dense about it. \n\nOn that front, maybe we were too logical bc while the feeling was there it just seemed too soon to be so. We confessed to it in less than 2 months. \n\nNow here we are 7.5 years later!",

I couldn't stand to be touched, and i was very shut down; I came from rough background. \n\nI had anxiety issues through the roof. Terrible relationships with both my parents, esp my own mother. \n\nThis woman showed me a great kindness. \n\nI moved away from my family for my mental wellbeing, but there was a lot i didn't know. From day one, she took time to sit down with me and help me figure out basic things like how to fill out a checkbook, as there was no one i could ask. \n\nWhen my anxiety reached its peak, I had one of the worst attacks of my life whilst driving on the fast lane home. At this point, i became terrified, and almost left my job but i NEEDED the pay. She completely took me off night shift so if it ever happened again, it wouldn't be in the dark. \n\nShe was always there for me whenever i needed an ear or advising. Even when i shortly went to another job, she supported me. She supported & nurtured my growth in the job i was in with her, never pressuring me and always giving me the chance to learn anything i wanted. She always brought stuff to work for me just because she happened to have been thinking of me. She gave me time off whenever i asked because i was overstressed & needed space from work to get my head together. \n\nI've become a much stronger person because of this. This person who was more of a mom to me than the one i had in the short time I've had her in my life. \n\nNot even a week ago, she ended up in the hospital bc of a clot in her lung.\n\nLast night she texted me she was finally home & SO glad because hospital beds \"sucks ass\". \n\nThis morning, upper management tells me they have bad news. \n\nShe had a stroke. \n\nAn hour ago, i received a phone call from her and i was SO RELIEVED and excitedly answered. \n\nIt was her daughter. \n\nShe had a few more strokes. She had to be airlifted, and by the time she got to the hospital there was a significant amount of dead tissue in her brain. DR estimates she might never talk again amongst other things. \n\nAnna - i might not get to tell you this, but thank you for everything. I love you so much. thanks for being a mom to me, and caring for me the way you did. I'm so heartbroken, and I'm scared of what's next. I just want you to be okay, and I'm glad that in our last phone call i was able to say I love you. I almost didn't."

It strongly compliments her current abilities with offensive fire magic and can up her confidence like you said, and having light mana could explain the visual differences in the simulacra in her introduction speech. \n\nIf there\u2019s no possibility she walked out with a foreign attunement, I\u2019d guess that she walked out with the Forgemaster attunement. Fire is its secondary mana type which would enhance her current offensive abilities and with the primary and tertiary mana types being earth and enhancement it basically makes her a pseudo shaper which could explain the new stuff she did with her simulacra in her introduction speech as well.",

Basically what I mean is, if you give me something, be it a bunch of objects, a very specific prompt, any type of data or whatever just SOMETHING i can easily create something new out of that and use my creativity. It just comes naturally. However, if you tell me to \"just think of something\" and create whatever I will not for the life of me be able to come up with anything. I was in creative therapy for a while and they never gave us assignments, they told us to basically just make whatever you feel like. It absolutely paralyzed me every single time and it made me believe I just wasn't creative for a while. But right now, I'm decorating my living room with a bunch of stuff I already have and it comes very easy to me to just go with the flow and make it work. It's just an example but do you get what I mean? I feel like it has to do with non linear thinking and decision paralysis that comes with adhd. You need to give me certain parameters i can work within and I'm gucci but make them too big and I will simply get overwhelmed and shut down. I hope this isn't too far off topic for this sub because I'm curious to see if other adhd'ers relate to this?"

It's normal to feel happy when someone compliments you of course but my brain takes it a step further. I will daydream about it and often time it also causes me to hyperfixate on that person...I honestly feel a bit embarrassed by it because I feel like I'm some big egomaniac when this happens, but I wonder if this could also be part of ADHD? Does this resonate with any of you? And if it does, have you found ways to handle these feelings in a healthier way? I don't like how it makes me so dependent on external validation."

What I mean by that is that whereas most kdramas out there portray their MLs as the typical macho/savior archetype, these shows appear to explore more egalitarian forms of relationship in terms of gender. Now in no way, shape or form am I saying these characters fail to reinforce gender roles in some way or another, but what I found is that they appear to genuinely respect/ value/ and encourage the FL's desires and quirks, ~~which I find to be extremely rare in kdramas~~.\n\nWith this in mind, what I'm looking for is a drama where the ML and FL mutually share power in the relationship. No damsel in distress bullshit, no childish games. Just two adults who happen to love each other and attempt to figure out how to be together in the midst of the adversities that come their way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some other shows I liked:**\n\nWhen the Camellia Blooms\n\nSomething in the Rain\n\nWeightlifting Fairy (A bit childish for my taste but still enjoyable)\n\nSecret Garden (edit: Not the best example of a ML with the healthiest sexuality but I'll still mention it because I like how the writers dealt with his character development)\n\nMoon Embracing the Sun\n\n**Not a huge fan of:**\n\nWhile you were sleeping (repetitive plot)\n\nFight For my Way\n\nStrong Woman Do Bong Soo (the comedy was just not for me)\n\nThe Heirs (PROBLEMATIC)\n\nReply 1994\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit -more info"

I'm considering other options after I get my CCC's.\n\nI see a number of people on here sharing such positive things about working home health.

My only gripe is that I can't use it in public because I'll look like a crackhead.\n\nI'd like a new stealthy vape to use around campus to vape CBD bud. I get a lot of paralysing anxiety and get pretty panicky whilst studying and I'd like to be able to take a break to step outside of the library, have a few tokes and breathe, then head back in.\n\nI'd much rather not buy CBD pills or drops because it'll be harder to dose, takes a while for it to kick in (when I vape it, I feel it nearly instantly) and I've heard from others that they can still feel it in their system for days afterwards, which I don't like the sound of. I also don't want to have to carry a bottle everywhere. I'm quite clumsy and can imagine the bottle breaking or leaking inside my bag and I'd be \u00a340 out of pocket :( The bud is also pretty cheap, around a fiver for a g.\n\nI've been looking through this sub for recommendations for a while now, and I'm leaning towards a Fury Edge, but I can't find anything about a smell proof case. I'd hate to be talking to a lecturer and all they can smell is weed :(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Price Range:** no more than \u00a3150 (I'm hoping to get some black friday deals tho)\n\n**# of Participants:** 1\n\n**Toking Routine:** I want to be able toke sporadically throughout the day\n\n**Extraction Speed:** I don't want to wait more than a couple of minutes for it to heat up.\n\n**Environment/Form:** Something portable, stealthy and battery powered as I'll be mainly using it around campus. I don't mind people seeing me vape as it's pretty common, I just don't want to look like I'm smoking crack cocaine on my study break. Ideally it can fit into my pocket with the case like the Dynavap but I don't mind the size\n\n**Vape Experience:** Dynavap 2018 M\n\n**Personal Requests:** has a smell proof case. I also like the idea of pods\n\n**Location:** UK"

But in this situation you weren't ready and neither was she and that's an awful way to be found out. I'll be wishing you luck- it's expected for these situations to feel scary and awful; I just wish she realized that her way of dealing with it won't really help and will only make you more anxious. While she may be watching and hovering over you for now (only time will tell if that's true, though) she can't continue forever. Even if she doesn't forget, you'll be at peace without her trying to force help methods which don't work on you. I'm not really the best with these kind of posts, but I really just hope that she doesn't make things harder on you and that she won't follow through with anything that will only hurt you <33",

I did want to stay so I complied and took down those cameras.  \n\nIn the past 2-3 months, someone or maybe several people have been allowing their dog(s) to relieve itself 1-5 feet from my ground level patio and then leaving it there.

I did my best to check the footnoted sources though, so hopefully I'm not using any false information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Zahad:**\n\nI think that there are three possibilities.\n\n1. Golden November (personally, I think this is the most likely)\n   1. It's the only S rank weapon\n   2. Jahad has yellow hair, which could be called gold. Gold is also symbolic of power, royalty, and first place\n   3. It currently belongs to Adori Jahad. She is the most powerful and beautiful princess and she commands Jahad's Army. If anyone were to be given the weapon that was originally meant for Jahad, it would probably be her. (But, it could also have been given to her because she has golden hair - from what we've seen, many princesses match their 13 month weapons. We also don't know when she was given the Golden November. So while I think this point is well worth mentioning, it could be moot).\n2. Rainbow Undecimber \n   1. It's unique among the 13 month series as the only non-weapon (well, only as far as we know. I couldn't find any confirmed statement that it's the only non-weapon, it might just be the only one we know of so far)\n   2. It represents all the colors (although there are other weapons like Luminous June that aren't a single color)\n3. Yellow May\n   1. My only reasoning is that it's yellow and Jahad has yellow hair. I think it's very unlikely this one was meant for him, but I thought I should at least mention it\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Arie Hon:**\n\n1. Silver January\n   1. Arie Hon has white hair, which could also be called silver\n   2. Similar to gold, silver is symbolic of power. It's also symbolic of second place, and of the Great Warriors, Arie Hon is second only to Jahad\n2. White February\n   1. Arie Hon has white hair\n3. Luminous June\n   1. It and the Red October are the only swords of the 13 month series. It would make sense that the 13 month intended for Arie Hon is a sword.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ari Han:**\n\nWe know almost nothing of Ari Han, so this part is especially questionable. But we do know that the Ari family is related to the Arie family, so there's a chance that Ari han has white hair like Arie Hon.\n\n1. Silver January/White February\n   1. Arie Han might have white hair\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ha Yurin:**\n\n1. Black March\n   1. She apparently looks a lot like Yuri, so she also has black hair\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Khun Eduan:**\n\n1. Blue August\n   1. He has blue hair\n2. Indigo July\n   1. He has blue hair (although I think Blue August is more likely because neither his hair or eyes are indigo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tu Perie Tperie:**\n\n1. Luminous June\n   1. He's the first light bearer in the tower\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Eurasia Blossom:**\n\nNot a lot is know about her appearance, but many of the known people in the Eurasia family have red or pink hair, so she likely has red or pink hair too\n\n1. Red October\n   1. She might have red hair\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Po Bidau Gustang:**\n\n1. Dark September\n   1. He has a standoffish personality and doesn't get along easily with others. He also seems to be pretty manipulative and scheming. My reasoning for this one is pretty weak lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hendo Lok Bloodmadder:**\n\nThere is very little known about him so far, but I have one idea\n\n1. Rainbow Undecimber\n   1. It's an inventory, and Bloodmadder is a defender. But my reasoning here is also super weak\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Yeon Hana:**\n\nThere isn't much information about her either. I can't even look at members of her family for reference because none of them are biologically related to her :')\n\n1. Luminous June\n   1. She is said to be the most beautiful of the great warriors\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lo Po Bia Traumerei:**\n\n1. Green April\n   1. Traumerei has green hair\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Arlen Grace:**\n\n1. Luminous June (new drinking game: take a shot for every time Luminous June was mentioned in this post)\n   1. Jahad had (has?) a huge crush on Arlene, so the \"luminous\" weapon being meant for her seems somewhat fitting\n   2. She got along well with everybody, so she probably had a \"bright\" or \"luminous\" personality\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**V:**\n\n1. Dark September\n   1. Po Bidau Gustang really didn't like V for some reason\n   2. Was described as being opposite to the rest of the great warriors in a way, since he became more interested in residents of the tower as the great warriors became more indifferent.\n   3. Parallels nicely with Luminous June if it was really meant for Arlen (all of these points are a stretch)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nJahad: Golden November, Rainbow Undecimber, or Yellow May\n\nArie Hon: Silver January, White February, or Luminous June\n\nAri Han: Silver January or White February\n\nHa Yurin: Black March\n\nKhun Eduan: Blue August or Indigo July\n\nTu Perie Tperie: Luminous June\n\nEurasia Blossom: Red October\n\nPo Bidau Gustang: Dark September\n\nHendo Lok Bloodmadder: Rainbow Undecimber\n\nYeon Hana: Luminous June\n\nLo Po Bia Traumerei: Green April\n\nArlen Grace: Luminous June\n\nV: Dark September\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this turned into a Luminous June appreciation post...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer:\n\n1. This post is a LOT of speculation, I'm not confident in most of what I said\n2. I'm not actually caught up with the story yet. I'm still in the floor of death arc, right after the Hell Joe fight and Gustang's appearance. And because of that I might have not yet learned some useful tidbits of information that aren't mentioned on the wiki. I do like to keep away from spoilers, but soon after starting TOG my curiosity about the lore overrode that. So while I was fine spoiling myself on parts of the story for this post, please be a little cautious with spoiler-marking your comments (I'll also be careful when reading the comments - if there are any lol)"

                "body": "I've been getting into haircare. Not much, just being gentler on my hair + recently started doing weekly hair oil (with jojoba oil) + leave in conditioner. My hair is definitely much softer and shinier now.\n\nI put the oil on all my hair, scalp, middle, and ends, and then leave it for an hour or two. I'm heavy handed with product and so my hair ends up looking like those over-gelled men's styles lol. For my scalp + the rest of my hair, I end up using maybe around a few tablespoons?\n\nSo I've got two questions regarding hair oiling:\n\n1. Is this a normal amount of oil to apply to my hair? (just below shoulders, thin, slightly wavy hair btw) I know that over moisturizing your hair can lead to hair loss, but since this is a wash out, once a week thing, is that a concern? Is it possible to use too much hair oil in this case?\n2. Is jojoba oil good to use for hair? What I've read (not much admittedly) says that it is, plus I use it for my nails so it's always nice to kill two birds with one stone, but it can't hurt to get more opinions."

But we've seen so little of dendro that it's hard to guess what its specialty might be. So I have two theories. The first one comes from looking at each element's themes/the stats that are commonly associated with each.\n\nAnemo - Crowd control/elemental mastery\n\nGeo - Shielding/DEF (Zhongli breaks the mold here by scaling off HP, but his kit is still focused on shielding and almost everything else about geo is DEF based) \n\nHydro - Healing/HP\n\nCryo - Crit rate (this one is a little questionable, but things like Rosaria's passive, the blizzard strayer set, cryo resonance, Kaeya c1, etc... strongly point towards cryo being crit rate themed)\n\nPyro - ATK (also a little questionable because of how general it is, but looking at pyro resonance and the overall offense theme of pyro makes atk the most likely option.)\n\nElectro - Energy recharge\n\nBased on this, there's one important stat left, crit damage. So I think that dendro might have a focus on crit damage\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy other theory comes from the few dendro enemies we have. The dendro samachurls create plant constructs, and dendro slimes hide in the ground. Both of these enemies make it hard to attack them. So I think dendro might be construct themed, or generally some kind of hiding/avoidance mechanism."

I haven't read either book in around a year I think, so my memory is going to be a bit fuzzy, but the feeling I got from most of his chapters was \"yeah I suck but I... don't really care. It's not my fault I suck. Or maybe it is, but I won't think about that.\" By Rhythm of War, he seemed to stop blaming others (if my memory serves me right) and accepted that his actions were his own fault, but even then he didn't care. It makes his chapters really enjoyable because he's so unique."

I have a combination of Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Fibromyalgia, Costochondritis, Hidradenitis Suppurativa, Vestibular Dysfunction, and congenital defects to my patella and tibia that cause a leg length discrepancy that should have been treated when I was a child and now has my pelvis and spine bent from compensating. AS affects my chest and arms so a manual wheelchair wouldn\u2019t work, and a folding electric wheelchair suits my needs best for times I need to go places that involve more walking than I can handle. I live in a house with stairs at the front door, and I own a very small car, so this will fit in my back seat and can be pulled out and unfolded open relatively easily. I currently do the same with my rollator walker. \n\nI already sent two pairs of shoes to an orthotic shoe shop to have sole lifts and ankle stabilizing wedges installed. Along with the wheelchair and orthotics, I need a few smaller items like a new heat pad, sunscreen and masks (skin cancer and covid protection while on immunosuppressants), and forearm crutches. Insurance should cover my Humira injections, though the first dose will cost my whole deductible in January. \n\n[proof of Humira prescription and shoe modification order by pt & physician](https://imgur.com/gallery/oqVUgWJ)\n\n[The type of wheelchair I\u2019m looking to get.](https://www.amazon.com/Forcemech-Navigator-XL-Electric-Wheelchair/dp/B01N0207SR)"

Nowadays I have a ton of hypertrophic scarring under my boobs and every time I have the tiniest flare, I go on antibiotics for 2-6 months. Turns out it can be a precursor to AS. \n\nSo my new rheumatologist immediately follows it with \u201chas anyone suggested ankylosing spondylitis?\u201d I tell him I have! But doctors all dismissed it due to hypermobility. He asks if I have morning stiffness. My bones are stiff for over an hour just from sitting for an hour. I wake up every morning basically solidified in what position I fell asleep in. Sometimes I need help moving my arms and legs just so I can leave the bed. Exercise loosens me up and thanks to EDS that means I walk with a cane to minimize fall risk. \n\nSo he\u2019s actually doing more tests! I\u2019m so excited to be heard.

Sometimes it takes a couple tries to find the right match for your therapist, and when you do it creates a great connection. On the other hand, if you\u2019ve already had a good connection with your current therapist, you can let them know what you think won\u2019t help you or won\u2019t be feasible and see if they have other methods. They\u2019re there to help you, and it\u2019s possible to be flexible. And if they have no other way to help you, in my experience, past therapists have offered to connect me to their colleagues to help me find that perfect match.\n\nGood luck out there!",

My whole life I\u2019ve been surrounded by straight peers and have had the same friends since high school. I\u2019ve also had the same, very supportive boyfriend since we were 16.\n\nWhen I made my new friend at work, we immediately clicked. He was the first friend I\u2019d made since high school and we bonded over his questioning sexuality and my comfort in my own. He\u2019s unsure if he\u2019s asexual, bisexual, or gay. I seriously felt like my whole world opened up when we met. All the gender norms, the way I view sexuality, it felt changed and so much more comforting. I never felt completely comfortable expressing my bisexual side to my friends because I felt like they didn\u2019t quite get it.\n\nThe problem is that possibly because he is a man and I\u2019m a woman, especially one who has a boyfriend, there are certain things people have expressed discomfort towards. So many of our friend tendencies and outings feel taboo\u2014 talking/joking about sex, going out doing things other than just grabbing lunch, spending whole days together. We both know it\u2019s completely platonic and we both really enjoy each other\u2019s presence. I can\u2019t help but feel annoyed that if he was a woman, people wouldn\u2019t bat an eye.\n\nMy boyfriend himself has expressed discomfort towards our friendship and I\u2019m working on setting boundaries to help his comfort. But I really do feel that I\u2019ve met a soulmate in some form, and regardless of whether we hangout differently or talk less, me feeling that close won\u2019t change and I don\u2019t want it to. I don\u2019t want to deceive my boyfriend. Are these friendships normal? Am I wrong to have such a close friendship?"

She would always courage me to hurt people and hurt myself while Amane ask her to stop. I just remember her yesterday and i want to meet her because actually, even she said bad stuff to me and said that she's going to kill me, i didn't really take it seriously like Amane did. So, i ask him about her and where she is. And he said that he locked her up. I was so shock and immedietly contact the gatekeeper. And they said they will take a look.

However, they are absolutely traits of a \"man\". Why? It's because they are *societal expectations* of a man, i.e. *social constructs*.\n\nSocial constructs don't mean that \"man\" doesn't exist or that it's a figment of the collective imagination. It just puts the correct terms in the correct boxes.\n\nIt also says that since what makes a man a man is defined by these societal expectations, nobody is born *a priori, naturally* locked into being a man or otherwise. It means that as long as you fulfill those societal expectations you are a man, and if you feel that you identify more as a man you can be a man.\n\nOn top of it, you won't find a satisfactory definition of \"male\" using physical references only, as well. Just about anything you think of can and will find exceptions, this has been a topic of research for *years* and I doubt that any odd folk on the internet has the answer.",

And therefore, you can never be sure that anybody who speaks Chinese actually understands Chinese; if the person in the Chinese room did actually understand it, it would be completely undistinguishable from a case where the person does not.

(Note: I have a few years experience with 3D, but it's mostly editing meshes/texturing, and when it comes to Blender, I know very little.)\n\nI'm trying to model a bow to use in a project and to save myself some time, created a part of the mesh in Microsoft's Paint 3D. (exported as .fbx) However, every time I do this, the imported mesh has a strange shine to it? As you can see in the pic, the center part, modeled in Blender, is much more... matte. This doesn't seem to affect how the texture shows up or anything else, but it makes me wonder if I should try and remove the shine.\n\nI compared the properties of both objects - the specular has the same intensity & was set to the same colour, everything else is the same (except mirror reflectivity - the Blender mesh has the value set on -1; I tried making them the same, didn't help).\n\nHas anyone encountered something similar?

While I was searching  a basket full of gemstones to see if any speaks to me (I was particularly drawn to purple coloured ones), I came across this one. Normally, it wouldn't appeal to me, but after holding it for a while and putting it back, suddenly I had this urge not to leave it there; something told me it wouldn't be good. This happens when a crystal chooses its owner isn' t it? It was the first time that happened to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell anyway, what baffles me is the purple side of the stone. (Later, I took a closer look on the brown side and turned out it was a Tiger's Eye. Never expected it would end up in my collection in a way like that.) **Do you guys have any tips what kind of mineral could that be?** Assuming that the stone is manmade, I thought it could be an error in the manufacturing process. I did a quick research to find out whether they create synthetic Tiger's Eyes from another minerals (like the case with turquoise and howlite), but couldn't find anything.\n\n*What's interesting, when you type \"pink Tiger's Eye\" into Google, the search does show pictures of it*, but mostly in form of bracelets. *However, there are no websites specialized in crystals that mention this one.* There was only one link to such a website: [https://www.gemstone7.com/437-pink-tigers-eye.html](https://www.gemstone7.com/437-pink-tigers-eye.html) It doesn't look too... polished though.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfk8yctiv8j31.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=87c11769b8cb1fbca03b4b01cfc9d0fa9a0b05f0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The brown side, this photo captured its beauty really well!](https://preview.redd.it/5igab22gx8j31.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=db1f16e01a70e9b0431aa889dfd9e42ca03ef2b8)"

                "body": "I would like to share an insight on the various spirit guides that every person has, according to what I've learned throughout my experience as a psychic medium and conversations with spirits. Felt called to post this after meeting so many people, while doing readings online, who were pretty clueless or confused or had many misconceptions on the matter. So let's get into this! \n\n**Ancestors**: Everyone has these, usually your close relatives, but can also be far. They stay with you from their departure until your very last moment or until you need them. Their energy and personality matches what you've gotten to know in life. Some are very talkative, others are more of observers. In my experience, they love hugging me as I talk to their humans. Sometimes they have regrets or things they wished they had done more in life. Connecting with them always becomes deeply emotional even for me.\n\n**Human spirits**: Everyone has these, they are souls you have never met in this life but most definitely in past ones. Most of the times they are souls with which you have a bond and often times in the past you might have had inverted roles: they living and you guiding. They take on a name and identity to present themselves that best match what the person needs. They are the most common spirits to come forward during readings. \n\n**Gods**: Everyone has these, but they are temporary and they hardly come forward during readings unless the person is open to knowing about them. They are gods and goddesses from all known mythologies and they usually approach a person to guide them through a certain period of their life, then they leave. Very energetic beings with the clearest communication. For example, I once encountered greek goddess Aphrodite, who was close to someone to help them through a particular rough period of their life, and I got the most empowering, fitting and accurate message ever. Such an incredible experience even for me! \n\n**Angels**: All that I've said about gods applies equally to angels as well. It's most possible, though, for them to come forward under a different identity that matches what feels approachable and not scary for the person. Gods don't do this, they either come forward or they don't. For example, I've known angel Gabriel to come forward as a woman.\n\n**Demons**: All I've said about gods applies equally to demons as well. If anything, they are very aware of the cultural misconception labelling them as evil, so they are way more rare to come forward. They usually don't do it unless the person is already somewhat knowledgable on the matter. Incidentally, demons aren't good nor evil, and everyone has at least one demon guide to go through the various phases of their life. \n\n**Guardians**: Not everyone has these. They aren't spiritual guides, exactly, but more of protectors or guardians. They can take the forms of people or of animals and would remain close to their person throughout their life, maybe giving some nudges of their presence here and there if the person is ready to know about it. They don't come forward in readings by themselves unless called.\n\n**Animals**: The concept is very similar to guardians, with the difference that they can't get a human form and don't speak in words but through energies and concepts. They usually are your deceased pets. They don't come forward in readings by themselves unless called.\n\n**Aliens**: Very rare, only met one person who had such spiritual guides. They are highly spiritual beings existing on a different plane and sometimes approaching humans to oversee or assist them. They provide great life advice and can even have strong personalities. They don't come forward in readings by themselves.\n\nOne aspect that all of these spirit guides have in common is to make sure in an absolute way that they won't scare or create discomfort in their human. They are loving, protective and extremely motivated in delivering the right messages whenever they have an occasion. Mainly mentioning this in case you find the idea of having demons or gods spirit guides upsetting. Know that they are creatures of love when they come forward to guide and will do anything to make sure they aren't scaring you! If you aren't absolutely ready, in fact, they simply won't reveal themselves.\n\nSomething else that I've learned is that none of the aforementioned spirits (maybe an exception for ancestors) are either good or evil. Spirit attacks and such negative experiences can come from any of them, but not when they are your spirit guides, and neither because they are evil, really, but simply because they're carrying out what is set for your soul's joruney to experience.\n\nThis is just a little part of what I've learned through readings and, generally, conversing with such diverse beings. You are free to believe differently and I'm open to any questions!\n\nBri"

I was just watching bootlegs of Broadway shows during covid and I just should\u2019ve watched anything but this. I fucking hate how she gets her hopes up so high, singing about how he\u2019s going to come back for her even though it\u2019s been three fucking years. Like I used to have so much faith in people myself but I just ended up getting shitted on my entire life, just like her. So I learned that if you get your hopes up too high or have faith in people, they\u2019ll shit on you and people shouldn\u2019t be trusted. \n\nNow, I\u2019ve been with my bf for almost 4 years and he\u2019s always been sweet and loyal to me and I love being with him but I can\u2019t help but think that sooner or later he\u2019s gonna do the same. There\u2019s always a part of me that thinks if he does, I\u2019m just gonna tell myself \u2018I told you so\u2019. I hurt him every time I tell him this but I can\u2019t help but believe it. Even on social media people talk about how they\u2019ve been betrayed by their SOs, plus this one lady I was talking to told me about how she went through several toxic marriages and that marriage changes them and gives them an opportunity to control you.  So yeah, people are shit. Even if they are good to you, sooner or later they\u2019re just gonna be shit too. \n\nSo naturally I\u2019m just like, fuck it why not just throw it all away?"

You may skip the context, as it's vent-ish, and just answer the question.\n\nFor context, we have this really big project at my uni, -it's about %70 percent of my grade- and we need to turn in our current progress tomorrow. We would be edting the video right now if one of my classmates' mom wasn't watching a concert on his computer. When I learnt this, I told our other editors (I manage the whole project, so it's my job) that videos to edit may come really late tonight or at worst, really early tomorrow. One of them said ''alright, chill, keep me posted'' and the other one was simply relieved this was due tomorrow, and not due today. On my side, I was *freaking out*, because it didn't seem like we had a full 26hs left, it seemed like 2, and I was already trying to get some work done by pure visual memory noting down how many seconds which scene was meant to be which was honestly kinda dumb. Basically, I felt powerless, so I literally tried to micromanage the seconds in a video. The s*econds.*\n\nNot the greatest example, I know, but my point stands; Does this happen to you? Do you do the opposite? How stressed do you need to be for it to happen? Is it the first thing you fall back to when things go south, or is it the last possible resource? Have you ever tried to micromanage *others?* Do you want a hug?"

                "body": "So let me start with this, I never intended to study International Relations or anything related to humanities, but it just happened. \n\nOkay, so for the past 4-5 years of my life, I have involved myself with a lot of STEM-related subjects, competitions, programs, courses, etc. I was planning to study engineering/science or just Applied/Pure Mathematics (since I was a participant at the IMO). But, I also have a good aptitude for politics and diplomacy. \n\nSince I'm reliant on government support, I had to change direction to attain the funding needed to study abroad. I can't change my major because of that, and if I try, I'm risking my whole financial backing/tuition. \n\nAnyway, I have come to realize that I seriously loathe the method of studying humanities. The reading, note-taking, revising I have to do is so boring and tedious compared to how I studied my other subjects, aka, through problem-solving and abstraction. I feel like all I'm doing right now is filling myself with information to regurgitate it onto some type of paper/presentation and then partially forget it. \n\nI'm also the type of person who doesn't memorize things for a long time; I rigorously studied chemistry (organic chemistry too), and I practically forgot everything about it, even though I was really good at it. \n\nAll of this is really affecting my academic life, and I hate it. I can't get the energy/motivation to leave the house to go to uni. I don't want to open Google Classroom or anything related to university since all it brings is negative emotions. I'm scathing by, but I don't know for how long I'll be able to do this. I hate everything about this, and it feels awful that I can't do anything about it. \n\nI also made the stupid mistake of studying in an institute instead of a university, so my transfer options are severely limited. I can study economics, but I don't find it as fun as engineering or the sciences (and it's a social science, so I'm not really keen on that :/).\n\nI'm a big fan of psychology, sociology, and the social sciences in general, but I don't see myself being a scholar/academic of such fields due to the way they are studied. As a goal-oriented person, and my goals normally come from within, I don't like goals imposed on me. I always love to discover the truth, and that's just how I am. I'll keep digging till I get to the true essence of a thing/subject/matter.\n\nBasically, I can't handle how people study the humanities as I find it frustrating and tedious, and I want a way out. Any suggestions? (If you just came down here for a TL;DR, then scroll back up.)"

Hard point spawns pick one or two set locations on the map for each team relative to where the hard point is. You will spawn there no matter what. This never happened in old hard point on BOII for example.\n\n2019 also tried to give safe spawn areas in the very back of the map for each team.

So I've picked up a thing or two to say the least. I also love to see new players get into the game and hope they get past the initial hump of being a noob.

I wouldn't try it yet if you're not fully comfortable with the movement yet. I've been playing CoD, well, forever and it took me a while to get good at being accurate while jump-shooting.\n\nIn my opinion, going prone is a good counter to the jump shot. It makes the Jumper's target even smaller to hit and it may be easier for the prone player to aim higher and hit the chest or even the head of the jumper. Also, keep your distance from the corner if you're expecting someone to jump around it. It's harder to rotate from the inside out than to rotate around a target. Think of Genghis Khan firing arrows from horseback, surrounding a target vs the target trying to shoot Genghis Khan circling him on a horse. Khan has the easier shot because he is moving around his target while the target stays mostly still. That's why moving around your opponent and shooting is a good tactic.",

The timing just means how long it takes to look down your sights or look into your scope. A shorter time is better for you as you will be ready to aim and shoot your opponent.\n\nThe advantage to the jump shot is that when you jump into the air, your feet are at chest level. So, if both players take damage, the jump-shooter wins the exchange because he shot for the body but the opponent waiting was aiming at chest height but ended up hitting his feet. Also, it allows you to keep some momentum when moving. Moving targets are harder to hit that stationary ones. That's why you see other players twitching around and inputting ridiculous button combinations to avoid getting hit while moving as fast as they can.",

I say \"on Xbox\" because I believe PS has the option to turn it off but I may be wrong. What makes me even more upset is that this was a feature in the beta. A feature that has been removed with no explanation.\n\nI would say this wouldn't seem so important but the game refuses to actually match by input and just puts me up against m&k users and cheaters. So the feature is necessary for normal play. And I don't want to hear that the pool on Xbox is too small. PS is 3:1 on Xbox and this game sold a MINIMUM of 16 million copies in the first week, so give me my feature back. Especially if it's only an option on PS.\n\nThe second feature is a bug and I have seen actually zero notice of. On Xbox, when in a party, it is impossible to edit your custom classes as a guest (meaning not the party leader) because the game will display your Warzone classes instead. This bug has been present since DAY 1 and is entirely unknown to the devs. There has been no mention in the mega-thread and no post on the Trello board. Thus, it may never get fixed unless this sub recognizes its existence.\n\nPlease, if you could upvote this post to get it noticed, then maybe my experience on Xbox will be fixed someday."

In addition to the new maps and modes we have lined-up for Weekend Two, we also have some changes (and new things we are trying) that we\u2019ll be sharing with you this week.\n\nThroughout Weekend One, we played the game, watched the game being played, read your feedback, and talked to many of you.\n\n At a high-level, leading into Weekend Two we:\n\nFixed various crashes\nAddressed a few game-play exploits\nPatched some map geo and lighting issues\nUpdated progression for some Gunsmith related bugs\nHere are some things we have heard from you on:\nMini-Map Dot Rules\nCurrently in the MW2 Beta, we only show enemy player dots when a UAV is active. The design reason for this is that we do not want to punish players for firing their weapons. We also want players to actively search out the origin of a gunshot versus just traveling directly to where the dot is on the mini-map. We continue to gather feedback on how the game is playing in regards to this topic.\nTarget Tracking\n\nWe\u2019ve seen feedback that it is hard to track targets once you get into a firefight. We agree this is an issue and we have changes incoming to reduce muzzle smoke opacity and to increase the visibility of the muzzle flash to help engage someone who is firing at you. These changes should help with tracking your opponents in combat.\nWe are also investigating more ways to visually differentiate Enemies and Friendlies outside of the standard nameplates above heads of the opposing players. We will be trying a few changes in Weekend Two\u2026 more on that later this week.\nUser Interface\nWe\u2019ve seen the feedback around difficulty editing perk packages, managing loadouts and accessing the armory. We have identified some UX issues as well as some bugs\u2013 these are things we won\u2019t be able to adjust in time for Beta Weekend Two, but they are top of mind ahead of launch.\nPerks\n\nWe\u2019ve seen varied feedback on the Perk Package system. Some players love it and others feel it\u2019s an unnecessary departure from the original system. We feel it\u2019s a nice shake up to how perks work and to the general progression of a match. We\u2019ve also balanced the ultimate perks to be more powerful as you earn them later in the match. We\u2019ll continue testing throughout Beta Weekend Two, including drastically accelerating the earn rate of these to see how players react. Our goal remains improving the flow of all perks ahead of launch.\nDead Silence is another hot topic as many players have expressed that they would like to see it as a Perk instead of a Field Upgrade. We believe it is important to game health that rushers are not able to move at high speeds without consequence. Dead Silence as a Field Upgrade creates a balance between freedom of movement and predictability of combat.\nFootsteps\n\nFootstep audio in week one of the MP Beta was very high, giving players long distance directional information about enemies. For Weekend Two we have some changes coming in. We are reducing the range of footstep audio for the various player movement states (jog, sprint and tactical sprint). This will help soften the cost of moving around the map. The second change is that enemy and friendly footsteps are now distinct. This should help players better understand what's going on as things move around on the battlefield. More details to follow.\nSlides\n\nSentiment around the removal of slide-canceling remains positive. We are aware of the workaround and are contemplating how to handle it for Weekend Two of the beta. Additionally, we have some other slide changes for launch which will make this movement feel a bit more fluid and snappy.\""

                "body": "You guys do realize that the reason they made dead silence a field upgrade and not a perk was because they were trying to eliminate crutch perks from Call of Duty like the infamous Toughness, Stopping Power, and Blast Suppressor?\n\nCrutch perks take away player choice and define a meta where you feel like you HAVE to equip a perk to not be at a disadvantage. Picking perks is all about trade-off. You give up all the other perks in a slot for the one you choose. Having Dead Silence as a perk is invaluable. I went back and played the old CoDs, and the Ninja/Dead Silence value is insane. Especially when compared to other perk 3's. The perk 3's are usually the weakest group, minus Dead Silence/Ninja. So the stealth option is a must pick, even if your class doesn't necessarily care about stealth. Having another sensory cue to identify where an enemy is at is valuable, so much so that taking it away entirely, at every life, is way more of a detriment that'll say, if the enemy sees your claymore through a wall, for example.\n\nWe want choice in our custom classes, right? We want a generally balanced game where everything has a niche utility, right? We don't want to play a game that prides itself on customization and feel like there are only a few number of effective choices right?\n\nI want all of that, and it shocks me how much the community wanted this perk back and forgot the history of how crutch perks ruined CoD customization. Like I literally remembered seeing 5 total players NOT using Blast Suppressor in AW during the entire game's life! Literally 5! (SBMM was heavily heightened for this CoD because of the advanced movement.) But still!\n\nI think, as a field upgrade, Dead Silence was better than if it was a perk (although it felt like a clutch field upgrade but that's another story.) I hope IW remains solid on their design principles for this next installment. Because sometimes the community doesn't know best."

I'm going to have to think of new possibilities for the parts I don't know and pick which one seems the best based on what Fe-Ti thinks.\"*\n\nBasically, my Si guides me down a path, my Fe influences how I feel about a situation, and my Ti makes the final call. And Ne is on emergency call usually when Si can't step up.\n\nWhen I don't have a lot of experience to rely on, my Ne comes and pairs up with Si to fill in the gaps and Fe-Ti supports. So it temporarily looks like (Si+Ne)-Fe-Ti.\n\nWhat about you guys?"

Self-growth is a huge part of my life and I believe that you will never stop growing and improving. I grew up with a fiery ESFJ mother who often wished I was more like my ENxx cousins so that I could be successful, and that desire from her for me to be successful certainly influenced me.\n\nBut as an ISFJ, it's a bit difficult because of my natural tendencies, plus being shy. I'm doing okay so far; I've understood that no one is scrutinizing me and sees only what I put out. So I try to put out as much confidence and initiative as I can, despite how nervous it makes me on the inside. Anyway, I'd love to learn from you guys how someone like me can grow and improve.\n\nI'm overall delighted there's a sub that's a tad bit more serious and filled with interesting and engaging topics. I'm truly looking forward to interacting with you guys as I have a list of my own topics I'd like to discuss with people but usually am unable to find the right people to engage with. Also my ENTP SO is a busy bee so I don't like bothering him too much when he has important things to do.\n\nAnyway, hello to everyone and I'm looking forward to seeing what sort of topics people bring up here!

                "body": "She's people-oriented, she is a great host and likes helping other people. I think she's a bit unhealthy due to her often complaining to me that other people don't reciprocate her kindness though. She takes pity on people easily and always wants to help someone in need out. Very kind and has helped my boyfriend a lot willingly when he was struggling. She cooked him lots of food many times and gave them to me to pass on to him. \n\nShe cares a lot about what other people think, to the point my ISTP dad and I get annoyed about it. It's only annoying to me when she cares on my behalf, even though I don't care. Like she wants me to get a job in the government because of the status. Or if we're going out to the community she gets mad if I don't wear something that'll wow others.\n\nShe likes to be her own boss and hates working under someone or being told what to do. She has this fiery motivation about her that reminds me of an ENTJ's. It's kind of aggressive in nature like \"if they can do it, why shouldn't I do it???\" She's always preaching to me how I should be smart and watch other people so I know what I can do too. She's a bit calculating too. Like \"I know you don't talk to her anymore, but just keep in touch you never know if you need her reference in the future.\" I think she's aware of how bad it sounds though because she always precedes it with \"I don't mean this in a manipulative way, but it's just for your benefit.\"\n\nShe and I (ISFJ) clash because of her drive for success for me. She wants me to be very successful, but that's not really the most important thing in my life. Though she has certainly influenced my way of thinking where I am definitely more hungry for success compared to other ISFJs. She gets angry when I don't act like she does in the motivated way (unhealthy part of her). She was the kid all the other parents would say \"look at her, be more like her.\" So she gets annoyed that I'm not like that. \n\nShe's very much someone who says \"lazy people don't succeed.\" When I'm with mom, I subconsciously feel like I have to always look like I'm doing something productive or else she'll start going off about how I'm wasting my time. I have a cousin and she used to get up at 6am to go work from 8am\u20136pm with weekends off. My mom once talked to me about her like \"what is she going to do with two days off?? She should go to work on one of the days or find another part time to make use of her time.\"\n\nShe's very emotion-driven from my experience. If she hears something, she reacts emotionally first before logic. For example, if she gets mad, she'll stay mad and defend her points even if it's unfair. She doesn't stop to think if she's being fair or logical. She comes off as a bit selfish in that way. Again, I do believe she's unhealthy. \n\nOnce she's into a topic, she is obsessed for days. Every free moment she has she'll be googling it and every time she wants to talk to you it's about said topic. She's also doesn't like planning. She's told me that she sucks at planning and prefers spontaneity. An example she gave me is she doesn't like planning when someone is going to come over for dinner a few days in advance. It stresses her out. She prefers if they just randomly said \"hey I'm coming over later for dinner.\" \n\nMy mom is very interested in interior design and how to make/save a lot of money. Oh, also anything related to people like gossip, news, etc. Otherwise, no interest in other topics. Movie-wise, she likes a good romance movie, political movie, or historical fiction. She doesn't understand the appeal of sci-fi or fantasy movies, which my dad and I love. It seems like she's solely interested in realistic things. \n\nMom said she was always popular in school, and she was always interested in fashion. She'd change her hairstyle every few months according to the trend and was very stylish. Even today reaching her mid-50s, my mom said that if she didn't have to worry about being seen in public by our community, she'd shave the bottom half of her head because it's too thick for her liking. Sometimes she'll randomly say \"My hair is getting annoying. I think I'm going to cut it today.\" And then just chop it off in the bathroom. To me, the word that comes to mind in this example is eccentric. \n\nThoughts?"

                "created_utc": 1603827560.0,
                "body": "Hello! I'd like help typing my best friend. We're long-distance friends for the better part of our friendship so I haven't been able to type her well just purely over video calls or texts. Her interest in MBTI was raised when she saw how accurate the descriptions were, but overall she's not invested in it so I don't want to push her to learn about cognitive functions to figure out what type she falls under.\n\nShe typed herself by the letters and got both ENFJ and ENFP. Reading the type summaries afterward didn't help much because she related to both strongly. I think she leans ENFP but I could be wrong. And for reference, I'm an ISFJ.\n\nFor starters, she's overall a very sweet girl. At high school, many guys were enamored by her innocent and sweet personality. She's what I would describe a cinnamon roll. In high school, she was able to befriend anyone and had a wide circle of different friend groups. So she's definitely a social butterfly, and, pre-COVID, she went out often with her party friends and traveled the world (she comes from a wealthy family). With all that, she was also a diligent student and still is at her graduate school. Academics and non-academics related, I find she definitely questions things before choosing to believe them.\n\nDuring her worst and unhealthy relationship, she was overly emotional. When she got mad at her ex boyfriend, she would yell at him and then block him on everything. It definitely caused him to end up lying to her about small things so she wouldn't get mad. She's in a much healthier relationship and is much more level-headed.\n\nBut I'd say she still kind of leads with her emotions. E.g., for me, most times my logical side wins me over more like \"I feel this way, but I know *this* is the right thing.\" Whereas with my best friend, I see her mentality as \"I know this is the right thing, but I still feel *this* way.\" She's very open-minded and isn't steadfast on her emotions, though, if someone tells her otherwise. She accepts it like \"No you're right, I shouldn't be like this.\" But only if they're right. If she fails to see how they're right, she'll stick to her points.\n\nAlong with that, she takes critique very well. Our communication is solid because we both have the mentality of \"it's not what you say, it's how you say it.\" If I tell her a harsh truth, she's incredibly receptive to it 100% of the time if it's said in a non-harsh way.\n\nShe's not an unsolicited advice giver but she still tries to help in a nice way? If I vent to her, she does seem to have the need to figure out why the situation happened or what not, but isn't necessarily an unsolicited advice giver. Her responses to my issues are often like \"Is it possible that he did this because of that?\" or \"what do you think you'll do?\" or \"did you talk to her about it?\" or \"maybe it would be best to write it down?\"\n\nWith her current boyfriend, she definitely pushes him to be the best him he can be and I see her more ambition-driven for them both. She's told me about how she wants him to be happy, but she also wants him to be better \u2014 and I can see the latter being more heavily emphasized. Essentially that he's mostly talk and no action.\n\nBest way I can describe it: For me, it's like I'm just a cheerleader and supporting/helping with whatever my partner decides. But my best friend is like a coach and actively pushing her SO toward what he wants.\n\nThere also was a moment between her and her SO that I think is kind of noteworthy. I don't remember the exact wording, but he was talking crap about how people who use others to get ahead in careers are scum, and my best friend said something along the lines of \"I get where he's coming from, but the reality is that this is what corporate places can be like. Not everything is fair in the job world.\" She seemed more realistic and grounded than her boyfriend.\n\nThat said, she is also into abstract ideas such as having a vision board, being a big believer in fate/destiny, believing (or at least questioning) supernatural things to be real. I can't pinpoint it, but overall she strikes me as a pondering, abstract person despite also being a realist.\n\nTo me, I don't see a lot of Si in her. She's not only forgotten many things I've told her several times, she also doesn't apply her past experiences to the present/future. She tackles a lot of problems she has or I have by analyzing the present, and it's usually me who solves our respective problems by relating to past experiences. Of course, I'm speaking as a Si user so I'm not sure if I'm judging her level of Si correctly. She could have average Si or weak Si. \n\nI think this also may be individual traits and not necessarily a type trait, but she seems a bit incapable of seeing things objectively from a different perspective when she's in a situation. There's been a few times where I helped her see things from someone else's point of view and she gets an epiphany about the whole conflict. If it's not a situation she's in, she's great at seeing things from other perspectives. I'm not sure if this is an indication of her emotions clouding her objective point of view, or if she's just not the best at it.\n\nI'm not sure if that helps at all. If anyone needs more answers, I'm happy to give them!\n\nEdit: the mixed responses below with great reasons are legit a reflection of my own thoughts in the past few weeks, haha."

                "body": "Firstly, I say ex, but really it was a \"situationship.\" It started off as a friends with benefit relationship, but it gradually evolved into something that felt like a relationship. He did things for me that I felt a boyfriend would do, but then verbally tell me that he didn't see me that way. I am an ISFJ, so I let this go on for like 4 years. Now, about him:\n\nHe's 28 or 29 male (can't remember too well now). He's a programmer and has always been interested in computer programming from the beginning. On his free time, he spends it gaming. He's an introvert for sure and only went out if it was with his core group of friends that he's had from high school/college time. Other than that, he could and would spend every night in his room. Also they all game together so there's a strong common interest. \n\nHe seemed very emotionally stable? I'm not sure what the word would be. It's not emotionless \u2014 more like he had a firm grasp of his emotions. I've never seen him be emotional, like angry or sad. It was always... consistently the same neutral self. In the four years I've known him, he's never been angry or really sad. He shed a few tears when he broke the news to me that he's going to have to move for work and we wouldn't be able to hang out again. Other than that, zilch. \n\nHe barely opened up to me. Everything we talked about was one of several rotating topics and I remember often feeling bored with our conversations. Looking back, he never had intimate moments with me where he'd open up about how he was feeling (whether that's because nothing really bothered him, or he was a private person).\n\nI find that he becomes very interested in a certain topic easily and fairly often, but then would drop it after a short while of executing. For example, he was really interested in philosophy one time, so he bought a bunch of text books, read one book for a week, and then essentially never touched it again. \n\nSpeaking of which, he seemed like an intellectual kind of person. He liked learning, and I remember on time I woke up from a nap to see he was eating canned beans and on a wikipedia page reading up on the type of beans he was eating. \n\nDespite that, his intellectual side did make him seem a bit conceited. Not overly! But it would come out every now and then. In fact, the thing that made me stop contacting him was due to this. When he was in his new work location, he was temporarily staying at his coworker's house with said coworker's wife and kids. And he one day opened up and told me how he didn't feel obligated to help his coworker out with house chores. I don't know if he had valid points, but to me he came off as sounding entitled and a little arrogant because he worked for a prestigious university. And that surprised me because I never saw that side in the four years I knew him. \n\nI think his love language is gift giving. I remember being pleasantly surprised to see how easily he'll buy a game for a friend randomly because they said they wanted it. For me, too, he bought me lots of things he thought I'd like or I mentioned was nice. \n\nHe also was quite touchy with me even non-sexually. He'd cuddle and hold me when we slept together, he'd playfully pinch my cheeks, and he seemed okay with me holding his arm when we were out walking. Thinking about it now, I don't know if he did all that not caring if it came off as very affectionate despite his lack of feelings toward me, *or* he doesn't view these gestures as intimate and emotional connections like I would. \n\nHe never was the type of person to call someone out unless it was absolutely necessary. If he felt someone could change, I think he was more the kind of person to say things that gently nudged the person rather than a full on \"you're being an ass here.\" \n\nHe, to me, seemed very confident and sure of himself in all aspects of his life, though he does say he did a lot of self-growth. He was a hypochondriac, but other than that no medical-related issues. He was a night-owl and there have been lots of days where he'd tell me he was awake all night gaming or programming and then he'll sleep for most of the day. \n\nI feel like his past relationship has affected his view on life. He had a long-term girlfriend who broke it off for a friend and eventually married shortly after. It's been many years since then, but he still is adamant on just focusing on his career and not getting into a relationship. \n\nI know I mentioned above a few times that it seemed like he's a private person, but I'd like to reiterate that here. To be fair, I'm unsure if him being private is just part of his personality or because he didn't view me as someone he could be intimate in that way with. Although, I will say we grew close and 4 years is a long while to build intimate trust with. Like I didn't find out his brother had a medical condition until close to the end of our weird 4 year long relationship.\n\nHe was very easygoing overall and we got along incredibly well. We both were even-tempered people with high tolerances. I don't know if this is enough, but please ask away if you guys have questions and I'll answer them! Thank you in advance."

                "body": "I had a really traumatic November. I was in a wreck and very badly broke bones in, both legs, my left arm and a small break in my hip. I had to have 4 bone surgeries in one week (one for my crushed elbow, a rod in my right leg, knee surgery in left knee and plates in my left ankle) and spent a month in the hospital just getting independent enough to go home with my family. It was the worst the worst pain of my life and I don\u2019t want to block it out because that\u2019s not healthy. But. I\u2019m getting really tired of being reminded of it every time I look at my legs or my ankle or put my elbow on a table. I\u2019m proud of my scars because they are physical proof that I battled my way through that absurdly hard time. \n\n\nBut can\u2019t it just disappear for a little bit?? I am nearly fully recovered now but the stupid scars are just stuck there, glaring at me. My skin will never be so smooth like it was. I\u2019m 19! My skin should still be smooth! I shouldn\u2019t be afraid of getting a tan! I should be able to sit on my knees! I shouldn\u2019t have to give airport security a \u201cmetal bones\u201d card! I shouldn\u2019t feel the need to explain myself when I want to wear shorts! I shouldn\u2019t have to do tricks to shave without cutting my scars! I shouldn\u2019t be scared of driving in a straight line! I finally get what people mean when they say they\u2019re sorry that I had to go through that a such a young age! It sucks! I\u2019m tired of this! I want to forget it ever happened, I want to not feel it anymore. \n\nI know that it\u2019s unhealthy to completely ignore traumatic events. I tried that, I had a panic attack in an x-ray room. I also know it\u2019s unhealthy to think about traumatic events all the time and these stupid scars are making it hard to regulate how much I think about it. \n\nAlso, the freaking x-ray room... I had two full-body x-rays in eight hours and completely blacked out the first one but the second one still hurts when I remember it. The break in my arm was the most directly painful one because the bone was so crushed they had to wash it out. The surgeon said it was like sand. But when I was in that x-ray room I felt everything. They had to move an x-ray plate under all the broken parts and they had to rotate them and it was the worst. I only felt the broken hip once (because it was the least severe) and it was in that x-ray room. \n\nThe next time I needed an x-ray, I had recovered pretty well. I was using a wheelchair and I didn\u2019t need to sing to get through the pain of moving. But getting an x-ray in that room brought me back and I just could not stop trembling. I had to focus on keeping one limb still at a time. \n\nThat was months ago but I\u2019m still not completely over it. \n\nI am a cheerful person and have a hard time venting to the people that I know. I have a hard time with telling my sister in law that I think my experience was way worse than childbirth. If I could replace breaking all those bones and having all this trauma with one 1-3 days of pain and a baby, I would. I think that five surgeries, months of painful recovery and emotional trauma are worse than birth. Whenever i complain about my accident she immediately compares it to when she had her baby. I appreciate that she is trying to relate and giving birth is a painful experience but I really don\u2019t want to compare them. I don\u2019t want to hear \u201ctry having a baby\u201d every time I talk about this trauma. She knew she was going to give birth months in advance, she had time to prepare. I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to me, I wasn\u2019t prepared. She was in the worst pain of her life for twelve hours and some bad discomfort for 1-2 weeks after. I was in the worst pain of my life in five separate instances over a week (not counting the times I\u2019ve blocked out), with really bad pain in-between. That was followed by bad pain for two weeks and I was blessed to only need extra-strength Tylenol for the months after that. After the worst pain of her life she was tired and had a baby. After the worst pain of my life, I couldn\u2019t walk or stand or get to the bathroom without help for six weeks and spent more months just painfully re-learning to walk and all I got from it was some ugly scars. Where\u2019s my freaking baby! If this is comparable to giving birth, where is my baby! Is my baby just my broken sense of security that I have to nurse back to health! I didn\u2019t get this huge upside! I didn\u2019t get anything good from this other than character building and a lot of unneeded fears and list of triggers that I have to avoid if I don\u2019t want to risk a flashback. \n\nOk, I think I\u2019m done. I have been thinking about saying this stuff all week. Thank goodness that there is a subreddit for venting. Also, I understand that giving birth is hard and I don\u2019t mean to make it sound like less than it is but I just am tired of being told that giving birth is worse than what I went through because I\u2019ve learned through all of this that comparing pain is a foolish endeavor and it\u2019s annoying to be constantly invalidated because someone wants to relate when they really can\u2019t. And it\u2019s okay that she can\u2019t relate, it doesn\u2019t bother me."

                "body": "TLDR at the end\n\n\nIn November I was in a car wreck that broke a lot of bones, put me in a lot of pain and stuck me in the hospital for a month. To be short, I had really bad breaks in both legs, my left arm and hip/pelvis. I needed five surgeries. I was in no state to finish my semester so my professors (very kindly) gave me an incomplete grade so I could recover and then finish my work when I was ready.\n\nBut, honestly, the thing that I was most afraid of was getting out of the hospital and completing the last month of the semester that I missed cause of the accident. Having those strict due dates is the only way I can get anything done and being told to take my time makes it REALLY hard to do anything at all. \n\nWhen I was in the hospital, the only thing that scared me more than having to self-manage work was a panic attack that I had during my four-week x-ray. I had gotten two full-body x-rays after the accident and they were so painful that being in the environment again made me feel it all over again. \n\nI\u2019m pretty much fully recovered now so I\u2019ve been ready to finish up my work for about a month but I\u2019ve been procrastinating finishing work Cause I have a REALLY hard time motivating without enforced deadlines and have a hard time breaking up work without help and a hard time remembering what I have to do without reminders and a hard time with getting too overwhelmed looking at a list of tasks etc. (a lot of the basic ADD struggles) All these things (and more) make incomplete class work feel like the tallest wall to climb. I learned to walk again after breaking both legs but self-managing schoolwork still manages to feel harder than that.\n\nI had been putting off contacting my history professor (the other professors had contacted me already) because of that paralyzing fear of having to tackle this stuff pretty much alone. I finally contacted him on Friday and he did the most beautiful thing. The students in this semester class are tackling the same chapters in the textbook that I need to complete and they have to do it online right now cause of a shelter-in-place order. \n\nHe just gave me the same deadlines and schedule as this semesters students. Everything is due at the end of each week and he will enforce that. I was sure he was just going to give me a huge list of tasks and expect me to be done by the set date and I was terrified but he didn\u2019t. Now I can do all these things according to the schedule that he sent me and I don\u2019t have to worry about putting it off for too long. Thank you so much mister history professor! Just having a week by week schedule to follow is so helpful and it is taking loads of weight off of my shoulders! Just yay!\n\nTLDR: I was in a really bad accident that made me miss the last month of my semester and I have back up work to do. I was worried that my ADD will make this really hard but my history professor gave me a week-by-week schedule to follow that is going to help so much, I didn\u2019t even have to ask!"

                "body": "I was really inclined to say YTA, but honestly maybe you're not. I was gonna say that maybe inviting, for example, 15/25 kids or whatever would be better since it doesn't look like you're excluding someone. However, if your daughter really wants to invite the whole class... Avery would still be a problem, I mean, she's making you change your plans, and you should be free to invite the whole class if you want. But if you know that Avery would ruin that if she was invited, than maybe it's actually better not to invite her. I believe your mindset is not \"I'm going to exclude the disabled kid\" but it's more like \"this person is always causing problems at school, and I know she's going to ruin my daughter's birthday, so I should avoid that\". The point is not her disability, the point is that, unfortunately, a kid is probably going to ruin your event. So yeah, harsh decision to make, but how the hell are you supposed to deal with that? Telling your daughter that she can't invite her classmates because Avery is going to be upset? Inviting Avery and potentially ruining the birthday? Either way, this Avery is interfering too much in your daughter's plans, and that's exactly what she didn't want to happen. So maybe you did the right choice, I don't think you could make a decision here that would be good for everyone. It sucks, but I don't know what you could do. Even if you invited her parents to take care of her, would they do that? If you don't know them, it's hard to tell. I know a lot of parents who don't give a fck about their kids ruining other people's stuff (and I also don't believe they would be the whole fcking party behind her watching what she's doing), so that would also be a risk. So... well, basically you can't please everyone, and technically it's not your job to make other people happy about your choices, and even though making this decision kinda sucks, and don't know how else you could handle that.

(again usually paid for by the man) \n\nthe thing is I was supposed to go on a date with a girl on a dating app and then she canceled on me last minute because her parents surprised her. I figured it was reasonable so we rescheduled for today. \n\nYesterday before the date I reminded her about our date today. She said \u201cyeah, but can we just meet there instead of have you pick me up?\u201d I figured it was no big deal so I agreed. Then she asked \u201ccan we make it a double date too?\u201d I felt a little annoyed cause the date is in a public place and I wasn\u2019t going to pick her up. We\u2019d never be alone together. But I tried to be patient and agreed. I asked \u201cwho would be the other couple?\u201d We ended up agreeing to set up a blind date with two of our friends to be the double.\n\nI called one of my best friends and felt really bad and hoped that he had an open schedule. Luckily he did. I let her know that I get why she is a little nervous cause it\u2019s a dating app and some men are nasty and horrible. \n\nToday she texted me to tell me that she was sick. This was in total the 5th canceled date I\u2019ve had this week. So I told her that Im not interested in taking her out now, because I usually give girls 1 chance if they cancel a date. I was just angry cause I even got a friend for the double. \n\nShe then continued to write a mean and sarcastic text thanking me for doing \u201cthe bare minimum\u201d! \n\nHow was that the bare minimum??? I texted her a day before to remind her. I planned the date. I had plans to pay for it all. I even put up with her nonsense requests cause she was paranoid and found another guy to make the date safer. I\u2019ve never with any girl and never planned on doing anything bad to her. \n\nWhere is this bare minimum she is talking about? \ud83d\ude02 where is the gratitude for the free food and date?"

I legit only call them to wish Happy Birthday (because why would they initiate that phone call when it's their B-Day? rofl) \n\nI always feel really bad because it probably comes across as me not caring for them, when that's not true at all, but that initial act is just so anxiety-inducing for me. After the call ends, I always feel relieved, but the anxiety starts all over again the next time I have to call them.\n\nIn contrast, I have absolutely no problem contacting anyone else; coworkers, and other people I need to contact for work. Those phone calls are completely fine for me, I can even stay on the phone for a long time, and it's not even all business either. I can talk to coworkers about personal things, like how they're doing/feeling all that stuff, complaining about things at work etc.\n\nAnyone else have the same problem?"

My college has mediocre degree programs and I'm worried if its poor quality will result problems in when I will be looking for a job. Idk how important my transcript and the classes that I took will be lol.\n\nBut we still can add or drop, register to any classes that we want and I was thinking of taking the same courses that students of Harvard or MIT take so that I would make sure that my degree program will be acceptable. Oh god, that sounds stupid, but I hope you got what I mean.\n\nSo is that possible? Can I just google the Harvard Computer Science degree transcript sample and design my schedule exactly like it?"

In my dream where I saw the man doing this to me and he was blonde, in his late 30s/early 40s, wore a red shirt and a black suit, he was sitting at a bar drinking, w people around, nothing out of the ordinary. When I saw him in my vision I felt like he was evil?? He then looked at me and smirked, although I wasn't even there?? My vision then ended and I still couldn't sleep so I went to my mom's bedroom so that I ask her to sleep w me but as I was getting there I was getting really dizzy and I could hear the washing machine and it was so loud it drove me crazy??

I'm going on two months pretty ill now. In the start of December I contacted my family who then tested positive for Covid and proceeded to get mildly/moderately ill with the classic symptoms like anosmia. I also got ill with a mild fever but without anosmia. My PCR test was negative, as was my live-in partner's who was also sick.\n\nEver since then I haven't gotten consistently better. The main symptom is what sounds like post-exertional malaise, where I feel well one day and mildly exert myself, and then spend the next few days in bed with flu-like malaise, fatigue, body aches, shortness of breath, palpitations, headache and very strong dizziness when I stand up. This is getting worse, at first I was able to walk up to 5k steps a day and be bedridden for two days, now 1,5k steps have caused a week in bed. This is very consistent.\n\nBlood tests, lung X-ray, ECG and heart ultrasound are normal. Blood pressure varies from 80/50 to 100/80. It's higher on the days I feel better. My GP suggested a neurologist but forgot to refer me, and my brother who is a doctor said it sounds like long-Covid. My antibody test came back negative, as did my partner's.\n\nI was also told to go to a psychiatrist which I'll do but I doubt it's psychosomatic. I have bipolar 2 which is well controlled with medication and I regularly see a therapist, who has said I definitely don't have depression anymore, and I have felt very stable and happy since September, when I started exercising and losing weight. I'm also not stressed now, besides some anxiety when I feel better and need to let the energy out.\n\nWhat I'd like advice on is whether I should push for more tests. I will visit a private doctor if needed.  For now I'm following the guidelines for post-viral fatigue which is just resting, but I'm wondering whether something dangerous needs to be ruled out.\n\nThank you for your time."

What I'm experiencing is DEFINITELY PEM with delayed reactions to physical activity.\n\nI'm less than two months in after being exposed to a positive person and getting ill without loss of smell. My partner was also ill and tested negative for PCR and antibodies, but had no lasting symptoms.\n\nI started off being weak, dizzy and faint after the illness but would manage to walk up to 4k steps and only get ill for 2-3 days. The past few weeks, however, I've been ill almost nonstop, SOB, headaches, dizziness and palpitations getting much worse and sometimes too weak to even use a phone in bed. I don't work but now I can't even cook or crochet most of the time.\n\nI guess what I'm most struggling with is what to do with the few good days when I'm crawling out of my skin to move. Wednesday I was pretty much hypomanic and took a 1k step walk outside because I just couldn't sit, next day back in bed with \"flu\" symptoms. I was doing cardio everyday before this hit so it's pretty infuriating. I know I need to rest as much as possible but when I feel better it seems almost physically impossible.\n\nBlood tests, chest X-ray, ECG and heart ultrasound all normal, family doctor suggested a psychiatrist -_- fine, I was going to see one for my chronic mental symptoms anyway... but I was thinking of going private for more testing and advice and I just don't know if it's worth it, or even what kind of doctor to pick. Neurologist, rheumatologist, something else?... I doubt they can help.\n\nThis sucks. My sympathies to the many others with this problem. Hope we can all get through this."

I know a month of symptoms is by definition not ME/CFS, but I'm very scared of overexerting myself and deteriorating like I've read so much about, so I'd like to be careful and educated just in case. Perhaps you can reassure me instead or point me to other resources.\n\nI'm a 31 year old woman. Basically, over a month ago I got a bad cold, became extremely weak and now feel like I'm not recovering and crashing worse after the slightest exercise. I've always been a very sickly person with low immunity but this is stronger than what I've had before, except when I had pneumonia. After walking to the nearby store, I have to spend the entire next day in bed and even sitting up is too tiring. It seems to get worse every time. I have difficulty breathing and my heart races even laying down. I have headaches and chills, and occasionally a sore throat. Orthostatic hypotension is worse than ever in my life, and my blood pressure is at 80/50. I don't have brain fog, but thinking and especially talking feels physically exhausting.\n\nI've extensively read up on the exclusion diagnosis and none of the other illnesses ring true. I have managed bipolar but am quite sure this is not psychosomatic depression or anxiety as I'm probably more mentally stable and calm than ever, living in very supportive circumstances, and I'm very skilled at detecting mental episodes by now. I also go to therapy.\n\nI've had blood tests, ECG, heart ultrasound and lung X-ray, everything came back normal. My doctor wants to send me to a neurologist next. Is there any advice on what a neurologist could help with?\n\nBasically, if it's okay, I'd like to hear about others' experiences in the very beginning of their illness, and if they have done something differently if they'd known. I REALLY don't want to make a mistake and end up with another chronic illness. Thank you so much for reading through to the end, and please be gentle with me :)"

Alcohol always made me feel better, more social, giddy, and even when it didn't, it numbed my bad emotions and gave me something else to think about. Obviously this is bad and I've put on a huge beer belly over the years as well. I also just like having things in my mouth (dur hur) so I'd be putting them away at outings like no one's business. Recently I'd started feeling very intense almost physical self-hatred in the morning after but I didn't stop, just cut down a little bit, but I was still having beer for \"fun\".\n\nAS SOON as I started going to the gym and doing cardio a couple weeks ago, my cravings completely stopped. That's great, I was less depressed and no need to numb my feelings! I had a party without drinking and felt no pull. But then it got weird. I had a beer on Friday afternoon because I was physically tired and it relaxes my muscles a bit, one beer seemed to be fine. Then I went out with my friend and felt like more beers would make things fun and social - I had two more, I liked the taste but drank them very slowly for some reason (I usually gulp everything I drink, beer, water, tea, everything). I didn't feel tipsy. I didn't feel any of the \"comeup\" that at least starts to happen with three beers. Instead I was just getting tired and mentally slow, and then intense paranoia crept up on me that I was saying the wrong things, that the atmosphere was bad, that I'm an abnormal person - all things that alcohol used to eradicate only a month ago. I think my thinking was clear and I did CBT techniques to resolve my thoughts but I just got these intense physical symptoms of anxiety that persisted into the next day and Sunday.\n\nI'm calorie counting now so that stopped me from trying to guzzle down more beer in a desperate attempt to feel better, as I usually do. I didn't even WANT to do it but I often try things just to see how they'll make me feel, not this time.\n\nOf course I kept trying, I had a small can of wine on Monday, made me tired and sad. I had about two-three shots of alcohol yesterday, tired and sad.\n\nThe ONLY thing I changed before this happened was starting the gym and becoming much less depressed. I started eating low-carb and counting calories only very recently.\n\nOf course this is a great thing to happen to me, but does this happen to anyone else? How tf do you explain this :D"

Are you concerned just because you think watching porn is a morally bad thing to do or because you noticed some behaviors that could be symptoms of porn addiction? \n\nOne thing I noticed for example is that when I was a kid I liked reading very much. Then around middle school, which was the time when I started watching porn, I stopped doing it because I found it increasingly more boring. Since I stopped with porn, I've rediscovered my love for reading. Of course, this is just something I noticed in myself, but what I'm trying to convey is that watching porn is a highly stimulating activity. If you consume a lot of it, you might start getting bored more easily because you are used to highly stimulating stuff, such as porn. \n\nAnother thing I noticed is that if haven't watched porn in months, I am super mindful with regard to sex. When I have sex I'm completely absorbed by it and I can't think of anything else. On the contrary, some months ago I relapsed pretty hard and begun watching porn again for some time. When I had sex then (and to a degree I still do even though I've been almost one-month porn free now) I often thought about other stuff, sometimes not even sexual, and I couldn't really reach climax without thinking of some pornstar.\n\nMaybe try and ask him if he experiences anything like this, or other stuff you find on this sub that is correlated to heavy porn usage. If he never considered porn as a problem, chances are he thinks these things are just normal and you can't do anything to prevent them. If you explain to him that they are not and they can be caused by porn, he may start reconsidering porn usage. You could also ask him if he just wants to try and not watch porn for something like a month and then decide if he's better off with or without it. If he can't stay without porn for this much time this could be a big indicator of a porn addiction.\n\nIn conclusion, make sure he realizes the consequences porn has on his life because as long as he doesn't he will keep thinking there is nothing wrong with it and that there is no reason to stop.\n\nAlso, understand that if he really struggles with porn addiction it is not because of you. If he didn't love you or he felt dissatisfied with your relationship he would have manifested it in other ways. Possibly he would have already left you. Instead, he chose to be with you despite watching porn, and he still does. You say you are in a very happy relationship: I can tell you that if him watching porn had anything to do with you not being enough for him, you would have a whole set of problems bigger than this one.\n\nI wish you and your boyfriend good luck on your journey.",

I hope this doesn't break any rules.\n\nThe more I study, read, delve into this and other subreddits, read the news, the more I feel like socialism is as desirable as unattainable. I see the injustices of the world and I believe I understand their root cause, but at the same time, it appears as if the majority of the people either don't know or don't care and they don't seem eager to change their minds. And this is the part that really gets me: we are too few, and the more I try to talk to people, the more I see a deep-rooted reluctance at accepting the socialist thesis that has way more to do with one's own prejudice towards the movement, than with actual logic.\n\nMy motto is \"Pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will.\" A Gramsci quote that has accompanied me since I first heard it a couple of years ago, and that has been my guiding light through the development of my political conscience: from liberal, to social democrat, to liberal socialist, to democratic socialist. I always interpreted it as the acknowledgment of the fact that significant change is hard to obtain, so hard that it may seem impossible at times. Nonetheless, it is only if we work hard that it may be possible to get the kind of society that we need, and, I believe, we deserve.\n\nIn the last couple of months though, I started questioning whether this is of any use or not. I believe western society as we know it will die during the course of this century. But I also feel like a fascist uprising is way more probable than a socialist one. And if it won't be fascism, it will be techno-feudalism. I don't even know which one would be worse, or if there is that much of a difference after all. But everywhere I see nothing but a sentiment that ranges from active anti-communism at worst, to plain resignation at best.\n\nHow do you deal with this? I don't want to just give up on the fight. But I also want to be happy, to not feel as if the world were just going to get worse and worse during the course of my lifetime."

Yesterday we played the campaign in which my friend is the DM and here's what happened.\n\nIn the previous sessions we were captured by some strange cultist elves. We were brought in a prison underground and we were forced to mine with other prisonsers to find pieces of a special mineral. In the last session we started to try and figure out a way to escape and yesterday had to be the session in which we tried to put our plan into action.\n\nBefore the session started the DM said something like: pay attention because this is going to be hard, it is not unlikely that some of you will die. At first I was like \"ok thank you, now we know that we have to be concentrated because we only have one shot\".\n\nEvery morning to guards came to wake us up and send us to work. Only one of them had the keys and every day the guards changed. Our plan was to use the spell suggestion to trick one of the guards into picking up a fight with the other guard, at the same moment we would use the caos caused by the fight to take the keys and start opening other cells, starting a rebellion and exploiting the other prisoners to fight the guards. It seemed like a good plan until the guard who was supposed to be the one who started the fight literally oneshotted the other guard with a fist. Then other guards came and it seemed like our plan was going to fail and we were going to die. But then one npc that was our friend and that was imprisoned with us started killing guards as if he was some god or something like that and we managed to escape.\n\nNow I'm gonna be honest, I didn't have fun at all. It's true that he said that it was going to be hard, but we had no choice. I believe you should put your players in a highly dangerous position only if it's the result of something wrong they did, but we didn't. We just were in the wrong place at the wrong time and were captured. Then in the prison we talked for at least two hours to figure out a plan and we were going to die nonetheless, I felt completely useless. Nothing I could do could prevent our inevitable death and other players couldn't do anything too. The DM understood that and he helped us with the npc making us survive but again, it wasn't our merit. One second we were going to die and we could do nothing to prevent it, the next one we were going to escape but not because of what we did.\n\nThis is to say, dms, please, remember that you are not writing a book, you're trying to make people have fun. And making them feel useless it's not something fun for them, even though it makes up for a great story. Remember that they are the heroes and major events that happen to them should be at least in part a consequence of their choices.\n\nIt's the player's story at least as much as it is yours."

Another thing I recently did was starting a complete rewatch of Rick and Morty. While I was watching Episode 2 of Season 1, Lawnmower Dog, I couldn't help but notice some similarities to Animal Farm. I'm not saying that whatever the dogs did is a communist revolution of course, but bear with me.\n\nIf you haven't read the book go and read it, it's good. If you're lazy and you don't want to, here's the plot: in a farm, a boar realizes that if there were a rebellion and all the animals fought the farmer, Mr. Jones, they would live better, since they would consume all that they produce, without needing to give anything to humans. So there is a successful rebellion and they establish a new system based on a theory called Animalism, which basically says that all animals are equal and no animal should do anything that could resemble what a human could do. There are two pigs in particular who always argue on what to do with the farm, until one of them, Napoleon, calls some dogs and makes them go after the other pig, Snowball, who is forced to escape from Animal Farm. The rest of the book is just Napoleon, who is the new supreme leader, and the other pigs who gradually become more and more similar to humans to the point of basically be indistinguishable from them.\n\nIf all of this sounds familiar, well, you remember something from your history classes after all, because it's basically the history of the Soviet Revolution and the rise of Stalin.\n\nIn Lawnmower Dog there is a dog, Snuffles, who realizes that dogs are treated unjustly by humans. He then decides to gather all his dog friends (or comrades if you will), to overthrow the power of the humans and found a new society in which dogs could live happily. This seems pretty much a revolution to me, and although it's not a communist one, it's nonetheless a rebellion made by animals.\n\nSo far so good, until Snuffles decides to be called Snowball and I start wondering: what if this episode is, at some level, the expression of the opinion of the writer, Ryan Ridley, about the Soviet Revolution?\n\nIn Animal Farm, Snowball is the alter ego of Lev Trockij, while Napoleon is the one of Joseph Stalin. In Animal Farm, Napoleon ends up not being any different, if not even worse,  than a human, in the same way as Stalin ends up being no different from a Capitalist, if not even worse than one of them. But in Lawnmower Dog, Snowball is the leader, and he doesn't end up like a human. In fact, the whole plan of Rick consists of the fact that he knows that, no matter what, Snowball won't become a human. What if this is a way in which Ryan Ridley is trying to tell us that if Trockij ended up being the one in charge instead of Stalin, the USSR wouldn't have become the totalitarian monster that it became? What if Ryan Ridley is trying to tell us that if Trockij had become the leader of the USSR, we would now live in not just a different, but a better world?\n\nOn top of that, in the end of the episode, Snowball decides to go to another dimension, a dimension in which he will build a different and better society and that Rick, as he ends up saying, would really like to see (implying that if there were a tv series about it, he would like to see it). Is it possible that this symbolizes the fact that Ryan Ridley would like to live in a different dimension, in which Trockij became the communist leader and in which everyone could live a better life than the one we are living in this dimension?\n\nWhat do you think, is it possible that Ryan Ridley (and possibly the other writers) sympathizes with at least a part of what Trockij said and subtly manifested his opinion through Lawnmower Dog?\n\nP.S.= Sorry for the grammar and orthographic errors, English is not my native language."

I'm not sure about what I want to do yet, but I know one thing: I don't want to choose what's easy. And by easy I don't mean a faculty in which I don't have to study, I believe that there's no such thing as that. I mean that I want to study something I'm passionate about, even if it means ending up doing some not that well payed job. My parents told me to pay attention and to consider wisely a lot of alternatives that could be overall good, even if they're not exactly what I'd love to do (I would really love to study philosphy, history, physics, psychology, political sciences, sciology, pedagogy, all fields that are not that... valorized by society).Of course I know they love me and I know they're doing this because they don't want me to have financial problems, and I don't want either. The point is that it's not my priority, I don't want to end up doing something that is not what I dreamed of just because I wasn't brave enough to try. But I don't want to settle for something that's less of what I know I can do. I'm dealing with a lot of self-doubt lately, but I don't want to lose hope. Some yesfam positivity would be appreciated. Love you all, peace."

You have to divide those 75 points in order to generate the 6 ability scores. You can't generate scores higher than 16 nor lower than 8 and at least one of the 6 ability scores must be an 8.\n\nThen you add your race ability score bonuses, but you can decide to move one of those three bonus points wherever you want, except in an ability score which is already been increased by two via these bonuses. (You can't have a +3 in just one ability score as a racial bonus).\n\nI know that something similar already exists in the Basic Rules, but I wanted to give it a twist so my players can be more creative with what they want to do with their character and at the same time the party is a little stronger and more balanced as far as ability scores are concerned.\n\nThank you in advance for your feedback :)"

Ofcourse, out of boredom, and likely still sedated, he goes to play (pawing at) with the water, a behavior we've never noticed before. He does not try to drink from his wet paws like other cats I've had. Our boy immediately B lines to the litter box and rolls around in it, seems on par for the course. Once he gets up he shakes his feet everywhere and goes back to paw at water.\n\nWe rinsed our the water as many times as we could, I kept thinking he would settle down eventually. I also tried adding more to the bowl just in case it was a wisker issue, though he never had a problem with this drinking bowl before. \n\nThe least of my concern is this morning is now the walls and floor is covered with wet clumps of clay, and the floors very damp, as well as the shower rug. My biggest concern is that now he has big clumps of clay on his feet and a caked on clay nose. Pondering it trying to fall back asleep I realised that he might be injesting some unintentionally. \n\nMy partner had left for work, and im also recovering from an invasive surgery so i can't function as I normally do physically or mentally as I didn't get much sleep. My plan is to attempt to wash with up with a damp towel on all his toes, and have my partner get standard house hold litter that clumps less for his duration of recovery (I cant drive in my condition).\n\n Is there anything else I can do to help him and keep him safe before my partner can get home? Any Cat Advice that can be offered would be greatly bennificial."

Like his actor is amazing, he potrayed him really well, but every time he is on screen I kinda wanted to punch something. Also all in all I think he is more of an evil person than Stahl. Stahl did horrible things, but Toric did horrible things that got him retired! For example being a racist along with many other things. Both are evil but Toric def makes place 1 in my most hated SoA characters.\nWho is your most hated character? Is it Stahl, Pope, Toric or someone else?"

Like Tig is my fav character, so I am always in when it\u2019s about having more Tig screen time, but I just feel like this storyline with Tigs dog and with Kozik could have been much more.

You can tell me im coping or whatever but hear me out, the card art, showing him from the back with the attack far away, looks like an AOE card art. The animation itself looks like it was AOE and they made it slightly smaller when they changed it. They saw all the videos and speculations and thought double AOE would be too strong so they nerfed him. Then they knew he was bad so they put some of the best units on his banner to bait people to summon. Demons just cant have good supports, you know something is wrong when demon hendrikson is the best option they have.\n\nAnd can we just talk about how ultra mediocre he is? What does he do for the demon team? He seems like a back unit but he is not even an improvement over green zeldris. His damage is also kinda low and he has a hard time criting. This man feels so incomplete, he just released on jp and it already feels like he needs a holy relic. I was watching nagato's video on him and the mf with a 6/6 weak point ultimate kills NO ONE on the enemy team. And to top it all off, because netmarble are some assholes, they make his passive pvp only... why?\n\nThis man was supposed to be the peak version of zeldris and he ends up as this sad, sad unit. Let me know of your thoughts on him."

Hes a worse version of harald: same provisions, same power, worse passive (and a lot less good cards to trigger the passive) and you cant evem choose what bronze unit to play. The rng is awful here, why does auberon have to be the only evolving card whose ability is tied with rng? Just make it \"create and play a wild hunt bronze unit from starting deck\" when you have devotion. And i would make him 6 power again too (keeping 12 provisions), as it stands he barely breaks even most of the time.\nMeanwhile, viraxas, who got a huge buff due to the new shield ability and the shielded duel units he can \"reset\", for some reason is the only evolving card that remains at 11 provisions.\nI would also make a case for caranthir as well, as his nerf had no good reason behind it, but you cant use him on anything decent besides probably beast, so i dont really care. While we're at it, please give eredin a small buff. He barely sees play and i doubt you can play him with white frost because outside of carapace he gets removed every single time.\n\nTl;Dr: Auberon is very weak rn, i suggest buffing him by 1 point and removing his rng, or at least one of the two."

When people ask if I\u2019m a man or a woman I really don\u2019t know what to tell them (although it is eventually revealed in my voice since I have a high pitched girly voice which I hate) what does this mean?

I have to maintain a certain GPA to maintain my scholarship, and I don't think that's possible given that I'm on the cusp of a D in CS. I've calculated many GPA scenarios, and about half won't let me keep it. Additionally, I'm at 12 credit hours right now, so dropping CS won't make me a full-time student. However, because I've already been billed for 12 hours, a withdrawal won't affect my scholarship eligibility or other finances (I checked with the Office of Special Scholarships to confirm yesterday).\n\nThe problem is that there's a chance I could pull through and maintain a C in CS. If the Chemistry grade can be curved at the end (or I do extraordinarily well on the final), I can maintain a sufficient GPA and continue my current academic track. What do you think I should do?"

What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.:\n\n21, male, not really outgoing but i enjoy parties time yo time pretty quiet most of the time and i got some really weird reasoning on why i do things\n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow? \n\nI mean im kinda depressed but not in any way that id think changes my outview on life\n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nNo religious upbringing, but a reacurring theme in my childhood was politics, my dad was a politician and activist most of his life, my mom was a politician. My dad always valued debating and teaching me and my brother about political theory and getting us involved in more intellectual stuff\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI work admin at a logistics warehouse, i dont like my job, but i love my coworkers, everybody is so supportive and open to teach you on your mistakes.. but the whole office stuff is the worst, the most fun i have is when i go help the forklift operators move stuff and tire myself lol\n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nFine, i spend most weekends by myself , i like to go out and meet friends and family, but when im all by myself everything just feel like its flowing at my own pace.\n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nNever been good at sports, but i like to bike and used to skate when i was younger.. enjoyed doing some jiu jitsu for a couple months but got discouraged after some time.. also im not able to follow a schedule lol.\n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nPretty curious but in a very secretive way, I have a hard time asking questions and understanding  the answers, so I'll usually figure stuff out by myself or just look at how ppl do something  but of course there are times I'll ask questions and get a good understanding\n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nI definitely hate leadership positions, I feel like I got  too much expectations on me and can't make mistakes because people count on me, also I'll feel tied to something\n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nNot very coordinated tbh, I mean could have something to do with a condition that affects my finer motor skills like my handwriting fucking sucks.. but like it's not uncommon to me trying to grab something and hitting something that's in between  me and the object I grabbed\n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nKinda? I mean I'm not really good at creating something from scratch,  but I've always enjoyed putting my own spin on my stuff like painting my shoes, painting my skateboard dying my hair making accessories  out of old things I'd find.\n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nIdk? it's not something I'm able to explain? if I had a specific situation then it would depend.\n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nI will usually help, but it all depends on whose asking. I don't know the reason  I just  think why not \n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nYeah but in my own way, just  because someone thinks and presents something as logically  consistent it doesn't mean it'll change my mind\n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nNot much, I mean I'll try to avoid making things harder than they are but my priority is doing the thing.\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nNo, I hate that for the same reason I hate leadership positions  I don't think people should  be told how to live their lives \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nRight now I'm working with air dry clay, I like doing it, I'm able to make cute things for my friends and really distract myself from  my job\n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI'll skip and avoid most things taught in college, I'll lie to myself saying it's easy or I'll just read a book about it later and I never do that.. I have an easier time learning something when i do it.\n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI'll usually improvise I'm TERRIBLE at organising tasks and doing them In a linear way \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nFeeling happy, having enough free time to do what I like and finding myself and what I enjoy doing\n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI hate  feeling like I'm wasting  my life because I'm trying to fit into someone's else's standards of what it is to be successful or happy\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nI'll usually  be w a loved one and enjoying unique moments like stuff that won't happen again that somehow the universe made it all happen at the same time\n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nI spend way too much time alone, don't feel any  connection to anyone, always thinking and worrying about what I'm doing w my life\n\n\u2022\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI daydream a lot, I'm usually thinking about why I'm living this way and why I'm feeling  a certain way  of course sometimes I completely escape reality and just think about  what I could be doing. \nI'm usually aware of my surroundings  even daydreaming I've never needed someone to snap  me out of a daydream or like  catch my attention\n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nHow did I got here? \n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nIt depends, but it'll usually take some time I'll usually  start something before I'm sure of what I'm feeling and sometimes I'll start something before being sure just to have a taste of what it is like \n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nSome time.. emotions  are very important to me I always like to let my heart feel whatever it is feeling, even if it's the most trivial thing, its just better to see who I really am\n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nNo, not really.. I mean  if its something that matters to that person I won't disagree w then but if it's just someone saying stuff I don't agree with I'll either remove myself from the conversation or stare my opinion\n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why\n\nSometimes yeah, I think rich old white dudes wrote most laws and that's shouldn't be our moral compass. \nI mean in a new place I'll usually follow the rules but the longer  I'm there, the more often I'll disagree  with them"

I laugh a lot with my friends. Do harmless stupid shit at times (drinking ice-cream with a straw, spreading false rumour that it\u2019s someone\u2019s birthday etc etc) without caring much about it.         \n         \nI also go to raves, dance with friends, laugh hysterically etc. And these were the things that I wouldn\u2019t do before and Idk how much of it impacts personality type",

                "body": "  \n\nHello MBTI Community,\n\nI hope you guys are good. I am unable to type myself using your conventional tests, and I am not able to reliably grasp function theory. But some of you might be able to help me out here. For context, I have been consistently INFJ for couple of years, and I was happy with that. But two or so years later I am getting typed as ENFJ, INFP and INFJ. I need your help to figure this out. Few things about me that I will throw as bullet points:\n\n\\- I am passionate about life. I listen and nerd music, cars and academics (sociology and law). I am curious about life and how things connect (emotional and concrete variables). I am mentally organized and like to build and dismantle frameworks. Which means I think a lot.\n\n\\- But my mind is very abstract. I don\u2019t always have words to explain myself or how I understand things. Analogies and artistic expressions are the mediums where I shine.\n\n\\- I get socially discharged around most people, except my partner (ENFJ). Which is why I tend to be careful as to who I spend how much time with. \n\n\\- I like to get into philosophical discussions and tend to think about why I am the way I am. \n\n\\- To answer what I am? I think I am predisposed to be melancholic and sad. The conflict within comes from being not-understood well, and being unable to come to terms with clashing values of society, my parents, people and myself. I am changing that. \n\n\\- I am idealistic but can turn my idealism in reality because I am driven with what I believe in.\n\n\\- I am extremely private person and I tend to keep to myself about how I feel. But I can project my values on people and bring about change. \n\n\\- A lot of people feel extremely close to me and feel understood by me, but I don\u2019t feel the same towards any of them (one or two exceptions). This sometimes drains me.\n\n\\- I can become friends with virtually anyone and can have impact on their personality. Partly because I have a deep sense of empathy for anyone, and I make sure people feel understood and cared for in my company. I am also patient. Combine all three (empathy, understanding, patience) and I am perfectly capable of guiding someone in a positive direction.\n\n\\- My friends and even acquaintances find me a positive person who makes their day by tiny things like even how I would greet them. Partly because, I remember people, their quirks and how they react in social situations. \n\n\\- I have an extremely strong intuition that works like an almanac of sort. I unconsciously gather pieces of information about someone, and when time comes my mind spits the right thing to do or say. \n\n\\- When I meet someone, my mind is naturally predisposed to be hyper-focused to figure out a person. I notice changes in their body language as they tell me about themselves and figure out how a thing makes them feel. To dig deeper, I find myself giving off information about myself in a calculated manner (so I don\u2019t expose myself), but such that it comes off casual. \n\n\\- While I am perceived as very positive by others, I think I am a sad person for the most part (partly due to trauma emotional abuse as child, and sexual abuse). \n\n\\- I like to walk alone, eat alone and watch stuff alone. I like nights and winters. \n\n\\- I am also very organized and a natural leader."

Their character designs are different, as the New Queen Bee has her hair down instead of in a ponytail, a black blazer, and yellow pants. She has a similar color scheme to Chloe, but a completely different style. Besides, ladybug would not give Chloe a miraculous again. The new Queen Bee has the exact same face design as Chloe, kind of like how Felix has the same face design as Adrien. A strong explanation as to why the new QB looks like Chloe (even though she\u2019s not) is because she\u2019s Chloe\u2019s secret sister.\n\nThoughts? Currently trying to avoid studying for my finals lol"

But even if it\u2019s wrong it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not reality. Realistically a feminine woman will want a more masculine man if the relationship will go the distance.

                "body": "Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh sisters and brothers,\n\nSubhanAllahi wa bihamdihi SubhanAllahil azeem. Ya Allah, please send infinite blessings and salutations upon the Prophet Muhammad (saw) and his loved ones such as his family and companions and may He do the same for every Prophet (peace be upon them all) and their loved ones. In the name of Allah, the most Compassionate, most Merciful.\n\nI can't tell you how many nights I've lost sleep, spent crying, been scared and in fear of: \"What if X or Y doesn't happen?\" or \"What if A or B happens?\" even with thinking this I knew, Allah's will is the best thing that could happen, but at the same time if I something didn't go my way, I feared that to such a high extent. I know it's really contradictory, and looking back I think: \"Was I for real?\" but truthfully I don't even have to think that because I know I was for real.\n\nBut I think of that girl I was back then, and compare it to who I am now, and in such a short space of time- I can't tell you how much has changed in my life.\n\nAnd throughout all this time from the nights I spent crying until my head hurt and I fell asleep, to now, and everything I've been through in-between all the changes in life, even when I've slipped up and screwed up- Allah SWT has always had my back. Through it all, there's been times when He's given me exactly what I wanted, times when He didn't give me what I wanted but gave me what I needed and through that I've learned from when I've screwed up, and times when He didn't give me what I wanted but replaced it with something even better so much better that I don't want what I previously wanted anymore. \n\nThe thing is, you can know something without understanding it. Back then I knew Allah's will was always best, even if it isn't what I initially wanted. But I clearly didn't understand it because if I truly understood it I wouldn't have spent all those nights and days worrying and crying. SubhanAllah. \n\nNow, I'm in a place in my life where I truly understand what Allah wills is best for us, even if it isn't what we initially want. And that doesn't mean, I want certain things any less- but what it does mean is that I'm not going to cry myself to sleep over the fear of it not happening, I'm not going to lay awake in the dead of the night fearing if it doesn't happen- and what's going to happen if certain things I want to happen, don't happen? I may cry for a short while, emotionally express myself and whatever way I see fit but once I let out my emotions, I'm going to wipe away the tears or pick up the pieces of my broken heart or both, and say \"Alhamdulillah\" because Allah's will is the best thing that can happen, and His plans over mine any day of the week, and I'm going to know that what I wanted didn't happen for a reason and perhaps it's His protection, or Him teaching me a lesson that I need to learn for my own good, or Him with something even better for me, or maybe it's all of the above. \n\nBut the point is, it isn't going to be how I thought it may be. And I once thought that if Allah didn't give me what I wanted then I'd lead the rest of my life depressed and sad and heartbroken. But then other things happen, thanks to Allah, things you don't count for and suddenly what you once wanted becomes a distant memory and you're thanking Allah for what He gave you. And the truth is, He knew it was better for you, way before you did. \n\nSo I don't know who needs to hear this but if things aren't going your way, perhaps Allah isn't punishing you. If you're becoming closer to Allah as a result of this, it certainly is not a punishment, Alhamdulillah- it's a blessing. Maybe it's good for you, you don't get what you want. Maybe you need to learn a few lessons before He gives it to you. Maybe He's not giving it to you because there's danger ahead you can't see. Maybe He's got something greater in store for you. Maybe He's just making you wait in order to help you grow so you as a person become stronger before He gives it to you. You may or may not get what you want. I may or may not get what I want.\n\nAnd the \"may not\" part used to scare me so much, I never even wanted to contemplate that. But it doesn't scare me anymore, and it shouldn't scare you either because \"may not\" is for a reason, and as time goes on, you will discover that reason and looking back at everything you will see how Allah had your back the whole time and you will say \"Alhamdulillah\" and think \"What did I do to deserve such a Loving, Kind, Compassionate and most of all Merciful Allah?\" I know because that's what I thought.\n\nAnd that's true maturity. If you remember Allah, He will remember you. And He will not let you down no matter what happens, whether you get what you want, or not. Know this, understand this, and you will thrive. You'll break free from the chains of your fear, and that is one of the most liberating feelings ever. As I always like to say, if anything liberates me, it's Islam, Alhamdulillah.\n\nAssalamualaikum :)"

                "body": "Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh sisters and brothers,\n\nFirst of all I intend to write this post for the sake of Allah as something of a reflection on myself, and (I'm hoping) to be words of inspiration and motivation to others. So other Muslims who discovered Islam in 1442 can not only relate but feel like they weren't alone in doing so, because sometimes it can definitely feel that way. And because writing helps me strengthen my iman, because this ability is a gift Allah gave me Subhanallah, so I intend to use it for good.\n\nAll Glory is to Allah, all Praise is to Him. Glorified is Allah, the Great. Ya Allah please send infinite blessings and salutations upon the Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa and his loved ones such as his family and companions. In the name of Allah, the most Compassionate, most Merciful.\n\n1442 is especially special year to me, brothers and sisters. I was born into a Muslim family yet for so long I was only Muslim in name, but not by practice. In all honesty, for so long my only reason for being Muslim was that I was born into a Muslim family, even if I didn't know in those times. I didn't really know Allah SWT or the Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa I just blindly believed in them.\n\nBut in 1442 all that changed. \n\nBefore I was a Muslim who tried to justify my sins partially due to my own desires and partially due to misunderstanding the religion. And I say partially because my desires are what led me to misunderstand Islam, like I'd look for any Muslim who seemed like they knew what they were talking about to tell me my sins aren't sins if we interpret the Quran dIfFeReNtLy.\n\nAlhamdulillah, Allah guided me in 1442 and let me truly understand what it means to be a Muslim. That we truly submit to Allah. And submitting to Allah, does not mean you have to practice Islam perfectly (that's basically impossible because we all have our shortcomings) but practice it to the best of your ability, and if you are committing a certain sin whatever it may be, rather than trying to rEiNtErPrEt the Quran to justify your sinning for the sake of you not feeling bad, feel bad about your sin because it's a sin. Feeling bad about a sin is a sign of iman. Accept that yes you are sinning and say to Allah: \"Ya Rabb, this is one of my shortcomings, astaghfirullah help me become better.\" And explain to Him everything, why you do it, why it's difficult for you to quit, ask Him to give you help and strength and to make you better and repent for your sin(s). That is submission to Allah and a great sign of iman. Not to mention, admitting you are wrong, especially when you enjoy the sin a lot is a sign of strength and humility and solely by admitting you're wrong and sinful in doing whatever sin you are doing, means you've put one foot on the right path.\n\nIn 1442, I came to terms with that if we really look at what true Islam is, Islam from the Quran and Sunnah- that actually I was more sinful than I thought. And that was a tough pill for me to sallow. But none the less, I did and here I am today- I overcame so many of my sins all by the Mercy and help of Allah.\n\nI learn who Allah SWT really is too. Before, I only ever really understood the punishing side of Allah, Allah's punishment and that Allah is the The Punisher, was only emphasized to me, despite the fact that He has 98 other qualities. That He is so much more than The Punisher alone, He's the Most Merciful, Most Compassionate, The Forgiver, The Embodiment Of Peace, The Origin Of Love, and so much more Subhanallah. Before, I used to spend nights in my bed crying and crying and crying questioning if Allah would ever forgive me and begging him for forgiveness thinking that He was too angry at me to forgive me Astaghfirullah. In 1442, I learned that it's an insult to Allah to actually think He won't forgive you if you repent sincerely and have the intention to stop sinning, and that His Mercy is far greater than His Anger and that Allah loves me more than my own mother. If I made a mistake, yes my mother would be mad at me, but she wouldn't hate me forever and want to punish me for the rest of my life- so how could Allah SWT who loves us all more than our mothers?\n\nBefore I used to 'realistic' in most of my duas and doubtful of them. Like: \"Oh Allah make X happen but if X doesn't happen, make Y happen, and if Y doesn't happen...\" Now I understand that Allah is so Generous He gives us times when he accepts dua Subhanallah. The Last Third of The Night, between Asr and Magrib on Friday, the 9th of Dhul al-Hijjah, when it rains, and that's just a few examples. And I understand Allah's capability of making our duas come true, I've seen it with my very own eyes. So now? I ask for things that if I told most people they'd be like: \"You're crazy that's never going to happen\" but they don't know my Lord, Allah. Subhanallah may He enter their hearts one day. Ameen.\n\nI see 1442 as the year I discovered Islam even though I am born into a Muslim family because up until 1442 being Muslim was just another part of my identity, like being British or Pakistani astaghfirullah. But now? Being Muslim is a way of life for me, Islam is such a huge part of my life now, and has changed me for the better that I can't ever imagine going back to who I used to be. A young girl who was so consumed in the dunya around her, my heart was so heedless astaghfirullah. \n\nI truly believe that I am so lucky to be born into a Muslim family because the truth was made much easier for me to find. The truth was right in front of me, yet I walked down so many other paths looking for fulfillment, a way to achieve justice, a way to feel empowered and solve everything wrong with the world, and all along that path was right in front of me yet I was so blind. It's like the light was shining on the straight path, yet all the other paths looked so interesting. I wanted to see what was in the darkness, I wanted to see where all bends and zig zags led to, and it turns out- it was a dead end. Every path I tried to walk down disappointed me, I got hope in thinking I finally found 'the one' yet I was crushed every time I became disappointed and realized how false they were. Then in 1442, I noticed that one straight path I'd been ignoring, and I saw how the light shone upon it, how simply straight it was. And because it seemed so simple and straightforward (lol  pun intended) it looked boring to me all those other times, but in 1442 I decided to just to put one foot on that path, then I decided to put both feet on that path and stand there. It felt amazing. It felt even better when I decided to walk on that path, and when I ran Subhanallah it felt indescribably good until I realized that not everything has to be rushed and that I'm tiring myself out and that iman is fluctating some days you'll be walking on that path, other days you'll be running, other days you'll be crawling, and other days you'll be taking baby steps that seem nonexistent, and somedays you might just stand still. But so long as you are on that path, it's the best thing for you. And on that path you discover parts of yourself you never knew, Allah, the Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa and all the other Prophets, you do things you never even thought you were capable of doing it's just a beautiful journey which on the surface looks boring but once you experience it- it's everything you ever wanted and more. And where does this path lead to? Jannah InshAllah.\n\n1442 was a year that changed me for the better and I have all kinds of feelings for 1443, but more than anything I am grateful. Because to even be on this path is a huge privilege, and I feel so blessed that Allah pulled me out of the darkness and I wouldn't change this for anything.\n\nAssalamualaikum :)"

Ya Allah send infinite blessings and salutations upon the Prophet Muhammad (saw) and his loved ones. In the name of Allah, the most Compassionate, most Merciful.\n\n**My stance on music:**\n\nI am unsure about the permissibility of music. I know that music promoting sinful behaviour is haram, but music as as a whole (as in instruments)? I'm unsure. And [in this hadith](https://www.abuaminaelias.com/dailyhadithonline/2011/02/14/halal-haram-clear/) the Prophet Muhammad (saw) tells us to abstain from doubtful matters, so believe it is best to not listen to music because I am doubtful about the permissibility of music as a whole.\n\n**Why I'm writing this post:**\n\nI want to help brothers and sisters out there quit music, and listen to more halal and beneficial things.\n\n**Where the post itself starts:**\n\nOkay so I'm going to be sharing some halal alternatives I listen to instead of music. Music is incredibly addictive and you know sometimes you get the urge to listen to it \"just once more\" and sometimes people fall weak to that urge may Allah forgive us, but as Muslims what we should try to do is overcome that urge and desire, and turn to our halal alternatives.\n\nInstead of of music I like to listen to:\n\n1. **Quran** \\- Obviously at the top of the list, Alhamdulillah because what better to listen to than the words of our Creator? Listening to Quran, elevates your iman, makes you feel at peace, it's just so beautiful to hear Mashallah. Truly the most beautiful words I ever heard. My favourite reciter and is Mishray Rashid Alafasy, may Allah bless him, continue to guide him, accept every spoken and unspoken dua from his heart, and may Allah grant him the best of this world and Jannah, Ameen. Here is the channel where I listen to Quran recitations from: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmr7s-S9m-0BKrOr7red8rA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmr7s-S9m-0BKrOr7red8rA)\n2. **Nasheeds** \\- Nasheeds are amazing Subhanallah and a great way to get off mainstream music and songs. Because they basically are songs with vocals only and they remind us of Allah. My Nasheed playlist isn't that full yet, I only have two Nasheeds in there so far, but Inshallah with time I will get more in there, and one day it will be full of beautiful Nasheeds that remind me of Allah. I think in the future I'll probably make different Nasheed playlists based on my mood, lol. But until then, to also get you started, here are the two Nasheeds in my playlist: [\\#Salaam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS6Eagk2YTM), [WHERE IS THE LOVE?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpRdwFmAjYY)\n3. **Speakers Corner Discussions** \\- Honestly I cannot tell you how much I enjoy these. For those of you who don't know Speakers Corner, is a place in London also known as Hyde Park, and usually some beautiful discussions between Muslim brothers and non-Muslims. You can usually find the longer discussions on the [SALAM YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SALAMInitiative/videos) and they're good to watch to see an outsiders perspective, and the answers Muslims have to such questions- and also it may help us in learning how to address certain topics about Islam with non-Muslims Alhamdulillah. Very beneficial channel, and very great work, Alhamdulillah.\n4. **Podcasts** \\- Podcasts are just great to listen to, if you want to learn something- it can be Islamic or it could just be something not necessarily Islamic but it helps you as a Muslim. [The Three Muslims](https://www.youtube.com/c/The3Muslims/videos) and [the MH Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzESAoLKD0l8e9M6mk2TuC5vEh8wYlP_6) are both podcasts I recommend, Alhamdulillah.\n5. **Debates** \\-  Debates are always good because you get to hear two sides of a topic, in a controlled civil environment, both get time to present their case, and you can conclude through your own judgement who has the stronger argument and who is correct. Mohammed Hijab is somebody who has partook in lots of debates, [here is his playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzESAoLKD0l9gv_XCtZsay7cUHjdT_whn) and here is a debate not directly Islamic, but it is about something that affects the situation in Palestine, and is very informative so I highly recommend everybody listens to the [Anti-Zionism Is Antisemitism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1VTt_THL4A&t=1165s) debate\n6. **Dawah Channels** \\- So this is basically self-explanatory, YouTube Channels that give dawah. I'm going to make a whole separate post dedicated to this, because there's just so many channels I want to share with you guys that deserves another post entirely, but for now check out these three: [Ali Dawah](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDawowProject), [Smile2Jannah](https://www.youtube.com/user/smiletojannah),[Saajid Lipham](https://www.youtube.com/user/saajidlipham).\n7. **Make Your Own Playlists** \\- So if you have a bunch of Nasheeds you like, create a nasheed playlist. If you have a bunch of debates, podcasts, or dawah videos you've been meaning to watch but never quite get round to it, make a playlist dedicated one to the debates, one to the podcasts, one to the dawah videos. Make a Quran recitation playlist and if you like to switch between reciters then make one dedicated to each reciter. If you have a bunch of interesting content like about the toxicity of the beauty industry, the problems with modern political ideologies such as feminism, red pill, or something else- create a playlist dedicated to that content. Again I'm going to make a separate post about playlists themselves because I think it's a really important point to raise when quitting music, and therefore deserves it's own post Alhamdulillah.\n\nTo conclude, I hope you brothers and sisters and even non-Muslims if you're reading this post- I hope everyone reading this post benefitted from it. Brothers and sisters I hope it benefitted you with your deen. And I just want to say if you're struggling to quit music, it's okay. We all have our shortcomings and struggles, and it's pretty hard not to be hooked onto music these days with that kind of fitnah all around us. As long as you have made that intention that is great because Allah is aware of what is in your heart, Alhamdulillah, make dua to him asking for help and may He make you struggle in quitting music easier. And those of you who have quit listening to music and it's out of your life (from what you can control) completely, may Allah bless you, continue to guide you, and may He make the rest of the Ummah as strong as you are when it comes to music. I also just want to add, that there is a legitimate difference of opinion among scholars on the permissibility of music- please respect that, and if somebody doesn't follow the opinion you agree, please address it in a respectful manner. Lastly, May Allah bless and continue to guide all you brothers and sisters out there, may He accept every spoken and unspoken dua from your heart, may He make all your dreams become your reality, may He strengthen you in your deen and bless you for all your shortcomings that you have and are overcoming and your strong points too, and may He just give you the best noor in your heart ever, make walking the siraat easy for you, may He grant you the best of this dunya and Jannah, and grant you the highest level of Jannah. Ameen.\n\nIf you have any additions or recommendations to this post, feel free to share in the comments below, for everybody Inshallah :) You'll get good deeds from it :P\n\nOh and if you're looking for more motivation to quit music I recommend these videos:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwnUIYAGJeI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwnUIYAGJeI)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLCJIwhdWjc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLCJIwhdWjc)\n\nAssalamualaikum :)"

                "body": "Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh sisters and brothers,\n\nAll Glory is to Allah, and all Praise is to Him. Glorified is Allah, the Great. Ya Allah please send infinite blessings and salutations to the Prophet Muhammad (saw) and his loved ones. In the name of Allah, the most Compassionate, most Merciful.\n\nOriginally, I wrote this post but as I read it- it just felt so bitter and angry- and that's not the way a Muslim's character should be, no matter what has happened. We should remain thankful to Allah for everything that has happened to us, because it was His Qadr and what was best for us, even if it means we're not where we wished we were right now. So I deleted the post, and I'm rewriting, because Allah deserved better than to see me write a bitter angry sounding post about how things are turning or have turned out. His Qadr is perfection, because Allah makes no mistakes. So I'm not where I want to be right now, and I'm not exactly thrilled with a lot that has happened in my life, but it was clearly the best thing that could have happened because it was the Qadr of Allah so I'm grateful even if I don't understand why or my initial feeling is to dislike this, I'm still grateful because my story is written by the Best Of All Planners, and I trust Him wholeheartedly, and astaghfirullah if I've ever been ungrateful for what He willed for me. \n\nLast night was one of those nights when I just stayed up thinking about a lot... About the future. I was in a really bad place yesterday because I was thinking how successful everybody I know is, compared to me. For context, I've failed my A-Levels and my friends did not and they're all excited to go to university and preparing for it, meanwhile I spend my nights crying about the thought of results day and how I'm going to handle things with my dad on that day when he finds out I failed everything.\n\nThen I began to question everything. What is it that I want to do? I don't know. I say cyber security but am I saying that because I want to do it or because my dad wants me to do it? In all honesty, I don't know. I do enjoy computer science, but I also enjoy my other subjects too.\n\nAnd yes, I want a high paying career- who doesn't? But I want it to be more than just that. I want a career in which I'm able to do good, and help people, help the Muslim Ummah with my position, give Muslims and especially Muslim women the kind of representation we deserve, to show that just because I cover my hair doesn't mean I cover my brain, and Islam is what liberates me, not oppresses me. I really really want to do good with my career. \n\nAnd don't get me wrong, with cyber security I can definitely do good- given I'd be helping to make the online world safer for everybody in some kind of way. But if I do cyber security, I want to study it because I truly looked at all my options and figured it was the best most intriguing subject for me. And I can't be convinced that is the reason I've picked cyber security yet, because I haven't properly explored my other options because my dad seemed so happy with me doing this, I just wanted to please him and make him proud of me like he used to be.\n\nTruthfully, I don't know what I want to do anymore. I'm looking at psychology but I'm not entirely certain. And part of me is scared that I'll choose the wrong thing and regret it for the rest of my life, but then part of me remembers if I make continuous dua about this particular situation, that Allah will not let me down and He will guide me to what is best for me, and just like that I'm not scared anymore.\n\nWhat I'm trying to ask you brothers and sisters, is that make dua for me too? That I make the right decision? That my career will bring me joy, help me do good in this dunya for the sake of Allah, and that I won't regret whatever choice I make. And also make dua for yourselves too, because you deserve it. \n\nI thought by the time I got to this age, I'd have it all figured out, that I'd be beautiful, know what I want to do in my life- but here I am completely clueless and scared about most things. I can't help but feel like an absolute failure compared to my friends, I feel so pathetic that they're planning the next stage of their adult lives and I'm still like a pathetic child worried about getting shouted at by my dad for failing.\n\nOh and also, I want to stay away from Riba. I want a university education, because that's my best shot at earning a higher income, and helping to give my future children better opportunities than what I had- but I want to avoid Riba- in the UK student loans have interest, and it breaks my heart- because it just feels like I'm trapped- like if I don't go to university, I will be earning the same income as my family- which means I probably won't be able to afford Hajj, and give my children better opportunities, and if I do I'm committing a major sin... I just... It's... Yeah. I want to avoid Riba and still go to university somehow so that's another thing I ask you to make dua for me for- that I can avoid Riba and still go to university somehow. I don't know how but all I know is that Allah is with the patient so I will continue to be patient, and seek help through patience and prayer and Inshallah He will create a way for me.\n\nAnd before I get anyone saying to me: \"Oh but you're a woman you don't have to provide or worry about finances that's your husband's responsibility, your priority should be being a homemaker\" and while yes, that is true and when I get married my number one priority will be looking after my family, the truth is we do not live in a just world. If my (future) husband gets poorly or hurt and genuinely can't provide- then obviously I will have to step up and provide for us until he gets better. If my husband dies, and we've had children I will still need to provide for them because he won't be around. And those are just worse case scenarios. These days even though providing is a man's responsibility, realistically because of the unjust world we live in, it's really difficult for one person to provide everything. I don't want my children to have to worry about whether they will be able to afford to go to Hajj or have the thought of Riba even crossing their minds when it comes to their education. And when a woman earns it's her money, and it's up to her how she spends her money, and personally, I'd want to spend it on my family, things such as my future children's education so they don't have to worry the way I do. Khadija (may Allah be pleased with her) helped the Prophet Muhammad (saw) with her wealth when he needed it, and I want to do the same for my husband if he ever needs my help. So please, don't get pressed at the fact I want a career.\n\nWith all that said jazakallah khairan for reading this post, and please do keep me in your duas especially about avoiding Riba, oh and please make dua that results day will be easy for me too, and if you have any dua requests feel free to post them in the comments and I will more than happily include you in my duas too- we should never be stingy with our duas :)\n\nAssalamualaikum :)"

I feel like it\u2019s just such a quiet and intimate space where I can be alone with my thoughts and my duas.\n\nLast night I truly began to appreciate it, because I was making dua after Fajr, and I was getting emotional because why wouldn\u2019t I be lol? But as I was doing that (I was in the living room and I\u2019m sharing the living room with my brother temporarily) my brother looked at me lol, and I just don\u2019t like making emotional duas in front of anyone other than Allah lol, so it sort of killed my vibe.\n\nAnd that just kinda reminded me that Allah sometimes takes things away from you to increase your gratitude. Because sometimes you don\u2019t realize how good something is until it\u2019s been taken away.\n\nAnyways what is your favourite place to pray?"

                "body": "Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh sisters and brothers,\n\nBefore you come at me and be like: \u201cBut everyone is born Muslim\u201d yes, I know Mashallah but I\u2019m just using the term \u201cborn Muslim\u201d to refer to those who were born into a Muslim family, for the sake of convenience.\n\nAll the time I see born Muslims on TikTok and social media and all my friends who are born Muslims- celebrating Eid and talking about how they celebrate. And the thing is as somebody who is a born Muslim I could never relate to any of them. I remember being younger and astaghfirullah, I used to lie about how we celebrated Eid as a family so I didn\u2019t look like the odd one out.\n\nLike I\u2019ve never attended the Masjid for Eid prayer, I don\u2019t receive lots of Eid money, most years I don\u2019t receive any, I don\u2019t see extended family, if things are going good with my family I\u2019ll get some new clothes and my mum will make some nice food (Samosas, Kebabs, Pakoras, and we might get some Pakistani sweets and a cake) but if things aren\u2019t so good it\u2019ll just be like a regular day, and if things are really bad there\u2019s definitely going to be a big argument of some kind lol.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not complaining or feeling ungrateful, I understand there are so many more people out there who genuinely suffer during Eid and it\u2019s heartbreaking. It\u2019s just that I want to know if there\u2019s anyone else out there who doesn\u2019t really celebrate Eid properly because it\u2019s just this time of year I feel sort of isolated from most people, because I hear they\u2019re having fun with their families, taking loads of Eid pics and stuff and I just can\u2019t relate. And I wonder if there\u2019s anyone else out there born into a Muslim family who has experiences with Eid similar to mine?\n\nRealistically I probably won\u2019t be celebrating Eid properly until I get married (or if I even manage to lol)- that\u2019s my view but you never know, Allah always sends us blessings I never saw coming.\n\nAny other born Muslims relate?"

The twelve signs of the zodiac are always \u201caspecting\u201d each other - - viewing or existing conversationally in one way or another. Planets become energized by these aspects of signs, which can be more or less benefic (trine and sextile), malefic (opposition and square), or a  powerhouse of a wild card depending on the combination of planets involved (conjunction). \n\nThrough the years of studying astrology, I\u2019ve seen a great number of astrologers downplay the beauty of the sextile. The conjunction, the opposition, the trine, and the square are all payed adequate homage to, yet the sextile is either lumped in as a simpler satellite to the trine, downplayed as fundamentally weak, in league with minor aspects, or an aspect that shouldn\u2019t be examined at all unless its orb of influence is particularly tight. \n\nI feel this is a great mistake. For one, the sextile IS a major aspect. According to the Thema Mundi, it carries the nature of beautiful planet Venus, because Venus-ruled Libra forms a sextile with Sun-ruled Leo, and we never, ever downplay Venus, smitten with every good thing she affords us. Sextile signs are of different modalities but the same polarity - - like people from neighboring nations with different cultures coming together to achieve a common goal. So incidentally, the gifts granted by the sextile are not automatically available to you like they are with the trine, and instead have to be discovered, explored, and cultivated.\n\nIn some ways, I feel this can be more powerful than the trine, the aspect lorded over by the greater benefic, Jupiter. Why? Because when blessings and talents are so readily given without being tempered by active cultivation, it can dampen the motivation to *work* towards something with those gifts. Hence the trine being associated with laziness. \n\nImagine if you will, a person born into considerable wealth, having never needed to work for said wealth yet benefiting from it as their birthright. That would be akin to the trine, the greater gift. Now picture a person born into a middle or lower-class family, but possessing gifts that have the potential to accrue substantial wealth for the native IF they discover what those gifts are, and work towards cultivating them and bringing them to light. That is the sextile, the lesser gift. We tend to prefer the former, but the latter has its place. \n\nThe sextile, like the trine, is a beneficial aspect, but comes with its own energy and blessings, not to be confused or combined with that of the trine. I believe sextiles are more important than what they are currently given credit for. And I feel that people should not gloss over their sextiles, but study them and work out the buried gifts and talents that they are promising."

The thing about the hat is that I needed it for an activity later that day and if I didn't bring it I'd have some penalties for absence of material. It wouldn't be the first time, either. So when I looked into the bag and didn't see it there I freaked out a bit. He then gave me back my hat and still in the panicked mode I was rude and told him \"I didn't like it. I didn't like that you took my hat and hid it. What I keep in my bag is mine and I don't like people touching that, okay?\". He then said it was meant as a joke and that I took it too seriously. I didn't say anything else. \n\nThe following day I asked if he was mad but he brushed me off. When I tried sitting next to him he ignored me completely. It was as if he didn't want me around, so I decided to not say anything for a couple days and let things cool off so we could talk about it later.\n\nThis morning I tried to talk to him about it but he said he was deeply hurt that I had that attitude with him, that he was disappointed and never expected such an attitude from me. I tried to tell him I wasn't mad at him, rather at his attitude. He kept insisting I shouldn't have spoken to him like that and that none of his friends ever spoke to him like that or that he would never do that to someone. I apologised and said that I had had a bad day until that point and that the hat was important to me because if I didn't have it I'd get in trouble with my superiors. He insisted I shouldn't have spoken to him the way I did and we've been texting about this for the last 2 hours. I just don't know what else I can say to make him understand that it wasn't my real intention to be rude to him. "

I heard a lot of things against me and I know they\u2019re just projections but being pregnant I\u2019m super hormonal and emotional. (Things like she hates me, she hates my dog, I don\u2019t care about my dog and she deserves better, she doesn\u2019t care about our child, she hates how I ignore her complaining and I just get rid of the problem, she\u2019s tired of \u201ctrying not to offend\u201d me, etc)\n\nShe got back at my pettiness by giving us 30 days to get out and talking shit about me, my child, and my dog. I really tried to get along with her before this. I thought she liked me well enough. I didn\u2019t want it to come to this, I just wanted to make a point. Now my husband is bracing to go no contact and we\u2019re scrambling to find a place ASAP instead of staying here where I particularly no longer feel safe.\n\nAlso what is with their generation hating the younger ones for setting hard boundaries but go fucking crazy when they don\u2019t get their way??"

The management acts like I'm rude and an inconvenience for bringing up things I'm told to let them know about. There's a lot of forced positivity, and the people who actually made working there at least tolerable have left. \n\nI've been told I'd be fired for discussing my paycheck, workplace atmosphere, or haven't a problem with someone who doesn't do their job with anyone else who works there. I get consistently blamed for things I didn't do. I only get paid *up to* $400 (it's usually more like $250) every 2 weeks and they won't add more hours. I've gone into delinquent status on all my accounts to pay, three times in the three months I've worked there. I can barely cover my bills. Working here is literally killing me. We have a mandatory meeting on Sunday to \"celebrate\" a cook's birthday. Our \"work chat\" is a Facebook messenger group. There's so much forced positivity it's permeating the walls. Everyone *has* to act happy or they'll get mistreated.\n\nI come home and the atmosphere is almost the same (I had to move back with my family during COVID-19, but now I can't get a job good enough to move back out). I've applied to a bunch of entry level positions in different fields and they all have ignored me or ask for experience (wtf is with that? It's *entry level*). It's been two months since I started looking and I'm no closer to getting out of this hellhole than I was going in. \n\nI'm just so tired and stressed out and mentally not ok, and no one around me seems to see that."

(It was an online interracial relationship that would probably not work out in the end which is why we discussed and he broke up with me in the first place)\n\nIt's been 3 months since the break up and there were a few times I blew up cuz I couldn't stand the 'just friends-but a little more than friends-but not lovers' atmosphere anymore. And during those times, I said hurtful words to him, really bad ones. But he kept on trying to be friends with me.\n\nA few days ago, I destroyed a gift I was going to give him if we ever meet. He was sad when he found out about it. But he still wanted to be friends regardless of it. I only destroyed that to clear up the confusion. But his reaction, I don't understand this Pisces mind anymore. I thought he would be completely over me, might even grow to hate me after all this. But that wasn't the case. He's currently talking with a new girl tho but nth has happened yet. But that's even more of the reason to cut off with me for good.\n\nAny idea why a pisces would go so far just to be friends with an ex?\nfor any useful info, I'm a leo sun with leo rising.

We lost contact for 6 months but we have been catching up & talking often from social media lately. A few days ago, he came to ask me to become his duty partner at a charity work. I refused saying I wasn't interested in its job description but he kept insisting me so I agreed in the end. The work contained 24 hour shifts but we didn't mind as we are both from the medical field. \n\nAt first, both of us decided not to show up at the orientation day bcuz were were lazy. But the next day, a few hours before the actual orientation, he texted me that he just woke up and that he would go to the orientation & I should join him. I said no (lol) since I only woke up too. He kept persuading me like the orientation wouldn't last long & that it could be fun. I finally gave in & said I would be going. \n\nThe orientation indeed didn't take much time. After that he asked me to hang out with him a bit at a cafe. (Actually, he asked everyone around if they wanted to hang out but they obviously refused as they only knew us for a few hours) so only two of us were left. We ordered bubble tea at a cafe and talked for hours about life & future. He admitted that he asked me first before going out to call his male friends for this volunteer partner which sounded surprising, but understandable considering our past compatibility as partners. I told him he could leave first but he waited until my home came to pick me up. \n\nWe have finished our first 24-hour shift at the place and there are a few weird things I wanna add, his current acts that were different from the past. (He hanged around me the whole day but I won't state it as weird since I was his partner after all. But he could be doing different stuff instead of following me everywhere almost all the time) When he wants to call me, he would poke or tap me instead of plainly just saying my name. He would unconsciously copy my gestures like if I'm sitting hugging my knees, he did the same a few moments later. When I was reading something, he would look over my shoulders from behind, close to my face. When I had no where else to sit, he didn't give up his seat but squeezed to one side & offered me half of the space to sit with him.\n\nMaybe he was just being nice and as a normal istp would act around his friends. But I think I'm also a bit interested in him lately & that's why i might be noticing normal behaviours as 'signs' & overthinking stuff. Please give me opinions & advice if possible."

All I've been doing is sleeping, video games, tiktok, reddit and occasional Netflix all day last few months and it's fucking awful. Maybe it's my adhd? I've been diagnosed with the Inattentive type last August but I'm not on any meds. I have family history of addiction on both side of the family. On my mother's side excessive drinking and on my father's side is drugs and a few uncles have died due to drug related issues hence my hesitation with meds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've lost all interest in everything now. I haven't played guitar in almost 2 months it's just sitting in my collecting dust, my friend's birthday is coming up and he wants to do something but I'm dreading even leaving my home, I quit my job cause the journey to and from work was just exhausting and the people were just getting on my nerves. As for school I've never been good at exams but I have a lot of useless knowledge that I have put to good use before. Like I used to be a writer of short stories and such. I was in the newspaper a couple times cause of it. Basically I'm really good with my hands but these days I hate doing anything.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext week my culinary class starts back again but I've been thinking about dropping it but I don't really want to but my brain is saying it's the only good option. I don't want to make this too long so yea that's it I guess. I just don't have the will to do anything anymore."

From what I can remember I started doing to avoid school work in primary school. You see I absolutely HATED doing revision or doing work with my mother cause she had no patience and I used to get beat a lot. Eventually I would mostly do well in things I somewhat liked and others I put no effort. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm also really good at troubleshooting and finding loop holes. The thing is I've been masking and living my life on auto pilot for so long I don't know how to live not doing it...make sense? I've entered the adult world and I am working and training for my career however I've had 4 panic attacks over the last year or so due to pushing myself and being overwhelmed. My job said I needed to get a doctor's letter stating I'm fit to work hence how I ended up in therapy. My homework for this week is about masking and ways to break out of it. Any tips?"

I've seen it in comments under other videos as well mentioning he was high on The Word. I've watched and compared this performance to the SNL one a couple months and I don't see it. Was he atleast stoned or full on flying high for The Word? \n\n\n\nTo me it just looked like he was enjoying the moment. What do you guys think? Any source to back it up?"

This happens everytime hence why I don't drink much coffee but it was the first time I did it at night. I was out like a light! Didn't wake up til around midnight. However I had trouble falling back to sleep. I spent most of the time pacing in my room or forcing myself to sleep. I made food, watched a lil TV and scroll through reddit for a while yet nothing. Next thing yk it's 6:20am and the sun is out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot the first time my sleep just stops in the middle of the night. There are many times when I'd just wake up between 12-3 am no matter what time I go to bed and not fall back to sleep and continue on my day. Most days I get on average 6 hours of sleep. Others I'll get 4 or less. Also I don't sleep in spurts like I get up and sleep and then get up again etc. It's more like I wake up and my brain decides that's enough sleeping. How do you guys cope with this?"

Like hitting the octave. Yes Kurt sang just by going off on how he felt but he consistently can make his voice blend beautifully with the music. Even when he's just humming it creates this beautiful blend of sound. It has got me thinking if he had perfect pitch or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried Google but everything seems to talking about his technique and octave range not about his pitch."

My boss and boss's boss only had a HS diplomas, felt threatened by this and framed me for a costly programming error. A co-worker who was far more savvy than I in office politics mad a tape copy of the logs proving I was innocent and I put the copy in the storage room, but he said \"don't assume their treachery ends here. If I were you I'd make a hard copy too\", so I did. The next day the tape was gone. The day after I had my meeting with the two bosses to get my reprimand and produced the hard copy. But this is how rotten to the core the place was. My boss's boss said (I'm paraphrasing) \"You think that matters? I've fired people before just because I can and that's what's going to happen to you. Take your little piece of paper to HR. Do you think they'll care? Take it to the union. I've been friends with your union rep for over twenty years.\" So I took the reprimand, knowing more--and a firing--were coming.\n\nBut wait. About a month later our COO left for the private sector and the new COO made massive budget cuts, RIF-ing a lot of people, including the person who said she was going to fire me just for fun. She and her husband were building a huge house, and when she lost her job the money shortfall caused a divorce. The house was only half finished and they couldn't afford to finish it, and they couldn't sell it bc no one wanted to buy a half finished custom house. So this piece of shit lost everything. I left about a year later anyway. An awful place to work but I guess karma is real.",

                "body": "\n\u2022\tHow old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.\n\n30/F. Stay at home mom. I\u2019m never sure what to say about myself lol. \n\n\u2022\tIs there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?\n\nI have been diagnosed with both depression and anxiety. \n\n\u2022\tDescribe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?\n\nReligion? No, not at all. My mom is a firm atheist, and my dad always considered himself agnostic. It was a bit chaotic, and kind of fell apart in my pre-teen years, but ya know lol. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?\n\nI\u2019m a stay-at-home mom. I love my kids more than life itself, but I don\u2019t love being a SAHM. I struggle with boredom and lack of purpose. I feel like I\u2019m not accomplishing anything with my life. I come from a family of doctors and lawyers, so being a stay at home mom often feels like I am far lesser. I am constantly plagued with mom guilt though, so I always feel like I should be doing more for them and not sending them to daycare. \n\n\u2022\tIf you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?\n\nGlorious. Refreshed. I would kill to have that much time of quiet where I didn\u2019t have to worry about anything. I could get so much done. Or nothing done?! I don\u2019t even know. But I would love it. \n\n\u2022\tWhat kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?\n\nI have never been a sports person. I tried a few as a kid and always felt like the odd man out. In college I did start working out and thoroughly enjoyed swimming. I designed my own workouts and loved how it allowed me to just clear my head. I hate the outdoors though. I am very much an indoors kind of person. \n\n\u2022\tHow curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?\n\nI\u2019m very curious. I always tell my husband one of my hobbies is just learning new things. I can (and do) spend countless hours learning about a subject that interests me. I have lots of ideas too. So many that I try to write them down to keep track of them. Definitely more than I can realistically execute. They tend to be things I want to accomplish \u2014 ideas for my Etsy shop, projects I want to do around the house. \n\n\u2022\tWould you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?\n\nAs a kid the word probably most used to describe me was \u201cBossy\u201d lol (that and \u201cold soul\u201d) but I would say I definitely do not enjoy being in a leadership role. I don\u2019t like the responsibility or knowing that people would be relying on me. I would prefer to rely solely on myself. I think I would probably try to find specific sets of tasks and delegate them out to people. That\u2019s how I am with my kids, and how I would be if I ever hired someone to help with my Etsy. I don\u2019t like helicopter parenting; I much prefer to let my kids play independently, and have been called a \u201cfree range\u201d parent because of this. \n\n\u2022\tAre you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?\n\nNot particularly? I like some small menial tasks that I can do with my hands, but I would not consider myself a very physically-oriented person. I am much more in my head. \n\n\u2022\tAre you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.\n\nI enjoy creativity tremendously and always wanted to be some kind of \u201ccreator\u201d. In high school I wanted to be a writer. I don\u2019t think of myself as very creative though. I know that probably seems really contradictory. I\u2019ve always loved art though. In college I visited the MoMA in New York and it was amazing. My husband loves \u201cart\u201d from like craft stores, but I tend to prefer authentic art and used to have a few Picasso posters on my wall. Recently I\u2019ve been getting more into kitschy pieces if they fit into a certain theme I\u2019m going for. \n\n\u2022\tWhat's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?\n\nThe past tends to just feel sad to me. Either a reminder of something that\u2019s over, or a reminder of something crappy that happened in the past. I\u2019m not very sentimental.  I tend to get lost in the present. It\u2019s really hard for me to focus on what is going on around me. I either get overwhelmed and anxious or lost and drift away because I\u2019m focused on something else. I think about the future a lot. Goals. Dreams. Plans. I spend a lot of time planning. \n\n\u2022\tHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?\n\nUgh lol. I don\u2019t like helping people. I don\u2019t want anyone to rely on me. To the point I would say that\u2019s something I struggle with a lot as a parent. I want to tell them to figure it out on their own lol. I will help with some things though, because I know it\u2019s the right thing to do. \n\n\u2022\tDo you need logical consistency in your life?\n\nI prefer it, but I guess my feelings on this differ depending on the context. This feels like a pretty vague question. People can be pretty illogical and inconsistent, but I understand  that. There\u2019s usually a reason behind it. \n\n\u2022\tHow important is efficiency and productivity to you?\n\nI love efficiency. And I like to feel productive. When I give my children tasks to do, I try to explain to them the most efficient way to do it. Of course, they never listen lol, but at least I try. \ud83d\ude02 productivity is complicated for me, because I would say I have a tendency to be a bit lazy. I don\u2019t like cleaning, but I very much enjoy accomplishing things. It\u2019s hard trying to balance these. \ud83e\udd23\n\n\u2022\tDo you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?\n\nI can be a bit controlling. Mostly in times of conflict I can feel like I just want things to be a certain way to help me feel more in control of my environment. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your hobbies? Why do you like them?\n\nI have an Etsy shop that I make candles and wax melts and a few bath products for. It\u2019s an opportunity for me to be creative and also feel like I\u2019m accomplishing something. \n\n\u2022\tWhat is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?\n\nI learn by reading. I\u2019m a very visual learner. Show me and explain it to me\u2026in text. I can\u2019t listen to videos explaining or audio books because I don\u2019t process like 80% of what is said. My favorite classes in college were my psychology classes and my foreign language classes. \n\n\u2022\tHow good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?\n\nI like planning. It helps me organize my thoughts to get them written down and broken down into more manageable and organized pieces. Otherwise it feels like a flood in my head and gets really overwhelming. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?\n\nI really want to own my own business. Like take my Etsy shop and make it into a full-blown shop that keeps me super busy. I also want to own a bigger home. \n\n\u2022\tWhat are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?\n\nI loathe confrontation. I really fear judgement from other people, like a sometimes paralyzing fear of it. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"highs\" in your life look like?\n\nHmm. A good day for me is one where I feel very accomplished. I check off lots of things off my to do list. \n\n\u2022\tWhat do the \"lows\" in your life look like?\n\nDepressed. Melancholy. Shutting myself away from other people. \n\n\u2022\tHow attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?\n\nI daydream all the time. My husband says I\u2019ll get this glazed over look on my face and just kind of disappear and get really quiet. \n\n\u2022\tImagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?\n\nIdk, everything lol. I guess as long as I knew I was safe and there was nothing to be scared of I would just kind of get lost in my thoughts like I usually do. I think about people in my life, problems, goals, ideas, something I\u2019ve been reading about a lot lately\u2026. Anything. \n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?\n\nForever. I hate making decisions. I hate closing that door and tend to wait until the last minute or let someone else decide. \n\n\u2022\tHow long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?\n\nMy husband has said at my worst I am a Type 4 enneagram, and at my best a type 5. In little problems I can usually take a few quiet moments, read into some insight and figure it out. But I can also very quickly get swept away by my feelings if I let them get the best of me. They sometimes feel like a very powerful force that is hard to control. \n\n\u2022\tDo you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?\n\nYes sometimes, because I hate confrontation. I would say I never like wholeheartedly agree just for the sake of peace. If I disagree but don\u2019t want to argue I will just tend to get quiet. \n\n\u2022\tDo you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?\n\nAs a teenager I did. A lot. But now, not so much. Breaking the rules seems like asking for a confrontation which I would rather avoid. I don\u2019t think authority necessarily knows better than me, just that they have a set of rules they follow and I would rather not argue."

The blue ones are from my original batch, the red ones are from the new batch. The 464 is the same in both. This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen. I spoke with 3 candle supply companies today and none of them had anything useful to say about it. \n\nMy wax melts from the old batch all came out matte in texture, smooth, creamy, beautiful. My new ones from the new batch are glossy and shiny and cracking and what looks like... Frosting? Or mottling? I'm not even sure. \n\nI tried upping the soy percentage as per recommendation of one of the distributors. It is a lot less frosty looking but still completely glossy and shiny. I'm so upset. I have almost a full case of each and was finally ready to start selling as I had finally perfected my product, then I get hit with this mess. Any thoughts, advice, are very much appreciated."

He wanted space so I respected that and gave him enough space because I care about him, sadly he never returned, so I assumed that nothing mattered between us anymore, so I let go. I texted him to see if something was up and nothing. Never heard of him again. \n\nI still believe I must\u2019ve done something wrong for him to just leave me there, even today. I was probably too much to handle and that might\u2019ve made him easily stressed out, so he had no choice but to cut me off for his own mental health. \n\nThat\u2019s understandable and a very healthy thing to do actually but I still don\u2019t like the idea of being hanged with the thought of not knowing what happened.

It was the complete opposite of what I thought it would be.\n\nThe cost of living there is typically about quadruple what it is here (so thus, the need to pay your employees more money) and compounded to that is renting space for restaurants to set up shop is also pretty expensive down there, so I had anticipated to pay about 3-5 times the amount to eat out in San Diego vs here.\n\nIf it had been just one restaurant, my mind definitely would have instantly gone to employee wages for sure, but it was pretty steady across the board for the places we ate at (I think all but two out of the ten places were a non-franchised, locally-owned eatery). But then again, I could definitely see a situation where the servers and other employees in the restaurant business throughout that region are getting paid bare minimum and nothing else, especially if there aren't many jobs available and a lot of individuals scrambling for employment.\n\nSo...I guess what I'm saying is you might be totally on-point.

(San Diego being at $15.50) and as far as I could ascertain, ingredient pricing seems to be in similar ballparks as well (i.e. a pound of beef in Washington is about the same as in California), so...why?? Why are the restaurants so crazy expensive around here?\n\nFor our trip, I was so worried that eating in California for a week would take a wrecking ball to our food budget, but it turned out okay, I just had a badly skewed view because prepared food is simply exorbitantly overpriced for seemingly no reason at all here in Washington.\n\n** End rant **",

She thought we'd do just fine since my sister was a teenager and I was a university student. Big mistake!\n\nWe were allowed to order whatever we wanted off the menu, so long as it stayed at a reasonable price. Instead of lunch, my sister opted for a giant (and I mean just gargantuan) slice of chocolate cake that happened to have a few gold shavings on it. I can't remember what I ordered (it's irrelevant anyhow).\n\nSo, we're chowing down on our food when this older woman (who honestly was on the obese end of the scale) toddles past us. As she does, she makes eye contact with my sister (who's mouth is full of chocolate cake) and leans toward the table. She says to my sister in a gravelly, loud whisper, \"If you keep eating like that, you'll end up looking like me someday!\"\n\nCue my sister spewing half-eaten chocolate cake all over my plate as she tries (and fails) to contain her shock and laughter, which immediately causes me to spit take the water I was in the middle of sipping.\n\nThe table was a mess. Chocolate, some gold flecks, and water everywhere. My poor mother was so embarrassed! By the time my sister and I had regained out composure, the lady was long gone. It was another 10+ years after that incident that my mom was finally brave enough to take us to a nice, fancy place again.",

I vaguely knew what time they'd arrive, but being blind I had no way of looking at a clock to read the exact time. Regardless, when I heard a knock at the door, I felt confident it was the person I was waiting for. I put on my dark sunglasses and answered.\n\nIt was not the person I thought it was.\n\nAn unfamiliar man's voice broke into some sob story about his brother with \"some kind of autism\" and then asked me if I'd like to purchase a product \"his company\" sells. \n\nFeeling weirded out, I shook my head no and told him that due to my legal blindness (Hello! I'm wearing giant dark sunglasses!), our family's budget was tight and we did not have money to make frivolous purchases.\n\nThe guy suddenly changed tracks and said, \"If you need money, you could join my team! It's very profitable and only takes $200 to join. It's super easy, you just go door-to-door!\"\n\nI shook my head and said, \"That is literally what I can't do right now. I'm legally blind and would probably get hit by a car trying to navigate the streets on my own.\"\n\n\"You could call people, instead of door-to-door, then. Trust me, it's a great business opportunity.\"\n\n\"How would I dial? I can't see the buttons on the phone or read a piece of paper with numbers on it?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" It finally hit the weirdo that he being the biggest sales-pitch/recruiting sleazeball on the planet. He finally left.\n\nI often wonder about that guy. In our back and forth, he did mention he lived just up the street from me. I'll never know if it's true because I never saw what he looked like, but I hope it is true and that he feels guilty every time he sees me on the street."

I did get a few friends from school, but my school life was pretty uneventful.\n\nNow though, my friends have all left, and my parents don't want me anymore either since I am not a \"cute wittle toddler!\" Anymore, blegh...\n\nI'll get to the point now, I woke up 5 days ago, but I had no idea where I was needed, I am sensing somewhere on the road near my home... but I didn't understand how could I be needed there, I'd understand if I was needed near the sidewalk, but on the road, where the cars drive? It's odd, but I guess I'll have to check it out\n\nSo I walk to the road, and the exact location I was needed at was on the road, a few meters away from the road crossing area.

I tripped on a rock that was on the path and fell.\n\nShe was now standing over me, and she started screaming \"THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FOR RUINING EVERYTHING!\" And then she stabbed me, it hurt badly, but after a while everything went black.\n\nI woke up at the hospital, apparently someone was outside on a walk and found me bleeding there.\n\nI still didn't understand what she meant when she said that I ruined everything, but I knew I was going to find out soon enough, and whatever I did or will do wrong, I am not happy about it...

Lots of times I got hyped up for a battle scene only to have it switch out to something else entirely, then come back and carnage already be underway after my hype already died. Makes it hard to digest if that makes sense.\nPlus there was a lot of dialogue that would have been better off turned into internal monologue for better immersion.\n\nZero has almost all strong points from source material (gun urobuchi the goat) to direction to animation and UBW anime doesn't translate the same way. The fights are godlike though and I still enjoy the hell out of it to this day.",

I didn't bother wanting to tell anybody else. Probably they won't really care ... Seriously, I honestly just couldn't handle the idea of being so hooked onto social media anymore and the subliminal social comparison as well. Too many lurkers who check out my content when I already unfollowed them previously. Very so tired of it. Esp the superficial friendships/relationships with people.  I'm not even personally close connections with more than half of them. Not sure if it is just me, but no joke feels like social media is everyone's own virtual reality tv show. Not to mention that the holidays are coming up.\\~ Well, that's just great. On top of social indicators and the analytics behind the platforms. Way too overwhelming.  Once I unplugged Facebook and Instagram, I really feel a liberated rebel. LOL Overall, for now, I'm taking a break from them while I take the time to focus on my priorities.

I used the super absorption w/ the applicator since I am a heavy flow. First attempt, really hurt like a mother f***er. I didn\u2019t angle my tampon properly and I think it hit ones of my nerves. I felt really consciousness when walking. Few tips: always angle about 45 degrees and don\u2019t push the plunder so early. What also worked for me (gross) too is relying on my middle and ring fingers to find that vaginal hole. But yeah, I usually wear pads. I honestly am so sick of the moisture and the sogginess under my pants.. Likely just wear pads before I go to bed. Thanks for reading!"

The first time even posting on here, so this is by far huge for me. A week later... Yes, I am experiencing flashbacks of my childhood. I'd say my memories from 10 to 17 years old, my adolescence. I honestly hated my years as a minor despite that I didn't experience the best childhood.  From being bullied, a shy loner, no therapy, self-consciousness, etc. After I got more in touch with my inner child, I did compensate for that emotional pain by crying myself to sleep last night. Sure, there were more of the bad memories, but the good parts too. I am grateful to reconnect with my younger self at least and more motivated to overthrown my temptations /urges. In terms of childhood flashbacks, is this supposed to happen? Maybe. Hope I'm not the only one.  My goal is to aim NoFap at least 90 days. I can do this."

This means I want the user to need to *hold Ctrl and Shift while* they press Q twice in short succession in order for the `shutdown -L` command to run. I wasn't able to find anything that achieved this in the documentation or a web search, so I was hoping I could get some help here.\n\nAdditional comments are appreciated \u2014 I'm here to learn, not just copy and paste :) thanks in advance!"

I wondered what he meant and asked my dad but he jst told me I  was too young to know. He stayed true to his words cause a few days after, the coup happened. The next thing we knew, there was a protest either against him or something else (I can't seem to remember)by the ppl who were mentioned in the above article; apparently no one knew they had got beaten up until their protesting clip showed a lady in a neck brace and women's rights activists proclaiming justice. It made headlines and everyone remembered the name of the victims. Note: ask any Fijian about the 2006 victims of military abuse and they will say those names in less than 5 seconds flat. I am sorry if my info isn't accurate cause I was young and didn't know wtf the present PM was saying at that time, let alone knew what was going on in the country so my info could be mixed with other incidents.

After that Lucci. these are the only 2 who aren't villains. mere antagonists, as the post says. akainu, sure he does messed up things, but he just wishes to keep the peace. Pirates are a huge threat. He doesn't have time to look at which pirate is good or bad because he has a job to do. He also has a good reason in that all pirates inherently break the law. It's basically like saying the chief of police is evil for doing his job. and lucci is a psychopath, not a good person, but he was just following orders. Except for fighting luffy, but that aside from bloodlust, could also be given the motive of killing someone deemed an enemy. Charlos is also an evil fuck, but when literally everyone says \"we are gods, better than the mere peasants\" from before you were even born you will be like this; also inbreeding doesn't help with this. as for the worst, enel. the pure racist assholes of arlong and hody jones are terrible, blackbeard is an unknown factor, kaido is just a big strong guy who wants to do evil, spandam is an arrogant little bitch, judge is the worst father I've seen in a while, Vergo, I don't even remember much of his backstory, doflamingo and crocodile are both powerhungry and corrupt, Wapot wants his kingdom back, a coward, ceasar is a demon of hell. enel is the worst because he thinks he is a GOD. To those who think that makes him justified, since he actually thought he was a GOD, he could actually try to help people. instead of nuking the entire island. \n\nadd on for Akainu, he is actually good. in dnd terms, lawful neutral is his alignment, he will follow evil orders, and do evil, but he does it for the sake of the law. that alone is a moral thing. for the reason that order is imortant in a society. Pirates are an evil. that includes luffy. because he inspires people to take up the pirate life, which leads to chaos. and chaos leads to more kaido, arlong, eustass kidd, big mom, I can go on. So akainu is trying to do good, and he fought aokiji because of 1 reason. He is too soft. akainu has deserved concerns about a guy like him becoming fleet admiral. He wants to actually deal with the problem. though he isn't able to because of the gorosei.",

The only real hardware coursework I had was computer architecture, which I really liked but didn't have the chance to pursue further on account of not being in a CE program. \n\nWhat's the best way to get caught up on that side of things?

I couldn't find much in the way of beginner materials for Vulkan but I could for D3D 12. \n\nI'm not sure what I should do to get off the ground with 3D graphics code ASAP because I learn best by doing things myself, breaking things, and learning from what I broke. \n\nPart of my reason for wanting to learn is professional growth but the other part to be honest is just from being a gamer and programmer, owning top of the line current gen GPUs, and wanting to use them to do cool things.\n\nUpdate: Thanks for your responses everyone.

                "body": "Hi OSDev,\n\nI've  wanted to start a hobby OS project for a while now but I'm struggling  to get started. I'm going to give you some background on what I know and  what I'm trying to do to see if anyone can help me figure out a path  forward with this.\n\n# What I Know So Far:\n\nI'm  a professional software engineer with an M.S. in CompSci. I can  comfortably write and test code. I work with C++ on embedded Linux for my day job so I'm very comfortable with programming on Linux  and I also have little trouble reading hardware documentation,  datasheets, etc. I also have solid knowledge of C and Rust as well as  Python and Java and could easily pick up other PLs as needed. I've worked in assembly language with the MIPS, Arm, and x86-64 architectures in the past but never done anything too complicated with either. I know OS theory from school but am lost when it comes to knowing how to implement any of it on real hardware from scratch. I've perused through the OSDev Wiki but still feel like I'm not entirely sure how to get going.\n\n# What I Want to Do:\n\nMy  goal is to write a working OS kernel to learn as much as possible about bare metal programming and how OSes work and tbh I don't really care to implement any OS component other than the kernel unless it's absolutely  necessary. I ideally want to write something that targets modern  hardware (not legacy) and is decently robust though at the same time  without including anything that isn't absolutely necessary.\n\n# What I don't know:\n\n**What type of project should I aim for?**\n\nThere are two directions I feel like I can go in with an OS project: embedded OS or desktop OS. That said I do want to target 64 bit multi-core application processors and not microcontrollers in either case.\n\nAll design decisions would have to be predicated on that but I don't know which would make more sense since my goals are to learn as much as possible and create a project that can be extended as I learn more. The first choice would admittedly be much easier. I wouldn't need to create a shell, I could get away with only providing cooperative multitasking, real memory virtualization wouldn't be necessary even if there is an MMU present, and things in general would be much easier. But that could also result in not learning near as much so I'm conflicted.\n\n**What architecture should I target for a project like this?**\n\nx86-64?  Aarch64? Both? I have SBCs that could be used for testing on either for  when/if I reach that stage. I've read that x86-64 and the PC platform have the most available learning resources.\n\n**What implementation language and tooling should I use?**\n\nC  is the tried and true and I know it decently well but Rust is also very  interesting though I think there isn't as much learning material. However, Rust comes with a standard build tool and package manager while  C does not and that's before we get to its safety features and high level programming constructs that would ease development. If possible, I'd like to stick to just one high level language to keep things simple though so I'm not sure what to use. For C I'd also need to figure out  what toolchain and other development tools to use and setup.\n\n**What kernel design should I use?**\n\nI've  read the original 90s paper on Exokernel and the newer one on XOMB and  I've definitely been intrigued by the idea of an exokernel setup and  especially the flexibility and performance benefits there but I've also  wondered why there isn't any mainstream OS that uses that design and if there would be enough learning materials to lean on. Other than that, for high performance, a monolithic kernel seems like the only way to go as I've read that microkernels face performance penalties because of all  the IPC involved.\n\n**Would sticking to existing design conventions be better for learning purposes or would deviating be a valuable thing to do?**\n\nWould  it be worthwhile to only support multi-processing but not multi-threading in the same process. Or other unconventional things like that. Would it be a bad idea to do things like that for a first OS project?\n\n**Am I in over my head thinking I can do this at all?**\n\nBe honest with me here, am I better of putting my energy towards a different project?\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read and respond to this."
